impact of covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” outbreak to be a global pandemic covid19 has continued to spread throughout the world and the duration and severity of its effects and associated economic disruption remain uncertain we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business and geographies including the impact on our customers employees suppliers vendors distribution and advertising partners production facilities and various other third parties 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 demand for our advertising products and services decreased due to economic disruptions from limitations on social and commercial activity these economic disruptions and the resulting effect on us eased during the second half of 2020 the pandemic did not have a significant impact on demand during fiscal year 2021 many of our thirdparty production partners that were shut down during most of the second quarter of 2020 due to covid19 restrictions came back online in the third quarter of 2020 and as a result we have incurred additional costs to comply with various governmental regulations and implement certain safety measures for our employees talent and partners additionally certain sporting events that we have rights to were cancelled or postponed thereby eliminating or deferring the related revenues and expenses including the tokyo 2020 olympic games which occurred in july and august 2021 the postponement of the 2020 olympic games deferred both olympicrelated revenues and significant expenses from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 

in response to the impact of the pandemic we employed innovative production and programming strategies including producing content filmed by our onair talent and seeking viewer feedback on which content to air we pursued a number of cost savings initiatives which began during the third quarter of 2020 through the implementation of travel marketing production and other operating cost reductions including personnel reductions restructurings and resource reallocations to align our expense structure to ongoing changes within the industry 

the full extent of covid19’s effects on our operations and results is not yet known and will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and the extent of future surges of covid19 vaccine distribution and other actions to contain the virus or treat its impact among others we will continue to monitor covid19 and its impact on our business results and financial condition the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form 10k reflect management’s latest estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide international networks additionally generates revenues through dtc subscription services 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and fta television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing paytv markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to paytv in mature markets such as western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or fta television environments 

during 2021 advertising distribution and other revenues were 45 47 and 9 respectively of total net revenues for this segment while we have traditionally operated cable networks in recent years an increasing portion of our international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks unlike us networks during 2021 paytv networks generated 33 of international networks advertising revenue and fta or broadcast networks generated 67 of international networks advertising revenue we also have increased efforts to drive revenue growth from digital products such as the dplay dtc entertainment service in select international markets 

international networks largest cost is content expense for localized programming while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from us networks we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from third parties content acquired from us networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly as amortization rates vary by network 

while international networks and us networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations the generation of revenue and the categories of expense international networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220 markets which requires additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations international networks also include sports and fta broadcast channels which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and whollyowned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or whollyowned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties and where we do not own the rights payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks our nonfiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our nonfiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers 

our largest single expense is content which includes content amortization content impairment and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of two to five years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement the majority of our content assets are assessed for impairment within film groups content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present at the respective film group level impairment indicators at the film group represent significant adverse changes that impact the film group as a whole impairment losses are recorded when the carrying value of content assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the respective film group 

competition 

providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership there is competition from other production studios other television networks and onlinebased content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our content viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and digital products which include discovery and other dtc subscription products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and digital products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks streaming services payperview and vod services online activities and other forms of news information and media entertainment 

our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content trademarks in brands names and logos patents protecting novel inventions technology platforms websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance we have also made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and dtc offerings including discovery and consider these platforms to be one of our intellectual property assets to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark patent unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property we use external vendors to detect and remove infringing content and leverage our membership in a range of industry groups to address piracy issues 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the eu in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the fcc including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators and other distributors affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and describe only the most significant regulations we face they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellitedelivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules permit the unaffiliated mvpd to initiate a complaint to the fcc against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated 

program carriage 

the fccs program carriage rules prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated content networks over unaffiliated similarly situated content networks in the rates terms and conditions of carriage agreements between content networks and cable operators or other mvpds recent regulatory changes and court decisions make it more difficult for us to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our content networks or discriminate against one of our content networks 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the communications act the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our content networks by cable and dbs operators the act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of mustcarry and invoking the right to retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers often at a substantial cost that reduces the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

accessibility childrens advertising restrictions emergency alerts and calm act 

certain of our content networks and some of our ipdelivered video content must provide closedcaptioning and audio description of some of their programming and comply with other regulations designed to make our content more accessible our content networks and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on the amount and type of permissible advertising we may not include emergency alert tones or signals in our content commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely impact our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

risk factors related to the combination of discovery and att’s warnermedia business 

on may 17 2021 the company our wholly owned subsidiary drake subsidiary inc att inc “att” and att’s wholly owned subsidiary magallanes inc entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions therein 1 att will transfer the business operations and activities that constitute the warnermedia segment of att subject to certain exceptions the “warnermedia business” to magallanes inc such transfer the “separation” 2 att will distribute to its stockholders the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of magallanes inc held by att such distribution the “distribution” and 3 drake subsidiary inc will merge with and into magallanes inc with magallanes inc as the surviving entity and wholly owned subsidiary of the company such merger the “merger” and the separation distribution and merger collectively the “combination” 

the pendency of the proposed combination may cause disruption in our business 

the definitive agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” related to the combination restricts us from taking specified actions without att’s consent until the combination is completed or the merger agreement is terminated including making certain significant acquisitions or investments entering into certain new lines of business incurring certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds making nonordinary course capital expenditures amending or modifying certain material contracts divesting certain assets including certain intellectual property rights and making certain nonordinary course changes to personnel and employee compensation these restrictions and others more fully described in the merger agreement may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pendency of the proposed combination could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations parties with which we have business relationships including distributors advertisers and content providers may be uncertain as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties 

the pursuit of the combination and the preparation for the integration of the warnermedia business is expected to place a significant burden on our management and internal resources the diversion of management’s attention away from daytoday business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our financial results 

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the combination the substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses relating to the combination and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the combination is consummated we are also subject to litigation related to the proposed combination which could prevent or delay the consummation of the combination and result in significant costs and expenses 

failure to complete the combination in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock as well as our future business and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

we currently anticipate the combination will be completed in the second quarter of 2022 but the combination cannot be completed until conditions to closing are satisfied or if permissible under applicable law waived the combination is subject to numerous closing conditions including approval by discovery’s stockholders receipt of certain regulatory approvals from governmental authorities and atts receipt of a special cash payment in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement by and among discovery att and magallanes inc governmental authorities may not approve the combination may impose conditions to the approval of the combination or may require changes to the terms of the combination any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the combination imposing costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the combination or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the combination we can provide no assurance that these conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the abandonment of the combination 

the satisfaction of the required closing conditions could delay the completion of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring further there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the combination will be satisfied or waived or that the combination will be completed 

if the combination is not completed in a timely manner or at all our ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows 

• we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the combination will be completed 

• we may experience negative reactions from employees customers suppliers or other third parties 

• we may be subject to litigation which could result in significant costs and expenses 

• management’s focus may have been diverted from daytoday business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to discovery and 

• our costs of pursuing the combination may be higher than anticipated 

in addition to the above risks we may be required under certain circumstances to pay att a termination fee equal to 720 million andor to reimburse or indemnify att for certain of its expenses if the combination is not consummated there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our stock price business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

although we expect that the combination will result in synergies and other benefits to us we may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration the achievement of such synergies and other challenges 

discovery and the warnermedia business have operated and until completion of the combination will continue to operate independently and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of any financial or other benefits if we are not able to successfully integrate the warnermedia business with ours or pursue our directtoconsumer strategy successfully including coordinating our streaming services for global customers the anticipated benefits including synergies of the combination may not be realized fully if at all or may take longer than expected to be realized specifically the following issues among others must be addressed in combining the operations of discovery and the warnermedia business in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination 

• combining the businesses of discovery and the warnermedia business in the time frame currently anticipated 

• maintaining existing agreements with customers distributors providers talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers distributors providers talent and vendors 

• combining certain of the businesses’ corporate functions 

• determining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies 

• integrating the businesses’ administrative accounting and information technology infrastructure 

• integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel including talent 

• managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company including with discovery’s limited prior experience in running a studio or scripted content 

• coordinating the businesses’ directtoconsumer streaming services for global customers and 

• resolving potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the combination 

even if the operations of our business and the business of the warnermedia business are integrated successfully the full benefits of the combination may not be realized including among others the synergies that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may also be incurred in the integration of our business and the business of the warnermedia business further it is possible that there could be loss of key discovery or warnermedia business employees loss of customers disruption of either or both of discovery’s or warnermedia business’ ongoing businesses or unexpected issues higher than expected costs and an overall postcompletion process that takes longer than originally anticipated all of these factors could materially adversely affect our stock price business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our consolidated indebtedness will increase substantially following completion of the combination this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

our consolidated indebtedness as of december 31 2021 was approximately 152 billion upon completion of the combination we will become responsible for up to approximatel y 430 billion of additional debt including existing debt of the existing warnermedia business and debt that may be issued by magallanes inc to fund the transactions with the ultimate amount of such debt to be issued subject to certain adjustments including for net working capital in addition subject to certain conditions availability under our revolving credit facility will increase from 25 billion to 60 billion the increased indebtedness could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future in addition the amount of cash required to pay interest on our indebtedness levels will increase following completion of the combination and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than prior to the combination the increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the combination could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures share repurchases investments mergers and acquisitions and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels 

following consummation of the combination our corporate or debtspecific credit rating could be downgraded which may increase our borrowing costs or give rise to a need to refinance existing indebtedness if a ratings downgrade occurs we may need to refinance existing debt or be subject to higher borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants when we incur new debt in the future which could reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility 

risks related to our industry 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries and if we are unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we face increased competitive pressure from subscription based streaming services and dtc offerings including our discovery product and expansion by other companies—in particular technology companies—into the content production and distribution space we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home entertainment such as digital products feature films periodicals interactive entertainment usergenerated content live sports and other events social media and diverse online and mobile activities internetbased advertising including through websites and search engines has seen significant growth placing pressure on traditional advertising models tied to television networks including on freetoair cable network and satellite delivered channels businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our targeted audience with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies distribution platforms and business models and achieve widespread distribution 

in addition our television networks premium paytv and basic tier television services and the discovery platform also face competition from other television networks online platformsstreaming video service providers paytv service providers and independent producers that develop produce acquire and sell entertainment and sports content as competition from these networks service providers and producers continues to increase we may not be able to acquire or create popular entertainment sports and news content or acquire it at a costeffective price as a result of an increasing number of market entrants in the programming space we have seen upward pressure on programming costs in recent years including in connection with the licensing and acquisition of entertainment and sports content from third parties as well as with the commissioning of original production we may also be impacted by such upward pressures driven by increasing investment by competitors in certain international markets regulations concerning content quotas or content investment requirements may be a further factor driving increasing programming costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment and sports content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile  

the production and distribution of entertainment and sports content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024 we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable we could see low viewership which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues the success of our partnership with the pga tour which runs through 2031 is similarly dependent on audience acceptance and viewership failing to gain the level of audience acceptance we expect for the pga tour content may negatively impact our distribution and advertising revenues over the period of the partnership 

the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities our ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending time and attention may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive with respect to advertisingsupported services and the extent of distribution and penetration and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors with respect to subscriptionbased services the appeal success and performance of our content with consumers as well as with thirdparty licensees and other distribution partners are also critical factors that can affect the revenue that we receive with respect to our contentrelated business 

consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and customerviewer reach and adversely affect our results of operations 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly in an environment of fastpaced changes in consumer behavior as well as innovation changes to these business models include a consumers’ increasing demand to consume video content on their own terms including on the screen of their choice at the time of their choice and with enhanced functionality b the presence of streaming services which are increasing in number and some of which have a significant and growing subscriber base c the proliferation of high speed internet connections and the expansion of 5g networks able to support highquality streaming video within increasingly interactive and interconnected digital environments and d the increased video consumption through subscription streaming services and timedelayed or timeshifted viewing of television programming through ondemand services and dvrs as well as the availability of video content through other distribution outlets including digital home entertainment such as electronic sellthrough and transaction videoondemand consumer behavior related to these changes in content distribution viewership and technological innovation are not entirely predictable but remain key factors in our economic model such changes may accordingly materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from streaming services apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices the inability to meet consumer demands and expectations in today’s highly mobile multiscreen and multiplatform environment for video delivery may affect the attractiveness of our offerings ineffective technology and product integration lack of specific features and functionalities poor interface design or ease of use or platform performance issues among other factors may cause viewers to favor alternative offerings additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our advertising revenues in addition there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings likewise distributors are seeking to offer smaller programming packages known as “skinny bundles” which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks that are gaining popularity among consumers if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues 

we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle in 2021 total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 8 while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 4 in order to respond to subscription declines and changes in content distribution models in our industry we have invested in developed and launched dtc products including our discovery product there can be no assurance however that our viewers will respond to our dtc products or that our dtc strategy will be successful particularly given the increase in dtc products on the market each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not ultimately predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

the covid19 pandemic appears to have accelerated some existing trends lockdowns during the pandemic for example encouraged households to experiment with digital offerings including subscription videoondemand or to stack subscriptions although we expect these trends to continue in the coming years our viewership and the profitability of our business may be impacted in unpredictable ways as a result thereof moreover there can be no assurance of the continuation of these trends 

if our dtc product discovery fails to attract and retain subscribers our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in january 2021 discovery launched an aggregated dtc product discovery in the us we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs to develop and market discovery and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace our offering or that subscribers will activate or renew a subscription 

our discovery offering is a subscriptionbased streaming product and is among many such services in a crowded and competitive landscape its success will also be largely dependent on our ability to initially attract and ultimately retain subscribers competitors to discovery include traditional linear programming networks including our own linear channels competing subscription videoondemand services and other digital entertainment platforms and offerings all vying for consumer time attention and discretionary spending if we are unable to effectively market discovery or if consumers do not perceive the pricing and related features of discovery to be of value versus our competitors we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers in particular decreases in consumer discretionary spending where discovery is offered may reduce our ability to attract and retain subscribers to discovery which could have a negative impact on our business relatedly a decrease in viewing subscribers on our advertisingsupported offering of discovery could also have a negative impact on the rates we are able to charge advertisers for advertisingsupported services the ability to attract and retain subscribers will also depend in part on our ability to provide compelling content choices that are differentiated from that of our competitors and that are more attractive than other sources of entertainment that consumers could choose in their free time furthermore our ability to provide a quality subscriber experience and our relative service levels may also impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers if we are unable to attract and retain subscribers to discovery our business could be adversely affected 

consolidation among paytv programming and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us for the us networks segment 84 of our distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the 10 largest cable and satellite operators at us networks that expire at various times from 2022 through 2025 some of our largest distributors have combined and as a result have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our distribution agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with these operators these distribution agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or other factors 

while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue subscriptionbased revenue also represents a significant portion of our revenue our distribution agreements generally have a limited term which varies by territory and distributor and there can be no assurance that these distribution agreements will be renewed in the future or that they will be renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks or a reduction in distributor penetration including as a result of changes in consumer habits could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our distribution agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of a distribution agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production distribution and broadcast of our programming and our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information from time to time hackers and other malicious actors target discovery and our service providers our systems and our service providers’ systems have been breached in the past due to cybersecurity attacks these systems may continue to be breached in the future due to employee error malicious code hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise if our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way such compromises could result in a disruption of services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems 

we also face regulatory risk associated with the acquisition storage disclosure use and protection of personal data including under the eu gdpr the ccpa and various other domestic and international privacy and data security laws and regulations which are continually evolving these evolving data protection laws may require us to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures and our actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has caused substantial disruption in television production financial markets and economies worldwide both of which could result in adverse effects on our business operations stock price and ability to raise capital 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and continues to create significant volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets and while some economic disruption may ease from time to time such disruption is expected to continue and may worsen for an undetermined period of time there is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of the global economic disruption caused by covid19 however a prolonged disruption slowdown or recession could materially adversely affect our credit ratings stock price ability to access capital on favorable terms and ability to meet our liquidity needs 

our businesses as with other businesses globally have been significantly affected by the covid19 pandemic both domestically and internationally including as a result of governmentally imposed shutdowns workforce realignments labor and supply chain interruptions and quarantines and travel restrictions among other factors shutdowns andor restrictions relating to television production activity have impacted and may continue to impact various aspects of project scheduling completion and budgets as well as revenue streams tied to projected release or availability dates all such impacts may continue for an indefinite length of time 

our actions to limit the adverse effects of covid19 on our financial condition may not be successful as the extent and duration of the adverse effects of the pandemic is not determinable and depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted events resulting from the effects of covid19 may negatively impact our ability to comply with our financial covenants also additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if adequate funding is not available we may be required to reduce expenditures including curtailing our growth strategies and reducing our product development efforts or forego acquisition opportunities 

risks related to domestic and foreign laws and regulations and other risks related to international operations 

changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations and other risks related to international operations could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business these obligations and regulations among other things require closed captioning of programming for the hearing impaired require certain content providers to make available audio descriptions of programming for the visually impaired limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown during programming aimed primarily at an audience of children aged 12 and under and require the identification of or the maintenance of lists of sponsors of political advertising see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” that appears above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations that govern our business we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

• laws and policies affecting trade and taxes including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes and changes in these laws 

• local regulatory requirements and any changes to such requirements including restrictions on content censorship imposition of local content quotas local production levies and restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership outsourcing consumer protection intellectual property and related rights including copyright and rightsholder rights and remuneration 

• our ability to obtain the appropriate licenses and other regulatory approvals we need to broadcast content in foreign countries 

• differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property 

• significant fluctuations in foreign currency value 

• currency exchange controls 

• the instability of foreign economies and governments 

• war and acts of terrorism 

• anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and programs administered by the office of foreign assets control that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations 

• foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation and changes in these laws and 

• shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming 

events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects acts of terrorism hostilities imposition of sanctions or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business 

this is of particular concern in poland where we own and operate tvn a portfolio of freetoair and paytv lifestyle entertainment and news networks on december 17 2021 a proposed amendment to the polish broadcasting act commonly referred to as “lex tvn” was presented to the lower chamber of the polish parliament the “sejm” for consideration and was subsequently passed by the sejm lex tvn would prohibit the granting of licenses for television and radio broadcasting channels in poland such as the tvn portfolio of channels to broadcasters with more than 49 of their share capital directly or indirectly controlled by an entity with a registered seat outside of the european economic area essentially precluding noneuropean economic area ownership of media entities in poland lex tvn was presented to the president of poland for consideration and on december 27 2021 the president of poland vetoed lex tvn in the future if legislation similar to lex tvn is enacted it could directly or indirectly affect the future operations of our polish media properties andor modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate in that market in the future 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect the businesses of our partners who might reduce their spending on advertising which could result in a decrease in advertising rates and volume and our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and distribution revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies in addition unforeseeable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios which are used by independent rating agencies to assign short and longterm debt ratings lower debt ratings could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

increasing complexity of global tax policy and regulations could adversely impact our international business and results of operations 

we continue to face the increasing complexity of operating a global business as we are subject to tax policy and regulations in multiple nonus jurisdictions many foreign jurisdictions are contemplating additional taxes andor levies on overthetop services as well as media advertising in addition many foreign jurisdictions have increased scrutiny and have either changed or plan to change their international tax systems due to the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” recommendations the beps recommendations call for enhanced transparency and reporting relating to companies’ entity structures and transfer pricing policies these have been implemented through various initiatives including the requirement for taxpayers to comply with global countrybycountry reporting and the filing of a global master file as well as the introduction of the multilateral instrument “mli” which allows taxing authorities to better take aim at multinational tax avoidance we continue to address and comply with these compliance and reporting requirements recently officials from 136 jurisdictions including the us agreed upon a framework for overhauling the taxation of multinational corporations that includes among other things profit reallocation rules and a 15 global minimum corporate income tax rate these provisions if implemented could have a material effect on our income tax liability 

additional complexity has also arisen in state aid state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between european member states in recent years the european commission “ec” has increased their scrutiny on state aid and deviated from the historical eu state aid practices there is great uncertainty about the future of eu state aid practices based on the appeals of many significant ec rulings against multinational corporations that are currently being challenged the potential impact of these rulings is difficult to assess and our transfer pricing analyses conducted pursuant to accepted oecd methodologies may not sufficiently mitigate risk associated with our past or current agreements continued access at historical levels to production incentive schemes such as tax credits may also be affected by proposed changes in the laws currently under examination 

in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

i n the us the biden administration has issued guidance on certain tax law changes that it would support which include among other things a significant increase in the corporate income tax rate a new alternative minimum tax on book income and changes in the taxation of nonus income there has been recently released proposed legislation that includes among other things a new interest deduction limitation for certain domestic corporations that are member of certain multinational groups while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals if enacted they would have a material impact on our income tax liability  

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 152 billion of consolidated debt of which 339 million is current our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our 25 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

• impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes 

• requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete and 

• placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 

our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

financial performance for our equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair value may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for as investments without readily determinable fair value if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc dcl to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act we were subject to us taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations the company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

risks related to corporate structure 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” qurate retail group fka liberty interactive corporation “qurate retail” liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband and liberty latin america ltd lla which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global qurate retail liberty broadband and lla together the liberty entities own interests in various us and international companies such as charter communications inc charter that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless a such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and b such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our twelveperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse programming partnership advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of qurate retail two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of charter of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of lla john c malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities other than lla and qurate retail the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a1 convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a1 convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 23 of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a1 convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns shares of liberty media representing approximately 48 of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock shares representing approximately 30 of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 6 of the aggregate voting power of qurate retail shares representing approximately 49 of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 20 of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 26 of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our nine common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities hold stock and stockbased compensation in the liberty entities and hold our stock and stockbased compensation 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

• authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock a series b that entitles the holders to ten votes per share a series a1 that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a series c that except as otherwise required by applicable law entitles the holders to no voting rights 

• authorizing the series a1 convertible preferred stock with special voting rights which prohibits us from taking any of the following actions among others without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such stock 

◦ increasing the number of members of the board of directors above ten 

◦ making any material amendment to our charter or bylaws 

◦ engaging in a merger consolidation or other business combination with any other entity and 

◦ appointing or removing our chairman of the board or our chief executive officer 

• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt

• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders 

• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent subject to certain exceptions thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders 

• establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 

• requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80 of our voting power or the approval by at least 75 of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters such as a merger or consolidation a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our charter 

• requiring the consent of the holders of at least 75 of the outstanding series b common stock voting as a separate class to certain share distributions and other corporate actions in which the voting power of the series b common stock would be diluted by for example issuing shares having multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of series a common stock and 

• the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management thereby protecting the continuity of our management or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse each share of advancenewhouse’s series a1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine shares of our series a common stock and each share of advancenewhouse’s series c1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 193648 shares of our series c common stock subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders

general risks 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights underlying our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our content including digital content television networks brands and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in parts of the world that do not effectively enforce intellectual property rights and laws in contrast to territories such as the us and much of europe and the oceania territories even in territories like the us legal frameworks that are unresponsive to modern realities combined with the lack of effective technological prevention and enforcement measures may impede our enforcement efforts our enforcement activities depend in part on third parties including technology and platform providers whose cooperation and effectiveness cannot be assured to any degree in addition technological advances that allow the almost instantaneous unauthorized copying and downloading of content into digital formats without any degradation of quality from the original facilitate the rapid creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to maintain the exclusive control over their copyrighted material and thus the value of their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content we may need to spend significant amounts of money on improvement of technological platform security and enforcement activities including litigation to protect our intellectual property rights any impairment of our intellectual property rights including due to changes in us or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions investments and enter into other strategic transactions such as the scripps acquisition and the pending combination in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers affiliates and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or us department of justice may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past such as the scripps acquisition and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 

• the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations 

• the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• the incurrence of additional operating losses and operating expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested 

• the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration 

• the failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets 

• the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections 

• the potential for patent and trademark infringement and data privacy and security claims against the acquired companies or companies in which we have invested 

• litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions acquired companies or companies in which we have invested 

• the impairment or loss of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations

• our lack of or limitations on our control over the operations of our joint venture companies 

• the difficulty of integrating operations systems and controls as a result of cultural regulatory systems and operational differences 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of particular economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and 

• the impact of known potential liabilities or liabilities that may be unknown including as a result of inadequate internal controls associated with the companies we acquired or in which we invested 

our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities following the completion of a merger like the scripps acquisition or the pending combination current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities which could have an adverse effect on discovery if key employees depart our business may be adversely affected additionally we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile due to circumstances beyond our control 

the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely due to many factors some of which may be beyond our control these factors include without limitation 

• the pendency and completion of the combination including atts decision to conduct the distribution as a pro rata distribution

stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company market fluctuations and anomalous trading activities including sales of large blocks of our series a common stock and series c common stock have caused and may in the future cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time in the normal course of its operations the company is subject to various litigation matters and claims including claims related to employees vendors other business partners or patent issues however a determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the companys results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position future results of operations or cash flows

impact of covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” outbreak to be a global pandemic covid19 has continued to spread throughout the world and the duration and severity of its effects and associated economic disruption remain uncertain we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business and geographies including the impact on our customers employees suppliers vendors distribution and advertising partners production facilities and various other third parties 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 demand for our advertising products and services decreased due to economic disruptions from limitations on social and commercial activity these economic disruptions and the resulting effect on us eased 

during the second half of 2020 the pandemic did not have a significant impact on demand during fiscal year 2021 many of our thirdparty production partners that were shut down during most of the second quarter of 2020 due to covid19 restrictions came back online in the third quarter of 2020 and as a result we have incurred additional costs to comply with various governmental regulations and implement certain safety measures for our employees talent and partners additionally certain sporting events that we have rights to were cancelled or postponed thereby eliminating or deferring the related revenues and expenses including the tokyo 2020 olympic games which occurred in july and august 2021 the postponement of the 2020 olympic games deferred both olympicrelated revenues and significant expenses from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 

in response to the impact of the pandemic we employed innovative production and programming strategies including producing content filmed by our onair talent and seeking viewer feedback on which content to air we pursued a number of cost savings initiatives which began during the third quarter of 2020 through the implementation of travel marketing production and other operating cost reductions including personnel reductions restructurings and resource reallocations to align our expense structure to ongoing changes within the industry 

the full extent of covid19’s effects on our operations and results is not yet known and will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and the extent of future surges of covid19 vaccine distribution and other actions to contain the virus or treat its impact among others we will continue to monitor covid19 and its impact on our business results and financial condition the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form 10k reflect management’s latest estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions 

results of operations 

items impacting comparability 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2021 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2021 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

advertising revenue increased 11 in 2021 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations advertising revenue increased 10 the increase was primarily attributable to improved overall performance at international networks as advertising markets recovered from the covid19 pandemic as well as the broadcast of the summer olympics throughout europe in the third quarter of 2021 

distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing dtc subscription services and other emerging forms of digital distribution the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement and the market demand for the content that we provide from time to time renewals of multiyear carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years in some cases we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content we provide 

as reported and excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increased 11 in 2021 primarily attributable to the growth of discovery at both us networks and international networks

income tax expense was 236 million and 373 million and the companys effective tax rate was 16 and 22 for 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pretax book income and an increase in the deferred tax benefit from the uk finance act 2021 that was enacted in june 2021 those decreases were partially offset by an increase in the state and local income tax expense recorded in 2021 

segment results of operations – 2021 vs 2020

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 28 billion and 27 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income excluding noncash items partially offset by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity

principal payments on longterm debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes at face value assuming repayment will occur upon maturity interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual interest rates and maturity dates 

additionally dcls revolving credit facility allows dcl and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of dcl to borrow up to 25 billion including a 150 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit upon the closing of the combination with warnermedia and subject to certain conditions the available commitments will increase by 35 billion to an aggregate amount not to exceed 6 billion as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility or the commercial paper program see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

purchase obligations 

content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with thirdparty producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks production contracts generally require purchase of a specified number of episodes payments over the term of the license and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place if the content is ultimately never produced our commitments expire without obligation the commitments exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs 

other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable legally binding and specify all significant terms significant purchase obligations include transmission services television rating services marketing commitments and research equipment purchases and information technology and other services some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30day to 60day advance notice without penalty and are not included in the table above past the 30day to 60day advance notice period 

finance lease obligations 

we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multiyear finance lease arrangements principal payments on finance lease obligations reflect amounts due under our finance lease agreements interest payments on our outstanding finance lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our finance lease agreements 

operating lease obligations 

we obtain office space and equipment under multiyear lease arrangements most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration 

pension and other employee obligations 

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan “pension plan” that covers certain usbased employees we also have a nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” 

contractual commitments include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our pension plan in 2022 and estimated benefit payments for our serp that exceed plan assets payments for the serp have been estimated over a tenyear period while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2031 we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period 

we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount of any payments due to cashsettled sharebased compensation awards as of december 31 2021 the current portion of the liability for cashsettled sharebased compensation awards was 17 million  

unrecognized tax benefits 

we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our unrecognized tax benefits because until formal resolutions are reached reasonable estimates of the amount and timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable our unrecognized tax benefits totaled 420 million as of december 31 2021 

put rights 

we have granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries but we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment we recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amount of 363 million see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

noncontrolling interest 

the food network and cooking channel are operated and organized under the terms of the tv food network partnership the partnership we hold interests in the partnership along with another noncontrolling owner the partnership agreement specifies a dissolution date of december 31 2022 if the term of the partnership is not extended prior to that date the partnership agreement permits us as holder of 80 of the applicable votes to reconstitute the partnership and continue its business if for some reason the partnership is not continued it will be required to limit its activities to winding up settling debts liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests 

related party transactions 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties primarily the liberty entities and our equity method investees information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

new accounting and reporting pronouncements 

we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2021 information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to uncertain tax positions goodwill and intangible assets content rights consolidation and revenue recognition we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 

the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions from time to time we engage in transactions or take filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless we determine that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes we include interest and where appropriate potential penalties as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statement of operations this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information the technical merits of the tax positions and the accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained this also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities at december 31 2021 the reserve for uncertain tax positions was 420 million and it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of our uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as 125 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits foreign judicial proceedings lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments the component level reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are as follows us networks europe latin america and asiapacific 

we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is required the quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow “dcf” method and the market multiple approach which incorporates the use of ebitda multiples based on market data for the dcf method we use projections specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires the company to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates control premiums terminal growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows including revenue growth rates and profit margins the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting units budget long range plan and recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions 

2021 impairment analysis 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units and it determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values therefore no quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was performed 

content rights 

content rights principally consist of television series specials films and sporting events costs of produced and coproduced content consist of development costs acquired production costs direct production costs certain production overhead costs and participation costs and are capitalized if we have previously generated revenues from similar content in established markets and the content will be used and revenues will be generated for a period of at least one year 

linear content amortization expense for each period is recognized based on the revenue forecast model which approximates the proportion that estimated distribution and advertising revenues for the current period represent in relation to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues digital content amortization for each period is recognized based on estimated viewing patterns as there are no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets and therefore number of views is most representative of the use of the title judgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of our content assets 

critical assumptions used in determining content amortization include i the grouping of content with similar characteristics ii the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data iii determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model iv assessing the accuracy of our forecasts and v incorporating secondary streams we then consider the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use expected content investment and market trends content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance network affiliate fee rates advertising demand the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving our networks the number of subscribers to our digital services and program usage accordingly we continually review our estimates and planned usage and revise our assumptions if necessary 

consolidation 

we have ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies for each such entity we evaluate our ownership other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether we should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events as part of its evaluation we initially determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity vie management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a vie including whether i the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties ii the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity’s operations and iii the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity if the entity is a vie and if we have a variable interest in the entity we use judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary and are thus required to consolidate the entity in making this determination we evaluate whether we or another party involved with the vie 1 has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie 

if it is concluded that an entity is not a vie we consider our proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidate majorityowned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained a controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive thirdparty participation rights key factors we consider in determining the presence of substantive thirdparty participation rights include but are not limited to control of the board of directors budget approval or veto rights or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming creative development marketing and selection of key personnel ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which we have significant influence are accounted for as equity method 

we evaluated reconsideration events during the year ended december 31 2021 and concluded there were no changes to our consolidation assessments 

revenue recognition 

as described in note 2 we generate advertising revenues primarily from advertising sold on our television networks authenticated tve applications dtc subscription services and websites and distribution revenues from fees charged to distributors of our network content which include cable directtohome satellite telecommunications and digital service providers and bundled longterm content arrangements as well as through dtc subscription services 

a substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the us and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach these advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single distinct performance obligation for such contracts judgment is required in measuring progress across the company’s single performance obligation various factors such as pricing specific to the channel daypart and targeted demographic as well as estimated audience guarantees are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns revenues are ultimately recognized based on the audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression 

see item 1a risk factors for details on significant risks that could impact our ability to successfully grow our cash flows 

for an indepth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our actual and potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2021 we entered into a new 25 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility replacing the existing 25 billion credit agreement we have the capacity to initially borrow up to 25 billion and upon the closing of the proposed combination transaction with warnermedia and subject to certain conditions the available commitments will increase by 35 billion to an aggregate amount not to exceed 6 billion we had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2021 we also have access to a commercial paper program which had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2021 the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on a floating rate based on the applicable currency of the borrowing plus a margin the revolving credit facility matures in june 2026 and the option for up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding debt with a book value of 152 billion under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps or swaptions effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid we may also enter into fixed rate forward starting swaps to limit the impact of volatility in interest rates for future issuances of fixed rate debt as of december 31 2021 we had entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 2 billion for the future issuances of fixed rate debt and a combination of swaption collars purchase payer swaptions and interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of 15 billion for the expected issuances of debt associated with the upcoming warnermedia merger 

as of december 31 2021 the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 172 billion the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from a 100 basispoint increase in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be a decrease in fair value of approximately 15 billion as of december 31 2021 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings our international networks segment operates from hubs in emea latin america and asia with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income other comprehensive income loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro polish zloty and the british pound we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2021 we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and the fair value of investments with readily determinable fair values we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for as equity method investments equity investments and other highly liquid instruments such as money market and mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value see note 4 and note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

impact of covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” outbreak to be a global pandemic covid19 continues to spread throughout the world and the duration and severity of its effects and associated economic disruption remain uncertain restrictions on social and commercial activity in an effort to contain the virus have had and are expected to continue to have a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the us and global economy including the media industry we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business and geographies including the impact on our customers employees suppliers vendors distribution and advertising partners production facilities and various other third parties 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 demand for our advertising products and services decreased due to economic disruptions from limitations on social and commercial activity these economic disruptions and the resulting effect on the company slightly eased during the second half of 2020 but the pandemic continued to impact demand through the end of 2020 and this decreased demand is expected to continue into 2021 many of our thirdparty production partners that were shut down during most of the second quarter of 2020 due to covid19 restrictions came back online in the third quarter of 2020 and as a result we have incurred additional costs to comply with various governmental regulations and implement certain safety measures for our employees talent and partners additionally certain sporting events that we have rights to were cancelled or postponed thereby eliminating or deferring the related revenues and expenses including the tokyo 2020 olympic games which were postponed to 2021 the postponement of the olympic games deferred both olympicrelated revenues and significant expenses from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 

in response to the impact of the pandemic we employed and continue to employ innovative production and programming strategies including producing content filmed by our onair talent and seeking viewer feedback on which content to air we also implemented remote work arrangements effective midmarch 2020 and to date these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to operate our business 

the effects of the pandemic may have further negative impacts on our financial position results of operations and cash flows however we are unable to predict the ongoing impact that covid19 will have on our financial position operating results and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties the nature and extent of covid19’s effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and the extent of future surges of covid19 vaccine distribution and other actions to contain the virus or treat its impact among others we will continue to monitor covid19 and its impact on our business results and financial condition

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide international networks additionally generates revenues through dtc subscription services 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and fta television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing paytv markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to paytv in mature markets such as western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or fta television environments 

during 2020 advertising distribution and other revenues were 42 54 and 3 respectively of total net revenues for this segment while we have traditionally operated cable networks in recent years an increasing portion of our international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks unlike us networks during 2020 paytv networks generated 33 of international networks advertising revenue and fta or broadcast networks generated 67 of international networks advertising revenue we also have increased efforts to drive revenue growth from digital products such as the dplay dtc entertainment service in select international markets 

international networks largest cost is content expense for localized programming while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from us networks we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from third parties content acquired from us networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly as amortization rates vary by network 

while international networks and us networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations the generation of revenue and the categories of expense international networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220 markets which requires additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations international networks also include sports and fta broadcast channels which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” eu law provides for a departing member state to have a twoyear notice period to negotiate a term of exit which the uk triggered in march 2017 and subsequently extended in october 2019 a revised draft withdrawal agreement was published detailing the framework of the future relationship between the uk and the eu this agreement was ratified by the uk and european parliaments and on january 31 2020 the uk formally left the eu brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising subscribers distributors and employees as described in item 1a risk factors below the withdrawal agreement included a transitional period until december 2020 discovery like many international media businesses sought to mitigate this risk by applying for broadcast licenses in remaining eu member states thereby allowing us continued access to the eu single market we have been operating our eu paytv channels under dutch jurisdiction since march 2019 most of our eu free to air channels which were previously operating under the uk authority ofcom are operating under german jurisdiction as of january 1 2021 we continue to monitor the situation for potential effects on our distribution and licensing agreements unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and whollyowned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs production of digitalfirst content such as virtual reality and shortform video is typically done through whollyowned production studios coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks our nonfiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our nonfiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers to that end during 2018 we entered into a 12year partnership with the pga tour that includes tv and online rights to the pga tour outside the united states effective january 1 2019 we announced the launch of golftv a new live and ondemand international video streaming service providing over 2000 hours of live golf programming each year and extensive premium content ondemand discovery expects to invest more than 2 billion over the course of the partnership including licensing rights and building the golftv platform 

our largest single expense is content which includes content amortization content impairment and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of two to four years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded when content asset carrying value exceeds net realizable value 

competition 

providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership there is competition from other production studios other television networks and onlinebased content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our content viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and digital products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and dtc products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks streaming services payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content trademarks in brands names and logos technology platforms websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance we have also made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and dtc offerings and consider these platforms to be one of our intellectual property assets to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property we use external vendors to detect and remove infringing content and leverage our membership in a range of industry groups to address piracy issues 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the eu in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the fcc including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators and other distributors affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellitedelivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules permit the unaffiliated mvpd to initiate a complaint to the fcc against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated 

program carriage 

the fcc recently made changes to the program carriage rules which prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated content networks over unaffiliated similarly situated content networks in the rates terms and conditions of carriage agreements between content networks and cable operators or other mvpds some of these changes could make it more difficult for us to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our content networks or a distributors actions midcontract that discriminate against one of our content networks 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the communications act the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of mustcarry and invoking the right to retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers often at a substantial cost that reduces the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

accessibility childrens advertising restrictions and calm act 

certain of our content networks and some of our ipdelivered video content must provide closedcaptioning and audio description of some of their programming our content networks and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

risks related to our industry 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries  

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we face increased competition from subscription based streaming services and dtc offerings including our recently launched discovery product and we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment and sports content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile  

the production and distribution of entertainment and sports content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024 we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable we could see low viewership which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues the success of our partnership with the pga tour which runs through 2031 is similarly dependent on audience acceptance and viewership failing to gain the level of audience acceptance we expect for the pga tour content may negatively impact our distribution and advertising revenues over the period of the partnership 

the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors 

consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly changes to these business models include a the presence of streaming services which are increasing in number and some of which have a significant and growing subscriber base and b the increased video consumption through subscription steaming services and timedelayed or timeshifted viewing of television programming through ondemand services and dvrs consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from streaming services connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings likewise distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as “skinny bundles” which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks that are gaining popularity among consumers if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues 

we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle in 2020 total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 5 while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3 in order to respond to changes in content distribution models in our industry we have invested in developed and launched dtc products including dplay joyn motortrend and our new discovery product there can be no assurance however that our viewers will respond to our dtc products or that our dtc strategy will be successful particularly given the increase in dtc products on the market each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not ultimately predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

if our new subscription streaming product discovery fails to attract and retain subscribers our business may be adversely impacted 

in january 2021 discovery launched an aggregated dtc product discovery we have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs to develop and market discovery and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace our offering or that subscribers will activate or renew a subscription 

our discovery offering is a subscriptionbased streaming product the subscriptionbased streaming service marketplace is crowded and competitive and our success will also be largely dependent on our ability to initially attract and to ultimately retain subscribers competitors to discovery include traditional linear programming networks including our own linear channels and other subscriptionbased streaming services and dtc offerings if we are unable to effectively market discovery or if consumers do not perceive the pricing and related features of discovery to be of value versus our competitors we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers our ability to attract and retain subscribers to discovery will also depend in part on our ability to provide compelling content choices that are differentiated from that of our competitors and that are more attractive than other sources of entertainment that consumers could choose in their free time furthermore our ability to provide a quality subscriber experience and our relative service levels may also impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers if we are unable to attract and retain subscribers to discovery our business could be adversely affected 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 95 of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in us networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2023 some of our largest distributors have combined and as a result have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our distribution agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with these operators these distribution agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks 

while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our distribution agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these distribution agreements will be renewed in the future or that they will be renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our distribution agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of a distribution agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production distribution and broadcast of our programming and our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information from time to time hackers target discovery and our service providers and our service providers’ systems may be breached due to employee error malicious code hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures notwithstanding our ongoing efforts to develop and implement robust data security tools practices and protocols we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for losses associated with cybersecurity and privacy events 

in addition we face regulatory risk associated with the acquisition storage disclosure use and protection of personal data including under the eu gdpr the ccpa and various other domestic and international privacy and data security laws and regulations which are continually evolving these evolving data protection laws may require us to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures and our actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business operations and poses risks to our business results of operations and financial position the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain rapidly changing and unpredictable 

the continuing global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 commonly called “covid19” has created significant worldwide operational volatility uncertainty and disruption 

countries throughout the world have imposed stringent restrictions on social and commercial activity in an effort to slow the spread of the illness these restrictions vary by location and have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors including the media industry in which we operate the extent of the impact to our business customers employees vendors and our distribution advertising and production partners will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and the extent of future surges of covid19 and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact among others any negative effect on these third parties could materially adversely impact us 

in particular our advertising revenues which represented 52 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 may decrease significantly if our advertising partners in certain sectors such as travel continue to reduce their advertising spending or if we are limited in our ability to create and air new content due to prolonged production shutdowns and delays the covid19 pandemic has caused some of our advertisers to reduce their spending and future declines in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general due to covid19 could continue to negatively impact their advertising expenditures in the future we may continue to experience decreases in advertising revenues related to live sporting events which have been cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic for example the international olympic committee and the tokyo 2020 organizing committee agreed to postpone the 2020 olympic games to 2021 the postponement of the olympic games has delayed our expected olympicrelated revenue further a prolonged global recession due to covid19 may put pressure on household budgets and cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending which may decrease our subscriber numbers distribution revenues and the rates we are able to charge for advertising 

in addition we continue to implement remote work arrangements in various geographic locations while these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to maintain our business operations to date these arrangements may adversely impact our business operations in the future 

the extent to which covid19 will adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors which are highly uncertain rapidly changing and cannot be predicted including 

• the duration and scope of the outbreak including the extent of future surges of the disease vaccine distribution and other actions to contain the virus or treat its impact 

• governmental business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak including travel restrictions quarantines social distancing workathome stayathome and shelterinplace orders and shutdowns 

• the impact of the outbreak on the financial markets and economic activity generally 

• the effect of the outbreak on our investments customers vendors and production partners 

• the impact of the outbreak on the health wellbeing and productivity of our employees and the potential for disruption to our ability to conduct our operations and 

• the ability of our customers to pay for our services during and following the outbreak 

the covid19 pandemic has caused substantial disruption in financial markets and economies worldwide both of which could result in adverse effects on our business operations stock price and ability to raise capital 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption in the credit and financial markets and while some economic disruption may ease from time to time such disruption is expected to continue and may worsen for an undetermined period of time the pandemic and continued spread of covid19 has caused a global recession there is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of such slowdown or recession however a prolonged slowdown or recession may adversely affect our credit ratings stock price ability to access capital on favorable terms and ability to meet our liquidity needs 

our actions to limit the adverse effects of covid19 on our financial condition may not be successful as the extent and duration of the adverse effects of the pandemic is not determinable and depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted events resulting from the effects of covid19 may negatively impact our ability to comply with our financial covenants also additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if adequate funding is not available we may be required to reduce expenditures including curtailing our growth strategies and reducing our product development efforts or forego acquisition opportunities 

risks related to our international operations 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

• laws and policies affecting trade and taxes including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes and changes in these laws 

• changes in local regulatory requirements including restrictions on content imposition of local content quotas and restrictions on foreign ownership 

• differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property 

• significant fluctuations in foreign currency value 

• currency exchange controls 

• the instability of foreign economies and governments 

• war and acts of terrorism 

• anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations 

• foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation and changes in these laws and 

• shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming 

events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and distribution revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

as a company that has operations in the united kingdom the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial position 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom “uk” formally withdrew from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the transition period during which the prebrexit rights and obligations on trade travel and business for the uk and the eu continued to apply ended on december 31 2020 as of january 1 2021 the relationship between the uk and the eu is governed by the euuk trade and cooperation agreement “tca” which is effective provisionally pending ratification by the european parliament 

as a result of brexit the single market and country of origin principles which have facilitated our crossborder activities from the uk into the eu have ceased which could have an adverse impact on our operations and business activities we have incurred and may continue to incur costs including due to reestablishment of broadcasting entities from the uk into the eu staff relocations and business travel to minimize disruption to our businesses in the eu there remains potential legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace andor replicate 

the announcement and implementation of brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations with the expansion of our international operations our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuation has increased this increase in exposure could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances due in part to currency fluctuations impacting the british pound and the euro brexit may also create global uncertainty which may cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions where our networks are distributed a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming could have a negative impact on our distribution revenues and the rates we are able to charge for advertising in addition different market requirements for advertising content may impact our advertising revenues any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial position 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

increasing complexity of global tax policy and regulations could adversely impact our international business and results of operations 

we continue to face the increasing complexity of operating a global business as we are subject to tax policy and regulations in multiple nonus jurisdictions many foreign jurisdictions are contemplating additional taxes andor levies on media advertising including the recently announced proposed levy on media companies under consideration by the polish government in addition many foreign jurisdictions have increased scrutiny and have either changed or plan to change their international tax systems due to the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” recommendations the beps recommendations call for enhanced transparency and reporting relating to companies’ entity structures and transfer pricing policies these have been implemented through various initiatives including the requirement for taxpayers to comply with global countrybycountry reporting and the filing of a global master file as well as the introduction of the multilateral instrument “mli” which allows taxing authorities to better take aim at multinational tax avoidance we continue to address and comply with these compliance and reporting requirements 

additional complexity has also arisen in state aid state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between european member states in recent years the european commission “ec” has increased their scrutiny on state aid and deviated from the historical eu state aid practices there is great uncertainty about the future of eu state aid practices based on the appeals of many significant ec rulings against multinational corporations that are currently being challenged the potential impact of these rulings is difficult to assess and our transfer pricing analyses conducted pursuant to accepted oecd methodologies may not sufficiently mitigate risk associated with our past or current agreements 

in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

in the us president biden put forth several corporate income tax proposals during his campaign including a significant increase in the corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of nonus income while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals if enacted they would have a material impact on our income tax liability 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 154 billion of consolidated debt of which 335 million is current our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our 25 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

• impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes 

• requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete and 

• placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 

our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

financial performance for our equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair value may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for as investments without readily determinable fair value if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act we were subject to us taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations the company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

risks related to corporate structure 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” qurate retail group fka liberty interactive corporation “qurate retail” liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband and liberty latin america ltd lla which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global qurate retail liberty broadband and lla together the liberty entities own interests in various us and international companies such as charter communications inc charter that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless a such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and b such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our twelveperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse programming partnership advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of qurate retail two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of charter of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of lla john c malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities other than lla and qurate retail the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a1 convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a1 convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 24 of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a1 convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns shares of liberty media representing approximately 47 of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock shares representing approximately 30 of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 40 of the aggregate voting power of qurate retail shares representing approximately 48 of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21 of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 27 of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our nine common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities hold stock and stockbased compensation in the liberty entities and hold our stock and stockbased compensation 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

• authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock a series b that entitles the holders to ten votes per share a series a1 that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a series c that except as otherwise required by applicable law entitles the holders to no voting rights

◦ engaging in a merger consolidation or other business combination with any other entity and 

◦ appointing or removing our chairman of the board or our chief executive officer 

• authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt 

• classifying our common stock directors with staggered threeyear terms and having three directors elected by the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors 

• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders

general risks 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operating results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions investments and enter into other strategic transactions such as the scripps acquisition in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers affiliates and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or us department of justice may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past such as the scripps acquisition and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 

• the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations 

• the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management 

• the incurrence of additional operating losses and operating expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested 

• the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration 

• the failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets 

• the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections 

• the potential for patent and trademark infringement and data privacy and security claims against the acquired companies or companies in which we have invested 

• litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions acquired companies or companies in which we have invested 

• the impairment or loss of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations 

• the impairment of relationships with or failure to retain employees of acquired companies or our existing employees as a result of integration of new personnel 

• our lack of or limitations on our control over the operations of our joint venture companies 

• the difficulty of integrating operations systems and controls as a result of cultural regulatory systems and operational differences 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of particular economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and 

• the impact of known potential liabilities or liabilities that may be unknown including as a result of inadequate internal controls associated with the companies we acquired or in which we invested 

our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities following the completion of a merger like the scripps acquisition current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities which could have an adverse effect on discovery if key employees depart our business may be adversely affected additionally we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected

impact of covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak to be a global pandemic covid19 continues to spread throughout the world and the duration and severity of its effects and associated economic disruption remain uncertain restrictions on social and commercial activity in an effort to contain the virus have had and are expected to continue to have a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the us and global economy including the media industry we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business and geographies including the impact on our customers employees suppliers vendors distribution and advertising partners production facilities and various other third parties 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 demand for our advertising products and services decreased due to economic disruptions from limitations on social and commercial activity these economic disruptions and the resulting effect on the company slightly eased during the second half of 2020 but the pandemic continued to impact demand through the end of 2020 and this decreased demand is expected to continue into 2021 many of our thirdparty production partners that were shut down during most of the second quarter of 2020 due to covid19 restrictions came back online in the third quarter of 2020 and as a result we have incurred additional costs to comply with various governmental regulations and implement certain safety measures for our employees talent and partners additionally certain sporting events that we have rights to were cancelled or postponed thereby eliminating or deferring the related revenues and expenses including the tokyo 2020 olympic games which were postponed to 2021 the postponement of the olympic games deferred both olympicrelated revenues and significant expenses from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 

in response to the impact of the pandemic we employed and continue to employ innovative production and programming strategies including producing content filmed by our onair talent and seeking viewer feedback on which content to air we continue to pursue a number of cost savings initiatives which began during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and believe will offset a portion of anticipated revenue losses and deferrals through the implementation of travel marketing production and other operating cost reductions including personnel reductions restructurings and resource reallocations to align our expense structure to ongoing changes within the industry we also implemented remote work arrangements effective midmarch 2020 and to date these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to operate our business 

in addition we implemented several measures to preserve sufficient liquidity in the near term during march 2020 we drew down 500 million under our 25 billion revolving credit facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the current uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid19 in addition in april 2020 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which increased flexibility under our financial covenants and issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may 2030 and 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may 2050 the proceeds from the notes were used to fund a tender offer for 15 billion of certain senior notes with maturities ranging from 2021 through 2023 and to repay the 500 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

in light of the impact of covid19 we assessed goodwill other intangibles deferred tax assets programming assets and accounts receivable for recoverability based upon latest estimates and judgments with respect to expected future operating results ultimate usage of content and latest expectations with respect to expected credit losses we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges of 124 million for our asiapacific reporting unit during 2020 adjustments to reflect increased expected credit losses were not material further hedged transactions were assessed and we have concluded such transactions remain probable of occurrence due to significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid19 management’s judgments could change in the future the effects of the pandemic may have further negative impacts on our financial position results of operations and cash flows however the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of covid19 means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably and fully estimated at this time 

the nature and extent of covid19’s effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and the extent of future surges of covid19 vaccine distribution and other actions to contain the virus or treat its impact among others we will continue to monitor covid19 and its impact on our business results and financial condition our consolidated financial statements reflect management’s latest estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions 

in the united states the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” was enacted on march 27 2020 and the consolidated appropriations act 2021 was enacted on december 27 2020 as of december 31 2020 we do not expect the cares act or the consolidated appropriations act 2021 to have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations we continue to monitor other relief measures taken by the us and other governments around the world 

results of operations 

items impacting comparability 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2020 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2020 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

consolidated results of operations – 2020 vs 2019 

our consolidated results of operations for 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 



nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

our advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of fta television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital products on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

advertising revenue decreased 8 in 2020 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations advertising revenue decreased 7 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in demand stemming from the covid19 pandemic at both us and international networks 

distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement and the market demand for the content that we provide from time to time renewals of multiyear carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years in some cases we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content we provide 

as reported and excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increased 1 in 2020 primarily attributable to changes in contractual affiliate rates at us networks and international networks 

other revenue decreased 16 in 2020 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations other revenue decreased 17 

costs of revenues 

our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense content expense includes television series television specials films sporting events and digital products the costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs participation costs exploitation costs and manufacturing costs 

as reported and excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations costs of revenues increased 1 in 2020 primarily attributable to increases in content amortization from investments to support our next generation initiatives at us networks 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 in 2020 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations selling general and administrative decreased 1 the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in travel costs as a result of covid19 and lower marketingrelated expenses partially offset by an increase in personnel costs to support our next generation platforms including discovery 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets as reported and excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations depreciation and amortization increased 1 in 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was 124 million and 155 million in 2020 and 2019 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges were 91 million and 26 million in 2020 and 2019 restructuring and other charges primarily include employee termination costs and other cost reduction efforts 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased 4 in 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average debt balance in 2020 a more favorable interest rate profile on our outstanding senior notes and incremental interest income related to the change in fair value of our crosscurrency swaps 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in 2020 we repurchased 15 billion aggregate principal amount of dcls and scripps networks senior notes the repurchase resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 76 million the loss included 67 million of net premiums to par value and 9 million of other charges 

loss from equity investees net 

we reported losses from our equity method investees of 105 million in 2020 compared to losses of 2 million in 2019 the changes are attributable to the companys share of earnings and losses from its equity investees 

other income expense net 

the table below presents the details of other income expense net in millions 



income taxes 

the following table reconciles our effective income tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate 



income tax expense was 373 million and 81 million and o ur effective tax rate was 22 and 4 for 2020 and 2019 the increase in income tax expense in 2020 was primarily attributable to the discrete onetime noncash deferred tax benefit of 445 million from legal entity restructurings that was recorded in 2019 additionally the increase in income tax expense in 2020 was attributable to an increase in provision for uncertain tax positions and an increase in the effect of foreign operations those increases were partially offset by a decrease in pretax book income a tax benefit from a favorable multiyear state resolution and a favorable deferred tax adjustment in the us that was recorded in 2020 

segment results of operations – 2020 vs 2019 

we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding i employee sharebased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii restructuring and other charges iv certain impairment charges v gains and losses on business and asset dispositions vi certain intersegment eliminations related to production studios vii thirdparty transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of scripps networks and other transactions and viii other items impacting comparability such as the noncash settlement of a withholding tax claim we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses we exclude sharebased compensation restructuring and other charges certain impairment charges gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period certain corporate expenses and intersegment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives 

adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap”

revenues 

advertising revenue decreased 5 in 2020 primarily attributable to softer demand stemming from the covid19 pandemic secular declines in the paytv ecosystem and to a lesser extent lower overall ratings and a decline in inventory partially offset by increases in pricing and the continued monetization of content offerings on our next generation platforms such as our go suite of tve applications and dtc subscription products 

distribution revenue increased 4 in 2020 primarily attributable to increases in contractual affiliate rates and certain nonrecurring items partially offset by a decline in linear subscribers excluding these nonrecurring items distribution revenue increased 3 in 2020 total portfolio subscribers at december 31 2020 were 5 lower than at december 31 2019 while subscribers to our fully distributed networks were 3 lower than the prior year

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

sources of cash 

historically we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations during 2020 we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations as of december 31 2020 we had 21 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand we are a wellknown seasoned issuer and have the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities including debt securities common stock and preferred stock on short notice subject to market conditions access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured we also have a 25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program described below 

beginning in february 2020 the covid19 pandemic began adversely affecting the availability of borrowings in the commercial paper market in addition during the year ended december 31 2020 we implemented several measures that we believed would preserve sufficient liquidity in the near term in response to the impact of covid19 as discussed further below 

• debt 

2020 senior notes activity 

during 2020 we commenced five separate private offers to exchange the “exchange offers” any and all of discovery communications llcs dcl our whollyowned subsidiary outstanding 5000 senior notes due 2037 6350 senior notes due 2040 4950 senior notes due 2042 4875 senior notes due 2043 and 5200 senior notes due 2047 collectively the “old notes” for one new series of dcl 4000 senior notes due september 2055 the “new notes” we completed the exchange offers in september 2020 by exchanging 14 billion aggregate principal amount of the old notes validly tendered and accepted by us pursuant to the exchange offers for 17 billion aggregate principal amount of the new notes before debt discount of 318 million the new notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and scripps networks on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis the exchange offers were accounted for as a debt modification and as a result thirdparty issuance costs totaling 11 million were expensed as incurred 

also during 2020 we completed offers to purchase for cash the “cash offers” the old notes approximately 22 million aggregate principal amount of the old notes were validly tendered and accepted for purchase by us pursuant to the cash offers for total cash consideration of 27 million plus accrued interest the cash offers resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 5 million 

finally during 2020 dcl issued 20 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2030 and 2050 all of dcls outstanding senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by discovery and scripps networks and contain certain covenants events of default and other customary provisions dcl used the proceeds from the offering to fund a tender offer for 15 billion aggregate principal amount of dcls and scripps networks senior notes which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 71 million and to repay the 500 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility described below 

2019 senior notes activity 

during 2019 dcl issued 15 billion aggregate principal of senior notes the 2029 notes and 2049 notes 

revolving credit facility and commercial paper 

we have access to a 25 billion revolving credit facility borrowing capacity under this credit facility is reduced by the outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program during march 2020 we drew down 500 million under the revolving credit facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid19 and such amount was repaid during the second quarter of 2020 all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by discovery 

the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” contains customary representations warranties and events of default as well as affirmative and negative covenants in the second quarter of 2020 to preserve flexibility in the current environment we amended certain provisions of the credit agreement including modifying the financial covenants to reset the maximum consolidated leverage ratio see note 8 to the accompany consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement 

under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by discovery and scripps networks from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of 15 billion including up to 500 million of eurodenominated borrowings the maturities of these notes vary but may not exceed 397 days the notes may be issued at a discount or at par and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit rating assigned to the notes at the time of issuance as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility described above

our uses of cash have included investments in various equity investments we provide funding to our investees from time to time we contributed 181 million and 254 million in 2020 and 2019 for investments in and advances to our investees 

• redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest 

due to business combinations we also have redeemable equity balances of 383 million which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to the company beginning in 2021 distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests totaled 254 million and 250 million in 2020 and 2019 

• common stock repurchases 

historically we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt in february 2020 our board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to 2 billion upon completion of our existing 1 billion authorization announced in may 2019 under the new stock repurchase authorization management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases subject to market conditions and other factors see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements during 2020 and 2019 we repurchased 969 million and 633 million of our series c common stock

• debt 

2020 debt activity 

in addition to the tender offers for 15 billion aggregate principal amount of dcls and scripps networks senior notes and repayment of the 500 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility described above during 2020 we repaid 600 million of senior notes as they came due we have an additional 335 million of senior notes coming due in june 2021 which will be redeemed on march 21 2021

also during 2019 we redeemed 411 million aggregate principal senior notes made open market bond repurchases of 55 million resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 5 million and redeemed 900 million of senior notes and floating rate notes as they came due 

cash flows 

changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows in millions 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 27 billion and 34 billion in 2020 and 2019 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income excluding noncash items and to a lesser extent a negative fluctuation in working capital activity primarily due to the timing of payments partially offset by an increase in receivables collected 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 703 million and 438 million in 2020 and 2019 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by the purchase of 250 million in time deposit investments in 2020 and to a lesser extent an increase in purchases of property and equipment to support our next generation platforms including discovery partially offset by a reduction in investments in and advances to equity investments 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 15 billion and 24 billion in 2020 and 2019 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net repayments and incremental borrowings of senior notes and the change in net activity under the revolving credit facility partially offset by an increase in repurchases of stock 

capital resources 

as of december 31 2020 capital resources were comprised of the following in millions 

  



we expect that our cash balance cash generated from operations and availability under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months our borrowing costs and access to capital markets can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 

as of december 31 2020 we held 161 million of our 21 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries the 2017 tax act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings notwithstanding the us taxation of these amounts we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the us our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the us however if these funds are needed in the us we would be required to accrue and pay nonus taxes to repatriate them the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable

commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

obligations 

as of december 31 2020 our significant contractual obligations including related payments due by period were as follows in millions 



the above table does not include certain longterm obligations as the timing or the amount of the payments cannot be predicted the current portion of the liability for cashsettled sharebased compensation awards was 37 million as of december 31 2020 additionally reserves for unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above table because we are unable to predict reasonably the ultimate amount or timing of settlement our unrecognized tax benefits totaled 348 million as of december 31 2020

from time to time we may provide our equity method investees additional funding that has not been committed to as of december 31 2020 based on unforeseen investee opportunities or cash flow needs 

longterm debt 

principal payments on longterm debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes at face value assuming repayment will occur upon maturity interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual rate and maturity 

finance lease obligations 

we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multiyear finance lease arrangements principal payments on finance lease obligations reflect amounts due under our finance lease agreements interest payments on our outstanding finance lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our finance lease agreements 

operating lease obligations 

we obtain office space and equipment under multiyear lease arrangements most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration 

purchase obligations 

content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with thirdparty producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks production contracts generally require purchase of a specified number of episodes payments over the term of the license and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place if the content is ultimately never produced our commitments expire without obligation the commitments disclosed above exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs 

other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable legally binding and specify all significant terms significant purchase obligations include transmission services television rating services marketing research employment contracts equipment purchases and information technology and other services we have contracts that do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30day to 60day advance notice without penalty and are not included in the table above past the 30day to 60day advance notice period amounts related to employment contracts include base compensation and do not include compensation contingent on future events 

put rights 

we have granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries which have been excluded from the table above since we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment we recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amount of 383 million see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

pension obligations 

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan “pension plan” that covers certain usbased employees we also have a nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan “serp” 

contractual commitments summarized in the contractual obligations table include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our pension plan in 2021 and estimated benefit payments for our serp payments for the serp have been estimated over a tenyear period while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2030 we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period 

noncontrolling interest 

the food network and cooking channel are operated and organized under the terms of the tv food network partnership the partnership we hold interests in the partnership along with another noncontrolling owner during the fourth quarter of 2020 the partnership agreement was extended and specifies a dissolution date of december 31 2022 if the term of the partnership is not extended prior to that date the partnership agreement permits us as holder of 80 of the applicable votes to reconstitute the partnership and continue its business if for some reason the partnership is not continued it will be required to limit its activities to winding up settling debts liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

related party transactions 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties primarily the liberty entities and our equity method investees information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

new accounting and reporting pronouncements 

we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2020 information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is material to reporting our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions 

we are subject to income taxes in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions from time to time we engage in transactions or takes filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless we determine that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes we include interest and where appropriate potential penalties in our tax reserves this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information the technical merits of the tax positions and the accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained this also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments the component level reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are as follows us networks europe latin america and asiapacific 

we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is required the quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow “dcf” method and the market multiple approach which incorporates the use of ebitda multiples based on market data for the dcf method we use projections specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires the company to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates control premiums terminal growth rates assumed tax rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows including revenue growth rates and profit margins the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting units budget long range plan and recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions 

2020 impairment analysis 

we concluded that the continued impacts of covid19 on the operating results of the europe reporting unit represented a triggering event in the second quarter of 2020 during the second quarter we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for our europe reporting unit using a dcf valuation model a marketbased valuation model was not weighted in the analysis given the significant volatility in the equity markets significant judgments and assumptions in the dcf model included the amount and timing of future cash flows including revenue growth rates longterm growth rates of 2 and a discount rate ranging from 10 to 105 the estimated fair value of the europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded 

also during the second quarter of 2020 we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value was greater than the carrying value for all other reporting units with the exception of the asiapacific reporting unit we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for the asiapacific reporting unit and determined that the estimated fair value did not exceed its carrying value which resulted in a pretax impairment charge to writeoff the remaining 36 million goodwill balance during the second quarter of 2020 the impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes significant judgments and assumptions included the amount and timing of future cash flows including revenue growth rates longterm growth rates ranging from 2 to 25 and a discount rate of 11 the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for the asiapacific reporting unit were based on the reporting unit’s budget and longterm business plan the determination of fair value of our asiapacific reporting unit represents a level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs the goodwill impairment charge did not have an impact on the calculation of our financial covenants under our debt arrangements 

during the third quarter of 2020 we realigned our international networks management reporting structure as a result australia and new zealand which were previously included in the europe reporting unit are now included in the asiapacific reporting unit including the associated goodwill as a result of this realignment we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for our europe and asiapacific reporting units using a dcf valuation model a marketbased valuation model was not weighted in the analysis given the significant volatility in the equity markets significant judgments and assumptions in the dcf model included the amount and timing of future cash flows including revenue growth rates longterm growth rates of 2 for europe and 2 to 25 for asiapacific and a discount rate ranging from 10 to 105 for europe and 11 for asiapacific the estimated fair value of both the europe and asiapacific reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recorded 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units and we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values except for our europe and asiapacific reporting units given limited headroom of below 20 in its europe and asiapacific reporting units during the third quarter of 2020 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for each of these reporting units using a dcf valuation model a marketbased valuation model was not weighted in the analysis due to significant volatility in the reporting units equity markets 

the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for our europe reporting unit indicated that the estimated fair value exceeded its carry value by approximately 20 and therefore no impairment was recorded significant judgments and assumptions included the amount and timing of future cash flows including revenue growth rates longterm growth rate of 2 and discount rates ranging from 105 to 11 we noted that a 10 increase in the discount rate and a 05 decrease in the longterm growth rate would not have resulted in an impairment loss as of december 31 2020 the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the europe reporting unit was 19 billion 

the quantitative impairment analysis for our asiapacific reporting unit indicated that estimated fair value did not exceed its carrying value which resulted in a pretax impairment charge to writeoff the remaining 85 million goodwill balance the impairment was a result of increased cost projections for this region committed to during the fourth quarter of 2020 as part of our global discovery rollout strategy the impairment charge was not deductible for tax purposes significant judgments and assumptions included the amount and timing of future cash flows including revenue growth rates longterm growth rates ranging from 2 to 25 and a discount rate of 11 the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for the asiapacific reporting unit were based on the reporting unit’s budget and longterm business plan the determination of fair value of our asiapacific reporting unit represents a level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs the goodwill impairment charge did not have an impact on the calculation of our financial covenants under our debt arrangements 

content rights 

content rights principally consist of television series specials films and sporting events costs of produced and coproduced content consist of development costs acquired production costs direct production costs certain production overhead costs and participation costs and is capitalized if we have previously generated revenues from similar content in established markets and the content will be used and revenues will be generated for a period of at least one year 

linear content amortization expense for each period is recognized based on the revenue forecast model which approximates the proportion that estimated distribution and advertising revenues for the current period represent in relation to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues digital content amortization for each period is recognized based on estimated viewing patterns as there are no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets and therefore number of views is most representative of the use of the title judgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of our content assets 

critical assumptions used in determining content amortization include i the grouping of content with similar characteristics ii the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data iii determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model iv assessing the accuracy of our forecasts and v incorporating secondary streams we then consider the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use expected content investment and market trends content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance network affiliate fee rates advertising demand the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving our networks the number of subscribers to our digital services and program usage accordingly we continually review our estimates and planned usage and revise our assumptions if necessary 

consolidation 

we have ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies for each such entity we evaluate our ownership other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether we should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events as part of its evaluation we initially determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity vie management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a vie including whether i the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties ii the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity’s operations and iii the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity if the entity is a vie and if we have a variable interest in the entity we use judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary and are thus required to consolidate the entity in making this determination we evaluate whether we or another party involved with the vie 1 has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie 

if it is concluded that an entity is not a vie we consider our proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidate majorityowned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained a controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive thirdparty participation rights key factors we consider in determining the presence of substantive thirdparty participation rights include but are not limited to control of the board of directors budget approval or veto rights or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming creative development marketing and selection of key personnel ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which we have significant influence are accounted for as equity method 

revenue recognition 

as described in note 2 we generate advertising revenues primarily from advertising sold on our television networks and websites and distribution revenues from fees charged to distributors of its network content which include cable directtohome satellite telecommunications and digital service providers and bundled longterm content arrangements as well as through dtc subscription services 

revenue contracts with our advertising customers may include multiple distinct performance obligations for example linear and digital advertising contracts may include the airing of spots andor the satisfaction of an audience guarantee for such contracts judgment is required in allocating the contract value to the individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices various factors such as prior transactions rate cards and other market indicators are used to determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation and accordingly how much revenue is allocated to each performance obligation for these contracts revenue recorded when each performance obligation has been satisfied and value has been transferred to the customer 

a substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the us and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach these advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single distinct performance obligation for such contracts judgement is required in measuring progress across the company’s single performance obligation various factors such as pricing specific to the channel daypart and targeted demographic as well as estimated audience guarantees are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns revenues are ultimately recognized based on the audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression 

see item 1a risk factors for details on all significant risks that could impact our ability to successfully grow our cash flows 

for an indepth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our actual and potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 we had access to a 25 billion revolving credit facility which had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2020 we also have access to a commercial paper program which had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2020 the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt the revolving credit facility matures in august 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding debt with a book value of 158 billion under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid we may also enter into fixed rate forward starting swaps to limit the impact of volatility in interest rates for future issuances of fixed rate debt as of december 31 2020 we had entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 2 billion for the future issuances of fixed rate debt 

as of december 31 2020 the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 187 billion the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from a 100 basispoint increase in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be a decrease in fair value of approximately 17 billion as of december 31 2020 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings our international networks segment operates from hubs in emea latin america and asia cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income loss other comprehensive income loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro polish zloty and the british pound we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net fair market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments intended to hedge future cash flows held at december 31 2020 was a liability value of 24 million most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2020 we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and the fair value of investments with readily determinable fair values we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted as equity method investments equity investments and other highly liquid instruments such as money market and mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value see note 4 and note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

our brands consist of the following 

 



 

 

 



 

 

 

 us networks 

us networks generated revenues of 71 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization adjusted oibda of 41 billion during 2019  which represented 64 and 88 of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our us networks segment principally consists of national television networks our us networks segment owns and operates 18 national television networks including fully distributed television networks such as discovery channel hgtv food network tlc and animal planet in addition we operate the following us networks motortrend investigation discovery travel channel science channel discovery family american heroes channel ahc destination america discovery life diy network cooking channel great american country discovery en español and discovery familia 

us networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our television networks’ first run content which includes cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers referred to as affiliate fees fees from distributors for licensed content and content to equity method investee networks referred to as other distribution revenue fees from advertising sold on our television networks and digital products which include our go suite of tve applications and dtc subscription products fees from providing sales representation network distribution services and revenue from licensing our brands for consumer products our newest dtc product food network kitchen provides multiple revenue streams including advertising and subscription fees during 2019  advertising distribution and other revenues were 60  39 and 1  respectively of total net revenues for this segment 

typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and for annual graduated rate increases carriage of our networks depends on package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages also referred to as digital tiers in the us more than 95 of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2020 through 2024  distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year we provide authenticated us tve streaming products that are available to paytv subscribers and connect viewers through go applications with live and ondemand access to awardwinning shows and series from 18 us networks in the discovery portfolio discovery channel hgtv food network tlc id animal planet travel channel motortrend previously known as velocity science channel diy network cooking channel discovery family channel ahc destination america discovery life discovery en español discovery familia and the oprah winfrey network own a consolidated subsidiary during 2019  we achieved incremental increases in us digital platform consumption we also provide certain networks to consumers as part of subscriptionbased overthetop services provided by directtv now att watch hulu slingtv fubotv and youtube tv 

advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels and leverage multiple platforms to connect advertisers to target audiences in the us advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and by committing to purchase in advance lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce or increase purchase commitments in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates the mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time that upfront sales take place impacting the sellout levels management is willing or able to obtain the demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile 

international networks 

international networks generated revenues of 40 billion and adjusted oibda of 11 billion during 2019  which represented 36 and 23 of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our international networks segment principally consists of national and panregional television networks and brands that are delivered across multiple distribution platforms this segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every paytv market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london amsterdam warsaw milan singapore and miami global brands include discovery channel food network hgtv animal planet tlc id science channel and motortrend previously known as velocity and known as turbo outside of the us along with brands exclusive to international networks including eurosport discovery kids dmax discovery home  health and tvn tvn was acquired in march 2018 as part of our acquisition of scripps networks interactive inc the scripps acquisition as of december 31 2019  international networks operates unique distribution feeds in 50 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities international networks also has fta networks in europe and the middle east and broadcast networks in poland denmark norway and sweden and continues to pursue further international expansion fta and broadcast networks generate a significant portion of international networks revenue the penetration and growth rates of television services vary across countries and territories depending on numerous factors including the dominance of different television platforms in local markets while paytv services have greater penetration in certain markets fta or broadcast television is dominant in others international networks has a large international distribution platform for its 72 networks with as many as 23 networks distributed in any particular country or territory across 220 countries and territories around the world international networks pursues distribution across all television platforms based on the specific dynamics of local markets and relevant commercial agreements with the growing demand of consumer content on digital and mobile devices a suite of international dtc products has been made available to consumers the eurosport player is a video streaming service offering premium and localized sports to fans in 52 markets in europe dplay our reallife entertainment streaming service is now available in 10 markets including the uk ireland spain the nordics japan and italy dplay allows fans to access discovery shows live and ondemand anytime anywhere in germany we have partnered with prosiebensat1 to launch the streaming service joyn which offers the largest collection of freetv content with programming and live streams from more than 50 channels in poland we have partnered with cyfrow polsat to create a video streaming platform that when launched following regulatory clearance will give viewers a single destination to access polish content including movies series documentaries sports and entertainment 

effective january 1 2018 we realigned our international networks management reporting structure which was not affected by the scripps acquisition the table below represents the reporting structures during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 



in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks internationally that utilize the following brands 

 

 



 

our international networks segment also owns and operates the following television networks which reached the following number of subscribers and viewers via pay and fta or broadcast networks respectively as of december 31 2019    



a number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the nordic broadcast networks in sweden norway finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with paytv providers the nordic broadcast networks include kanal 5 kanal 9 and kanal 11 in sweden tvnorge max fem and vox in norway tv 5 kutonen and frii in finland and kanal 4 kanal 5 6eren and canal 9 in denmark 

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide international networks additionally generates revenues through dtc subscription services 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and fta television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing paytv markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to paytv in mature markets such as western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or fta television environments 

during 2019  advertising distribution and other revenues were 45  52 and 3  respectively of total net revenues for this segment while the company has traditionally operated cable networks in recent years an increasing portion of the companys international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks unlike us networks during 2019  paytv networks generated 36 of international networks advertising revenue and fta or broadcast networks generated 64 of international networks advertising revenue the company also has increased efforts to drive revenue growth from digital products such as the dplay dtc entertainment service in select international markets 

international networks largest cost is content expense for localized programming while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from us networks we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from third parties international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion of current estimated revenues relative to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the content of up to four years content acquired from us networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly as amortization rates vary by network more than half of international networks content is amortized using an accelerated amortization method while the remainder is amortized on a straightline basis the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each component of the arrangement 

international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital while international networks and us networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations the generation of revenue and the categories of expense international networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in 220 markets requiring additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations international networks also include sports and fta broadcast channels which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” eu law provides for a departing member state to have a twoyear notice period to negotiate a term of exit which the uk triggered in march 2017 and subsequently extended in october 2019 a revised draft withdrawal agreement was published detailing the framework of the future relationship between the uk and the eu this agreement was ratified by the uk and european parliaments and on january 31 2020 the uk formally left the eu brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising subscribers distributors and employees as described in item 1a risk factors below the withdrawal agreement includes a transitional period until december 2020 which could mitigate against some of these impacts discovery like many international media businesses has sought to mitigate this risk by applying for broadcast licenses in remaining eu member states we have been operating our eu paytv channels under dutch jurisdiction since march 2019 those of our eu free to air channels which were licensed by the uk authority from ofcom will move to a jurisdiction within the eu later this year we continue to monitor the situation for potential effects to our distribution and licensing agreements unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape 

other 

other generated revenues of 11 million during 2019  other is comprised of a production studio that develops content for our networks and other television service providers throughout the world our whollyowned production studio provides services to our us networks and international networks segments at cost the revenues and offsetting expenses associated with these intersegment production services have been eliminated from the results of operations for other our education business was comprised of curriculumbased product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculumbased vod tools professional development services digital textbooks and to a lesser extent student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculumbased content in 2018  we sold an 88 controlling equity stake in our education business to francisco partners for a sale price of 113 million  which resulted in a gain of 84 million upon disposition we retained a 12 ownership interest in the education business which is accounted for as an equity method investment see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

in 2017  the company sold raw and betty llc to all3media all3media is a uk based television film and digital production and distribution company the company owns 50 of all3media and accounts for its investment in all3media under the equity method of accounting 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and whollyowned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs production of digitalfirst content such as virtual reality and shortform video is typically done through whollyowned production studios coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks our nonfiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our nonfiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers to that end during 2018 we entered into a 12year partnership with the pga tour that includes tv and online rights to the pga tour outside the united states effective january 1 2019  we announced the launch of golftv a new live and ondemand international video streaming service providing over 2000 hours of live golf programming each year and extensive premium content ondemand discovery plans to invest more than 2 billion over the course of the partnership including licensing rights and building the golftv platform 

our largest single expense is content which includes content amortization content impairment and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of two to four years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded when content asset carrying value exceeds net realizable value 

competition 

providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership there is competition from other production studios other television networks and onlinebased content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our content viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and digital products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and digital products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent prior to the sale of the education business in 2018  we competed with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content trademarks in brands names and logos technology platforms websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance we have also made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and dtc offerings and consider these platforms to be one of our intellectual property assets to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property we use external vendors to detect and remove infringing content and leverage our membership in a range of industry groups to address piracy issues 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the eu in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the fcc including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators and other distributors affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellitedelivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules permit the unaffiliated mvpd to initiate a complaint to the fcc against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements between content networks subject to these rules and cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the communications act the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of mustcarry and invoking the right to retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

accessibility and advertising restrictions 

certain of our content networks and some of our ipdelivered video content must provide closedcaptioning and video description of some of their programming our content networks and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

risks related to our business 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly changes to these business models include a the presence of streaming services which are increasing in number and some of which have a significant and growing subscriber base and b the increased video consumption through subscription steaming services and timedelayed or timeshifted viewing of television programming through ondemand services and dvrs consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from streaming services connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings likewise distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as “skinny bundles” which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks that are gaining popularity among consumers if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle in 2019  total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 5 while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3  in order to respond to changes in content distribution models in our industry we have invested in developed and launched dtc products including food network kitchen dplay joyn motortrend and others there can be no assurance however that our viewers will respond to our dtc products or that our dtc strategy will be successful particularly given the increase in dtc products on the market each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 95 of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in us networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2024  some of our largest distributors have combined and as a result have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment and sports content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile 

the production and distribution of entertainment and sports content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024 we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable we could see low viewership which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues the success of our partnership with the pga tour which runs through 2031 is similarly dependent on audience acceptance and viewership failing to gain the level of audience acceptance we expect for the pga tour content may negatively impact our distribution and advertising revenues over the period of the partnership 

the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a company that has operations in the united kingdom the vote by the united kingdom to leave the eu could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government has negotiated the terms of the uk’s formal departure from the eu after several delays the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 the formal departure includes a transitional period until december 31 2020 during which the current rights and obligations on trade travel and business for the uk and eu will continue to apply the future relationship between the uk and the eu remains to be negotiated negotiations will start shortly and are intended to produce a free trade deal by december 31 2020 

there is still considerable political uncertainty around the outcome of brexit the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets beyond the transitional period the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more complex which could involve operational changes in order to protect delay and reduce the scope of our distribution and licensing agreements without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the uk distribute our services in europe or to launch new dtc services 

in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace andor replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for workrelated matters 

the announcement of brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations with the expansion of our international operations our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuation has increased this increase in exposure could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances as there can be no assurance that the downward trend of the british pound and the euro will rebound brexit may also create global uncertainty which may cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions where our networks are distributed a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming could have a negative impact on our distribution revenues and the rates we are able to charge for advertising in addition different market requirements for advertising content may impact our advertising revenues any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial position 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we face increased competition from subscription based streaming services and dtc offerings and we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our distribution agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with these operators these distribution agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks 

while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our distribution agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these distribution agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our distribution agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of a distribution agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming from time to time hackers continue to target discovery and our systems may be breached due to employee error malicious code hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures notwithstanding our ongoing efforts to develop and implement robust data security tools practices and protocols any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for losses associated with network security and privacy events 

in addition we face regulatory risk associated with the acquisition storage disclosure use and protection of personal data including under the european union general data protection regulation gdpr the california consumer privacy act ccpa and various other domestic and international privacy and data security laws and regulations which are continually evolving these evolving data protection laws may require discovery to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures and discoverys actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties 

financial performance for our equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair value may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for as investments without readily determinable fair value if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value 

our ongoing efforts to integrate the scripps networks business with our own may not yield the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or we may be unable to manage our expanded operations either of which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our organization procedures and operations with those of scripps networks such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes policies procedures locations operations technologies and systems to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales service operations payroll pricing marketing and employee benefits integration expenses could particularly in the short term exceed the cost synergies we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 following the merger the size and complexity of the business of the combined company increased significantly our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger 

general risks 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

 events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and distribution revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions investments and enter into other strategic transactions including the transaction with scripps networks in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers affiliates and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or us department of justice may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 



 our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities with respect to the scripps networks acquisition our success depends in part upon our ability to retain key employees following the completion of a merger like the scripps acquisition current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities which could have an adverse effect on discovery if key employees depart the integration of scripps networks with discovery may be more difficult and our business may be adversely affected additionally we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

increasing complexity of global tax policy and regulations could adversely impact our international business and results of operations 

we continue to face the increasing complexity of operating in multiple nonus jurisdictions many of which have increased scrutiny and have either changed or plan to change their international tax systems due to the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” recommendations the beps recommendations call for enhanced transparency and reporting relating to companies’ entity structures and transfer pricing policies these have been implemented through various initiatives including the requirement for taxpayers to comply with global countrybycountry reporting and the filing of a global master file as well as the introduction of the multilateral instrument “mli” which allows taxing authorities to better take aim at multinational tax avoidance we continue to address and comply with these compliance and reporting requirements 

additional complexity has also arisen in state aid state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between european member states in recent years the european commission “ec” has increased their scrutiny on state aid and deviated from the historical eu state aid practices there is great uncertainty about the future of eu state aid practices based on the appeals of many significant ec rulings against multinational corporations that are currently being challenged while any potential impact of these rulings is difficult to assess we believe our transfer pricing analyses conducted pursuant to accepted oecd methodologies assist in mitigating risk associated with our past or current agreements 

in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

risks related to our debt 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 154 billion of consolidated debt of which 609 million is current our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our 25 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

risks related to corporate structure 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act we were subject to us taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations the company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” qurate retail group fka liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband and liberty latin america ltd lla which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 47 of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 30 of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 40 of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive shares representing approximately 48 of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21 of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 28 of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities hold stock and stockbased compensation in the liberty entities and hold our stock and stockbased compensation 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 



 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s series a1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine shares of our series a common stock and advancenewhouse’s series c1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 193648 shares of our series c common stock subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders 

for corporate matters other than the election of directors mr malone and advancenewhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 21 and 24  respectively of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock with respect to the election of directors mr malone controls approximately 28 of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse the “an preferred stock” has not been converted into shares of our common stock the an preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board subject to certain conditions but does not carry voting rights with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors also under the terms of the an preferred stock advancenewhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws fundamental changes in our business mergers and other business combinations certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock although there is no stockholder agreement voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr malone and advancenewhouse by virtue of their respective holdings mr malone and advancenewhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders

consolidated results of operations – 2019 vs 2018 

our consolidated results of operations for 2019 and 2018 were as follows in millions 



nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

our advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of fta television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital products on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

advertising revenue increase d 10 for the year ended december 31 2019  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations advertising revenue increase d 12  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations advertising revenue increase d 3  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the increase was primarily a result of an increase of 3 and 4 at us networks and international networks respectively increases at us networks were attributable to increases in pricing and to a lesser extent the continued monetization of digital content offerings and inventory partially offset by lower overall ratings and the secular declines in the pay television ecosystem increases at international networks were primarily driven by the consolidation of the uktv lifestyle business growth in dtc initiatives and to a lesser extent higher pricing in certain markets in europe partially offset by the impact of the olympics in 2018 

distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement and the market demand for the content that we provide from time to time renewals of multiyear carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years in some cases we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content we provide 

distribution revenue increase d 7 for the year ended december 31 2019  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increase d 9  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increase d 5  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the increase was primarily a result of an increase of 5 at both us networks and international networks increases at us networks were attributable to increases in contractual affiliate rates and additional carriage on virtual multichannel video programming distributors partially offset by a decline in overall subscribers increases at international networks were primarily attributable to the impact of certain content licensing arrangements in our latin america business unit higher affiliate rates in europe and monetization of dtc initiatives in europe and asia 

we also generate other revenue associated with content production from our production studio prior to the sale of the education business in april 2018 we generated other revenue from curriculumbased products and services the licensing of our brands for consumer products and thirdparty content sales 

other revenue decrease d 47 for the year ended december 31 2019  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations other revenue decrease d 45  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations other revenue decrease d 47  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the decrease was primarily a result of decreases of 29 and 50 at us networks and international networks respectively the decreases were primarily attributable to the impact of sublicensing of olympics sports rights in 2018 

revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “segment results of operations” 

costs of revenues 

our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense content expense includes television series television specials films sporting events and digital products the costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs participation costs exploitation costs and manufacturing costs 

costs of revenues decrease d 3 for the year ended december 31 2019  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations costs of revenue decrease d 1  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations costs of revenue decrease d 6  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease of 5 and 6 at us networks and international networks respectively as reported content rights expense was  29 billion for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  decreases at us networks were primarily driven by lower content amortization due to content synergies related to the integration of scripps networks decreases at international networks were primarily attributable to the impact of costs related to the olympics in 2018 partially offset by higher investments in linear content and our dtc initiatives and consolidation of the uktv lifestyle business 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees selling general and administrative expenses increase d 6 for the year ended december 31 2019  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations selling general and administrative increase d 11  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations selling general and administrative expenses increase d 3  on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the increase was primarily a result of an increase of 11 at international networks partially offset by a 3 decline at us networks increases at international networks were primarily due to investments in technology and personnel as well as higher marketing expenses driven by subscriber acquisition costs for our dtc initiatives partially offset by the olympics and certain channel launches in asia in 2018 decreases at us networks were primarily driven by cost reductions in personnel technology and professional services fees partially offset by higher marketing expenses in support of our dtc initiatives 

impairment of goodwill 

goodwill impairment expense of 155 million was recorded during the year ended december 31 2019  there was no goodwill impairment expense recorded for the year ended december 31 2018  see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets depreciation and amortization decreased 4 for the year ended december 31 2019  the decrease is primarily attributable to amortization related to the advertising revenue backlog intangible recorded as part of the acquisition of scripps networks which had a oneyear useful life and was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2019 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges were 26 million and 750 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the restructuring and other charges for the year ended december 31 2018 included content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of scripps networks costs associated with the termination of longterm programming arrangements and lease exit costs 

gain on disposition 

there was no gain on disposition for the year ended december 31 2019  for the year ended december 31 2018 there was a gain of 84 million due to the sale of a controlling stake in the education business in april 2018 see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased 7 during the year ended december 31 2019  the decrease was primarily attributable to interest income related to the change in fair value of the companys cross currency swaps and an overall reduction in debt levels see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss from equity investees net 

we reported losses from our equity method investees of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to losses of  63 million for the year ended december 31 2018  the changes are attributable to the companys share of earnings and losses from its equity investees see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

other expense net 

the table below presents the details of other income expense net in millions 



income taxes 

the following table reconciles the companys effective income tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate 



income tax expense was 81 million and 341 million  and our effective tax rate was 4 and 33 for 2019 and 2018  respectively the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily attributable to the discrete onetime noncash deferred tax benefit of 445 million from legal entity restructurings discussed below additionally the decrease in income tax expense was attributable to a decrease in the provision for uncertain tax positions and a decrease in the effect of foreign operations which was mainly driven by the establishment of certain valuation allowances during the year ended december 31 2018 that did not recur in 2019 and a tax benefit realized during the year ended december 31 2019 from the final regulations related to the determination of the foreign tax credit released by the us treasury department and irs in december 2019 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in income and the impact of a goodwill impairment charge that was nondeductible for tax purposes during the year ended december 31 2019  finally the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018 included a onetime discrete tax benefit from us legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions 

we carried out numerous internal transactions during the year ended december 31 2019 that were intended to integrate assets acquired from the scripps networks business with the discovery business streamline and simplify our corporate entity structures simplify our internal financing structures respond to the expected exit of the united kingdom from the european union make our managerial structures and processes more efficient and nimble and reduce costs associated with the maintenance of legal entities these transactions included mergers liquidations and intercompany sales among members of the consolidated discovery group some of these transactions have resulted in changes in certain of our deferred tax items which are based on differences between the book versus tax bases of the assets and liabilities and on certain tax attributes such as net operating loss carryovers the items involved in these restructurings relate to a variety of jurisdictions in our international networks segment recent changes in accounting for intercompany transactions have also impacted our effective tax rate for example following our adoption of accounting standards update 201616 effective january 1 2018 the income tax effects of intercompany transfers will be recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs rather than amortized over time which will increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in the periods in which the transfers occur moreover us tax reform has a continued effect as the us treasury department issues final regulations clarifying application of the new law and several tax controversies have come to resolution the net effect of the various changes in our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances has been the recognition of a onetime noncash deferred income tax benefit of 445 million during the year ended december 31 2019  

segment results of operations – 2019 vs 2018 

we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding i employee sharebased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii restructuring and other charges iv certain impairment charges v gains and losses on business and asset dispositions vi certain intersegment eliminations related to production studios vii thirdparty transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of scripps networks and other transactions and viii other items impacting comparability such as the noncash settlement of a withholding tax claim we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses we exclude sharebased compensation restructuring and other charges certain impairment charges gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period certain corporate expenses and intersegment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives 

adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

effective january 1 2019 our definition of adjusted oibda was modified to exclude all employee sharebased compensation whereas only marktomarket sharebased compensation was previously excluded over time the company has moved to a higher percentage of equityclassified awards in lieu of liabilityclassified awards which require marktomarket accounting under its stock incentive plans and expects to continue this practice in future periods since most equity classified awards are noncash expenses not entirely under management control we have elected to exclude all sharebased compensation from adjusted oibda beginning in 2019 the revised definition of adjusted oibda was used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019 accordingly prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the current definition 

additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

items impacting comparability 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2019 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2019 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies selling general and administrative expense as presented below excludes sharebased compensation and transaction and integration costs related to scripps networks and other transactions due to their impact on comparability between periods 

the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our consolidated results is as follows dollar amounts in millions 



the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our financial results for international networks is as follows dollar amounts in millions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is material to reporting our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

uncertain tax positions 

the company is subject to income taxes in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions from time to time the company engages in transactions or takes filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due the company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless the company determines that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes the company includes interest and where appropriate potential penalties in its tax reserves this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information the technical merits of the tax positions and the timely identification and accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on the companys tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained this also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments the component level reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are as follows us networks europe latin america and asiapacific 

we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is required the quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow “dcf” method and the market multiple approach which incorporates the use of ebitda multiples based on market data for the dcf method we use projections specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires the company to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates control premiums terminal growth rates assumed tax rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows including revenue growth rates and profit margins the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting units budget long range plan and recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their carrying values except for its asiapacific reporting unit for the asiapacific reporting unit the company then performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test which indicated limited headroom the excess of fair value over carrying value of 10 

given the limited headroom in the asiapacific reporting unit the company closely monitored its results during 2019 during the third quarter due to an increasingly challenging business environment in the asiapacific region which included 1 moderating revenue growth projections 2 underperformance of certain sports investments 3 heightened volatility in china and surrounding economies and 4 a decline in asiapacific stock price multiples for peer media companies the company believed the increased risk required it to perform an interim impairment test the step 1 test utilized a dcf valuation methodology significant judgments and assumptions included the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates ranging from 2 to 25 and a discount rate of 11 the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for the asiapacific reporting unit were based on the reporting units budget and longterm business plan the results of the step 1 test indicated that the carrying value of the net assets in the asiapacific reporting unit exceeded its fair value 

in the second step of the impairment test the company hypothetically assigned the asiapacific reporting units fair value to its individual assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names in a hypothetical purchase price allocation that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination the fair value estimates incorporated in step 2 for the hypothetical intangible assets were based on the excess earnings income approach for customer relationships and the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks key judgments made by management in step 2 of the impairment test included revenue growth rates length of contract term number of renewals customer attrition rates marketbased royalty rates and marketbased tax rates the step 2 impairment test indicated an implied fair value of goodwill of 40 million which resulted in a pretax impairment charge of 155 million during the three months ended september 30 2019 

in 2019 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units based on our policy of performing a quantitative impairment test every three years irrespective of the outcome of the qualitative assessment the europe reporting unit which had headroom of 19 was the only reporting unit with fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20 during our annual impairment testing we evaluated the sensitivity of our most critical assumption the discount rate and determined that a 100 basis point change in the discount rate selected would not have impacted the test results additionally the company could reduce the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points and the fair value of the europe reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value as of december 31 2019 the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the europe reporting unit was 19 billion management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities additionally as the europe reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant us dollar denominated assets changes in foreign exchange rates that result in strengthening of the us dollar may negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value 

content rights 

content rights principally consist of television series specials films and sporting events costs of produced and coproduced content consist of development costs acquired production costs direct production costs certain production overhead costs and participation costs and is capitalized if the company has previously generated revenues from similar content in established markets and the content will be used and revenues will be generated for a period of at least one year 

linear content amortization expense for each period is recognized based on the revenue forecast model which approximates the proportion that estimated distribution and advertising revenues for the current period represent in relation to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues digital content amortization for each period is recognized based on estimated viewing patterns as there are no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets and therefore number of views is most representative of the use of the title significant judgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of the company’s content assets 

critical assumptions used in determining content amortization include i the grouping of content by network and or genre ii the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model based on the historical data iii determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the revenue forecast model iv assessing the accuracy of the companys revenue forecasts and v incorporating secondary streams the company then considers the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use expected content investment and market trends content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance network affiliate fee rates advertising demand the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving the company’s networks the number of subscribers to our digital services and program usage accordingly the company continually reviews revenue estimates and planned usage and revises its assumptions if necessary 

consolidation 

the company has ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities including corporations partnerships and limited liability companies for each such entity the company evaluates its ownership other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether it should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events as part of its evaluation the company initially determines whether the entity is a variable interest entity vie management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a vie including whether i the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties ii the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity’s operations and iii the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity if the entity is a vie and if the company has a variable interest in the entity the company uses judgment in determining if it is the primary beneficiary and is thus required to consolidate the entity in making this determination the company evaluates whether it or another party involved with the vie 1 has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and 2 has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie 

if it is concluded that an entity is not a vie the company considers its proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidates majorityowned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained a controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive thirdparty participation rights key factors considered by the company in determining the presence of substantive thirdparty participation rights include but are not limited to control of the board of directors budget approval or veto rights or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming creative development marketing and selection of key personnel ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which the company has significant influence are accounted for as equity method 

revenue recognition 

during 2018 we updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as described in note 2 the company generates advertising revenues primarily from advertising sold on its television networks and websites and distribution revenues from fees charged to distributors of its network content which include cable directtohome satellite telecommunications and digital service providers and bundled longterm content arrangements as well as through dtc subscription services 

revenue contracts with our advertising customers may include multiple distinct performance obligations for example linear and digital advertising contracts may include sponsorship production or product integration in addition to the airing of spots and the satisfaction of an audience guarantee for such contracts judgment is required in allocating the contract value to the individual performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices various factors such as prior transactions rate cards and other market indicators are used to determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation and accordingly how much revenue is allocated to each performance obligation for these contracts revenue recorded when each performance obligation has been satisfied and value has been transferred to the customer 

a substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the us and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach these advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single distinct performance obligation for such contracts judgement is required in measuring progress across the company’s single performance obligation various factors such as rate cards and audience guarantees are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns revenues are ultimately recognized based on the audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression 

the company also enters into certain distribution contracts with customers that include promises to deliver content libraries there are generally two types of such arrangements 1 content licensing arrangements that include subscription video on demand “svod” licensing arrangements and 2 digital dtc content such as vod and authenticated tve applications which is a performance obligation within our distribution arrangements these contracts vary by customer and in certain instances include a promise to deliver existing content and new content in these arrangements the individual program titles delivered represent a distinct performance obligation 

for svod arrangements which typically contain a fixed fee revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on that performance obligations relative standalone selling price if multiple individual program titles are included in the same licensing contract each program is considered distinct and therefore a separate performance obligation various factors such as the length of the license term program exclusivity and historical performance on our linear networks are used to determine the standalone selling price of each program and accordingly how much revenue is allocated to each performance obligation in contracts where existing individual program titles are delivered at the onset of the arrangement revenue is recognized at that time based on the relative standalone selling price of additional individual program titles more revenue is recognized during the contract term as additional performance obligations are satisfied via the delivery of these individual program titles in the case of digital dtc content content is regularly refreshed over the term of the agreement as new titles are added and older titles are removed consequently satisfaction of the performance obligations generally occurs in the same pattern as the delivery of the linear feed the company evaluates arrangements to assess whether there is material value associated with content delivered at the outset of a fixed price contract if there is material value then company allocates contract consideration to those deliverables for purposes of revenue recognition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our actual and potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2019  we had access to a 25 billion revolving credit facility which had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2019  we also have access to a commercial paper program which had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2019  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt the revolving credit facility matures in august 2022 and the option for up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding debt with a book value of 155 billion under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid the company may also enter into fixed rate forward starting swaps to limit the impact of volatility in interest rates for future issuances of fixed rate debt as of december 31 2019  the company had entered into one forward starting interest rate swap agreement for future issuance of fixed rate debt 

as of december 31 2019  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 171 billion  the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 14 billion as of december 31 2019  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings our international networks segment operates from hubs in emea latin america and asia cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income loss other comprehensive income loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro polish zloty and the british pound we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net fair market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments intended to hedge future cash flows held at december 31 2019 was an asset value of 15 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2019  we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and the fair value of investments with readily determinable fair values we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted as equity method investments equity investments and other highly liquid instruments such as money market and mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees equity investments and equity securities was 17 billion at december 31 2019  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

 us networks 

us networks generated revenues of  64 billion  and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization adjusted oibda of 35 billion  during 2018  which represented 60  and 85  of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our us networks segment principally consists of national television networks our us networks segment owns and operates 18  national television networks including fully distributed television networks such as discovery channel tlc food network hgtv and animal planet 

on march 6 2018 we completed the acquisition of scripps networks interactive inc the scripps acquisition and added hgtv food network travel channel diy network cooking channel and great american country to our us networks segment 

us networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our television networks’ first run content which includes cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers referred to as affiliate fees fees from distributors for licensed content and content to equity method investee networks referred to as other distribution revenue fees from advertising sold on our television networks and digital products which include our go suite of tve applications and our virtual reality product discovery vr fees from providing sales representation network distribution services and revenue from licensing our brands for consumer products during 2018  distribution advertising and other revenues were 39  59 and 2  respectively of total net revenues for this segment 

typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and for annual graduated rate increases carriage of our networks depends on package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages also referred to as digital tiers we provide authenticated us tv everywhere streaming products that are available to paytv subscribers and connected viewers through go applications with live and ondemand access to awardwinning shows and series from 18  us networks in the discovery portfolio discovery channel hgtv food network tlc id animal planet travel channel motortrend previously known as velocity science channel diy network cooking channel discovery family channel american heroes channel ahc destination america discovery life discovery en espanol discovery familia and great american country in addition the oprah winfrey network own a consolidated subsidiary as of november 30 2017  is currently on the watch own application during 2018  we achieved incremental increases in us digital platform consumption we also provide certain networks to consumers as part of subscriptionbased overthetop services provided by directtv now att watch hulu slingtv fubotv sony vue and philo 

advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels and leverage multiple platforms to connect advertisers to target audiences in the us advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and by committing to purchase in advance lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce or increase purchase commitments in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates the mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time that upfront sales take place impacting the sellout levels management is willing or able to obtain the demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile 

 in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks in the us that utilize the following brands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international networks 

international networks generated revenues of 41 billion  and adjusted oibda of 11 billion  during 2018  which represented 39  and 26  of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our international networks segment principally consists of national and panregional television networks and brands that are delivered across multiple distribution platforms this segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every paytv market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london warsaw milan singapore and miami global brands include discovery channel food network hgtv animal planet tlc id science channel and motortrend previously known as velocity and known as turbo outside of the us along with brands exclusive to international networks including eurosport discovery kids dmax discovery home  health and tvn tvn was acquired in march 2018 as part of the scripps acquisition as of december 31 2018  international networks operated over 400  unique distribution feeds in over 50  languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities international networks also has fta networks in europe and the middle east and broadcast networks in poland denmark norway and sweden and continues to pursue further international expansion fta and broadcast networks generate a significant portion of international networks revenue the penetration and growth rates of television services vary across countries and territories depending on numerous factors including the dominance of different television platforms in local markets while paytv services have greater penetration in certain markets fta or broadcast television is dominant in others international networks has a large international distribution platform for its 75  networks with as many as 14  networks distributed in any particular country or territory across the more than 220  countries and territories around the world international networks pursues distribution across all television platforms based on the specific dynamics of local markets and relevant commercial agreements 

effective january 1 2018 we realigned our international networks management reporting structure which was not affected by the scripps acquisition the table below represents the reporting structures during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 



in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks internationally that utilize the following brands 

 

 

 



our international networks segment also owns and operates the following regional television networks which reached the following number of subscribers and viewers via pay and fta or broadcast networks respectively as of december 31 2018    



a number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the nordic broadcast networks in sweden norway finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with paytv providers the nordic broadcast networks include kanal 5 kanal 9 and kanal 11 in sweden tv norge max fem and vox in norway tv 5 kutonen and frii in finland and kanal 4 kanal 5 6eren and canal 9 in denmark 

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and fta television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets 

during 2018  distribution advertising and other revenues were 50  43  and 7  respectively of total net revenues for this segment while the company has traditionally operated cable networks in recent years an increasing portion of the companys international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks unlike us networks during 2018  paytv networks generated 38  of international networks advertising revenue and fta or broadcast networks generated 62  of international networks advertising revenue 

international networks largest cost is content expense for localized programming disseminated via more than 400  unique distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from us networks we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from third parties international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion of current estimated revenues relative to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the content of up to five years content acquired from us networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly as amortization rates vary by network more than half of international networks content is amortized using an accelerated amortization method while the remainder is amortized on a straightline basis the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each component of the arrangement 

while international networks and us networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations the generation of revenue and the categories of expense international networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220  markets requiring additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations international networks also include sports and fta broadcast channels which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks 

on june 23 2016  the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” eu law provides for a departing member state to have a twoyear notice period to negotiate a term of exit which the uk triggered on march 27 2017 on november 22 2018  a draft withdrawal agreement was published detailing the framework of the future relationship between the uk and the eu this agreement has not yet been ratified by the uk and european parliaments and negotiations continue to find a mutually acceptable text in time for the deadline of march 29 2019 brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising subscribers distributors and employees as described in item 1a risk factors below we continue to monitor the situation for potential effects to our distribution and licensing agreements unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape 

education and other 

education and other generated revenues of  54 million  during 2018  which represented 1  of our total consolidated revenues our education business was comprised of curriculumbased product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculumbased vod tools professional development services digital textbooks and to a lesser extent student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculumbased content on april 30 2018  we sold an 88 controlling equity stake in our education business to francisco partners for a sale price of 113 million  which resulted in a gain of 84 million upon disposition we retained a 12 ownership interest in the education business which is accounted for as an equity method investment see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements other is comprised of a production studio that develops content for our networks and other television service providers throughout the world our whollyowned production studio provides services to our us networks and international networks segments at cost the revenues and offsetting expenses associated with these intersegment production services have been eliminated from the results of operations for education and other 

on april 28 2017  the company sold raw and betty llc to all3media all3media is a uk based television film and digital production and distribution company the company owns 50  of all3media and accounts for its investment in all3media under the equity method of accounting 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and whollyowned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs production of digitalfirst content such as virtual reality and shortform video is typically done through whollyowned production studios coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks our nonfiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our nonfiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers to that end during 2018  we entered into a 12year partnership with the pga tour that includes tv and online rights to the pga tour outside the united states effective january 1 2019  we announced the launch of golftv a new live and ondemand international video streaming service providing over 2000  hours of live golf programming each year and extensive premium content ondemand discovery plans to invest more than 2 billion  over the course of the partnership including licensing rights and building the golftv platform 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairment and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of three  to four  years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded when content asset carrying value exceeds net realizable value 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital products and from fees charged to distributors who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite telecommunication and digital service providers other transactions include curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services production studios content development and services content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2018  distribution advertising and other revenues were 43  52  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenues no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2018  2017  or 2016  

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discoverys network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement and the market demand for the content that we provide from time to time renewals of multiyear carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years in some cases we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

in the us more than 96  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2019 through 2023  outside of the us approximately 39  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

advertising 

our advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing paytv markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to paytv in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or fta television environments 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of fta television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital products on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with content production from our production studio prior to the sale of the education business on april 30 2018 we generated income from curriculumbased products and services the licensing of our brands for consumer products and thirdparty content sales 

competition 

providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership there is competition from other production studios other television networks and onlinebased content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our content viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and digital products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and digital products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent prior to the sale of the education business on april 30 2018  our education business competed with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the eu in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators and other distributors affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellitedelivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules permit the unaffiliated mvpd to initiate a complaint to the fcc against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements between content networks subject to these rules and cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the communications act the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of mustcarry and invoking the right to retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

accessibility and advertising restrictions 

certain of our content networks and some of our ipdelivered video content must provide closedcaptioning and video description of some of their programming our content networks and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several digital products and websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services we must design and operate our digital products and websites in compliance with these laws and regulations in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

risks related to our business 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings likewise distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as “skinny bundles” which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks that are gaining popularity among consumers if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle in 2018  total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 4  while subscribers to our fully distributed networks were consistent with the prior year  each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 96  of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors for the international networks segment approximately 39  of distribution revenue comes from the 10 largest distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in us networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2023  some of our largest distributors have combined and as a result have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024 we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable we could see low viewership which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues 

the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a company that has operations in the united kingdom the vote by the united kingdom to leave the eu could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government has begun negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu ratification should be finalized by march 29 2019 although there is still considerable political uncertainty around the outcome the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more complex which could involve operational changes in order to protect delay and reduce the scope of our distribution and licensing agreements without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the uk or distribute our services in europe discovery like many international media businesses has sought to mitigate this risk by applying for broadcast licenses in remaining eu member states there can be no assurance that this will be successful in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for workrelated matters 

the announcement of brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations with the expansion of our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation has increased this increase in exposure could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances as there can be no assurance that the downward trend of the british pound and the euro will rebound brexit may also create global uncertainty which may cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending these decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions where our networks are distributed this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming which could in turn have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and distribution revenues a decrease in our viewing subscribers would have a negative impact on the number of viewers watching our programming possibly impacting the rates we are able to charge for advertising any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial position 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming our systems may be breached due to employee error malicious code hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures notwithstanding our ongoing efforts to develop and implement robust data security tools practices and protocols any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

in addition we face regulatory risk associated with the acquisition storage disclosure use and protection of personal data including under the european union general data protection regulation gdpr and various other domestic and international privacy and data security laws and regulations which are continually evolving these evolving data protection laws may require discovery to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures and discoverys actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties 

financial performance for our equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair value may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for as investments without readily determinable fair value if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value 

we may not be able to successfully integrate the scripps networks business with our own realize the anticipated benefits of the scripps networks acquisition or manage our expanded operations any of which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our organization procedures and operations with those of scripps networks such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes policies procedures locations operations technologies and systems to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales service operations payroll pricing marketing and employee benefits integration expenses could particularly in the short term exceed the cost synergies we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 following the merger the size and complexity of the business of the combined company increased significantly our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger 

general risks 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

 events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects 

furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions investments and enter into other strategic transactions including the transaction with scripps networks in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers affiliates and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or us department of justice may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 



 our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities with respect to the scripps networks acquisition our success depends in part upon our ability to retain key employees following the completion of a merger like the scripps acquisition current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities which could have an adverse effect on discovery if key employees depart the integration of scripps networks with discovery may be more difficult and our business may be adversely affected additionally we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

us tax reform could adversely impact our international business and results of operations 

recently enacted us tax reform could adversely impact our business and results of operations on december 22 2017 president trump signed the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja which includes a broad range of tax reform regulations affecting businesses including corporate tax rates business deductions and international tax provisions some of the changes like the new tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income has had an adverse impact to the results of our international operations others like the reduction to the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 has had a positive impact to our overall tax liability and some like the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat have resulted in little or no impact additional guidance continues to be issued through treasurys proposed and final regulations and we continue to assess their impact 

outside of the us we continue to face the increasing complexity of operating in multiple nonus jurisdictions many of which have increased scrutiny and have either changed or plan to change their international tax systems due to the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” recommendations the beps recommendations call for enhanced transparency and reporting relating to companies’ entity structures and transfer pricing policies these have been implemented through various initiatives including the requirement for taxpayers to comply with global countrybycountry reporting and the filing of a global master file as well as the introduction of the multilateral instrument “mli” which allows taxing authorities to better take aim at multinational tax avoidance we continue to address and comply with these compliance and reporting requirements 

additional complexity has also arisen in state aid state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between european member states in recent years the european commission “ec” has increased their scrutiny on state aid and deviated from the historical european union “eu” state aid practices there is great uncertainty about the future of eu state aid practices based on the appeals of many significant ec rulings against multinational corporations that are currently being challenged while any potential impact of these rulings is difficult to assess we believe our transfer pricing analyses conducted pursuant to accepted oecd methodologies assist in mitigating risk associated with our past or current agreements 

in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

risks related to our debt 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 17 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases of which 19 billion  is current our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our 25 billion  revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

risks related to corporate structure 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject under the tcja we were subject to us taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations the company intends to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” and liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global liberty interactive and liberty broadband together the liberty entities own interests in various us and international companies such as charter communications inc charter that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our twelveperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010  and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of liberty interactive two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband and one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of charter of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest john c malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a1 convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a1 convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 24  of the voting power of our outstanding shares   the series a1 convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 46  of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 28  of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 38  of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive shares representing approximately 46  of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21  of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 28  of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own stock and stock incentives of the liberty entities and own our stock and stock incentives 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s series a1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine shares of our series a common stock and advancenewhouse’s series c1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 193648  shares of our series c common stock subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders 

for corporate matters other than the election of directors mr malone and advancenewhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 21  and 24  respectively of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock with respect to the election of directors mr malone controls approximately 28  of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse the “an preferred stock” has not been converted into shares of our common stock the an preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board subject to certain conditions but does not carry voting rights with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors also under the terms of the an preferred stock advancenewhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws fundamental changes in our business mergers and other business combinations certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock although there is no stockholder agreement voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr malone and advancenewhouse by virtue of their respective holdings mr malone and advancenewhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders

results of operations – 2018  vs 2017 

the discussion below compares our actual and pro forma combined results for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  to the twelve months ended december 31 2017  respectively as if the own and mtg transactions and the acquisition of scripps networks collectively the transactions occurred on january 1 2017 management believes reviewing our actual operating results in addition to combined pro forma results is useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of our businesses this information has not been prepared in accordance with gaap is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to gaap please see our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k our combined us networks international networks and corporate and intersegment eliminations pro forma information is based on the historical operating results of the respective businesses as applicable to each segment and includes adjustments directly attributable to the transactions as if they had occurred on january 1 2017 such as 



adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the acquired businesses since january 1 2017 and should not be taken as indicative of the companys future consolidated results of operations

consolidated results of operations – 2018  vs 2017 

our consolidated results of operations for 2018  and 2017  were as follows in millions 



nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution distribution revenue increase d 31  primarily due to the impact of the transactions excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increase d 3  increases at international networks were primarily driven by increases in subscribers to our linear networks and higher digital subscription revenues and increases in pricing in europe and latin america increases at us networks were principally attributable to an increase in contractual affiliate rates which was partially offset by a decline in subscribers and to a lesser extent the timing of content deliveries under svod arrangements 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels market demand the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory advertising revenue increase d 79  primarily due to the impact of the transactions excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations advertising revenue increase d 3  the increases were due to continued monetization of our digital content offerings an increase in pricing at us networks and the olympics 

other revenue increase d 54  primarily due to the impact of the transactions excluding the impact of the transactions and on a pro forma combined basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations other revenue increase d 8  the increases were primarily due to sublicensing of olympics sports rights to broadcast networks throughout europe partially offset by the education and other revenue that decreased   66  following the disposition of the education business on april 30 2018 see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “segment results of operations” 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues increase d 48  primarily due to the impact of the transactions the companys principal component of costs of revenues is content expense content expense includes television series television specials films sporting events and digital products the costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of film costs participation costs exploitation costs and manufacturing costs content rights expense excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was  29 billion  and  19 billion  for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively excluding the impact of the transactions and foreign currency fluctuations costs of revenue increase d 5  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis costs of revenues increase d 2  the increases were primarily due to spending on the olympics at international networks partially offset by the impact of higher content impairment expenses recorded in the prior year at us networks and the impact of the disposition of the education business on a pro forma combined basis and excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations content expense was 30 billion  for each of the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  content impairment is generally a component of costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations however during the year ended december 31 2018  content impairments of 405 million were reflected as a component of restructuring and other charges as a result of the strategic programming changes following the acquisition of scripps networks no content impairments were recorded as a component of restructuring and other charges during the year ended december 31 2017  

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees selling general and administrative expenses increase d 48  primarily due to the impact of the transactions excluding the impact of the transactions directly related thirdparty transaction and planned integration costs and foreign currency fluctuations selling general and administrative expenses increase d 6  primarily due to increased marketing spend at international networks increased sharebased compensation expense chargebacks to an equity method investee in the prior year that is now consolidated and increases in technology costs and tax advisory fees partially offset by decreases at education and other following the disposition of the education business on april 30 2018 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and on a pro forma combined basis selling general and administrative expenses were largely consistent with the prior year 

impairment of goodwill 

no goodwill impairment expense was recorded during the year ended december 31 2018  goodwill impairment expense of  13 billion  was recognized during the year ended december 31 2017  see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets depreciation and amortization increased   11 billion  primarily due to the impact of the transactions on a pro forma combined basis depreciation and amortization expense decreased 249 million  primarily due to pro forma amortization in 2017 related to the ad revenue backlog intangible which had a oneyear useful life and was fully amortized on a pro forma basis in 2017   

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges increased   675 million  primarily as a result of content impairments associated with changes in programming strategies involuntary severance actions associated with the integration of scripps networks costs associated with the termination of longterm programming arrangements and lease exit costs see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements on a pro forma combined basis restructuring and other charges increased   685 million  we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration expenses related to employee and contract terminations relocation from the companys silver spring headquarters to new york city and content costs 

gain loss on disposition 

we recorded an 84 million  gain during the year ended december 31 2018  due to the sale of a controlling stake in the education business on april 30 2018 compared with a loss of 4 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  due to the disposition of the raw and betty production studios see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense increased  254 million  primarily due to interest accrued on higher debt balances including the senior notes issued on september 21 2017  and term loans outstanding from march 6 2018  through september 30 2018 the senior notes and term loans were used to effect the acquisition of scripps networks see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

on march 13 2017  we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of 600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our thenoutstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13 2017  as a result we recognized a 54 million loss on extinguishment of debt which included 50 million for premiums to par value 2 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs 1 million for the writeoff of the original issue discount of these senior notes and 1 million accrued for other thirdparty fees see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss from equity investees net   

the loss from our equity method investees decreased  148 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily due to a reduction in losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy and to a lesser extent inclusion of equity earnings as a result of the acquisition of scripps networks partially offset by the absence of earnings from the companys equity method investment in own and impairments of 29 million  see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

other expense net 

the table below presents the details of other income expense net in millions 



total other expense net increased  10 million  in 2018 compared to 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018  we recorded losses on common stock investments with readily determinable fair value due to the adoption of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments guidance on january 1 2018 which requires us to record gains and losses on equity investments with readily determinable fair values in other expense net previously unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income the increase in foreign currency losses for the year ended december 31 2018 was mostly related to remeasurement of net monetary assets and transactions associated with the polish zloty the euro and other european currencies partially offset by a reduction in losses associated with the british pound we recorded gains on derivative instruments for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to losses for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to losses of 98 million recorded during the prior year on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollardenominated senior notes on september 21 2017 and to a lesser extent gains recorded in the current year on the equity collar used to mitigate the risk of market fluctuations with respect to 50  of the lionsgate shares held by the company and foreign currency swaps see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements on november 30 2017 the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own we recognized a remeasurement gain of  33 million  to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 4950 equity interest see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table reconciles the companys effective income tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate 



income tax expense was 341 million  and 176 million  and our effective tax rate was 33  and 128  for 2018  and 2017  respectively   during 2018 the increase in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income a reduction in benefits from investment tax credits from our renewable energy investments the effect of foreign operations which included the establishment of valuation allowances and writeoffs of deferred tax assets and elimination of the domestic production activity deduction partially offset by the lower us federal statutory income tax rate a decrease in expense for uncertain tax positions and a tax benefit from tcja rate change on the deferred tax liability recomputation as a result of us legislative changes that extended the accelerated deduction of qualified film productions 

in connection with the acquisition of scripps networks we recorded reserves in purchase accounting totaling 110 million for foreign tax matters claimed by tax authorities that are currently pending resolution after the purchase accounting measurement period closes on march 5 2019 any adjustment to these estimated amounts resulting from their resolution will affect net income in the period resolved 

segment results of operations – 2018  vs 2017 

we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding i marktomarket sharebased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii restructuring and other charges iv certain impairment charges v gains and losses on business and asset dispositions vi certain intersegment eliminations related to production studios and vii thirdparty transaction costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of scripps networks we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses we exclude marktomarket sharebased compensation restructuring and other charges certain impairment charges gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and scripps networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period certain corporate expenses and intersegment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives 

adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

the table below presents our adjusted oibda by segment with a reconciliation of consolidated net income available to discovery inc to total adjusted oibda in millions 



the table below presents the calculation of total adjusted oibda in millions 



a    selling general and administrative expenses exclude marktomarket sharebased compensation and scripps networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods 

effective january 1 2019 our definition of adjusted oibda was modified to exclude all sharebased compensation whereas only marktomarket sharebased compensation is excluded for each of the periods presented herein during 2018 the company began granting a higher percentage of equity classified awards in lieu of liability classified awards which require marktomarket accounting under its stock incentive plans and expects to continue this action in future periods since most equity classified awards are noncash expenses not entirely under management control the company has elected to exclude all sharebased compensation from adjusted oibda beginning in 2019 the revised definition of adjusted oibda will be used by our chief operating decision maker in evaluating segment performance in 2019 

the following table presents adjusted oibda as historically reported and under the revised definition

items impacting comparability 

from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods in comparing the financial results for the years 2018 and 2017 in addition to the transactions the company has identified foreign currency as one such item as noted below 

foreign currency 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2018 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2018 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies selling general and administrative expense as presented below excludes marktomarket sharebased compensation and scripps networks transaction and integration costs due to their impact on comparability between periods 

the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our consolidated results is as follows dollar amounts in millions

nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenue increased 8 in 2017 compared to 2016 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increased 7 us networks distribution revenue increases were driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in svod revenue partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 5 for the year ended december 31 2017 while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3 for the same period international networks distribution revenue increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in europe following further investment in sports content and to a lesser extent increases in latin america due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements these increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in asia 

advertising revenue increased 3 in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase for our us networks was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our go platform partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines international networks increases were primarily due to increased volume across key markets in europe particularly southern europe and germany and latin america the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia 

other revenue increased 4 compared with the prior year primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the mtg joint venture then known as vten during the third quarter of the current year see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues increased 9 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations own and mtg transactions and the group nine transaction costs of revenues increased 7 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on content at our international networks segment particularly sports rights and associated production costs content amortization was 19 billion and 17 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations own and mtg transactions selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to transaction costs for the scripps networks acquisition and integration costs of 79 million including the 35 million charge associated with the modification of advancenewhouses preferred stock see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill 

goodwill impairment expense of 13 billion was recognized during the year ended december 31 2017 see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization was consistent for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with the prior period as capital spending has remained consistent over the periods 

restructuring and other charge s 

restructuring and other charges increased 17 million the increase was primarily due to higher personnelrelated termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss gain on disposition 

the change in loss gain on disposition was 67 million we recorded a 4 million loss for the year ended december 31 2017 due to the sale of the raw and betty production studios on april 28 2017 compared with a gain of 63 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the gain on disposition recorded for the year ended december 31 2016 is comprised of the 50 million gain for the deconsolidation of our digital networks business seeker and sourcefed studios in connection with the group nine transaction and the 13 million gain due to the disposition of our radio businesses in the nordics see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 122 million for the year ended december 31 2017   primarily due to costs incurred for the unsecured bridge loan commitment as well as interest accrued on the senior notes issued on september 21 2017 for the financing of the scripps networks acquisition see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

on march 13 2017 we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of 600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our thenoutstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13 2017 as a result we recognized a 54 million loss on extinguishment of debt which included 50 million for premiums to par value 2 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs 1 million for the writeoff of the original issue discount of the existing senior notes and 1 million accrued for other thirdparty fees see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss from equity investees net 

losses from our equity method investees increased 173 million primarily due to losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy partially offset by increases in earnings at own and decreases in losses at all3media see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

other expense income net 

the table below presents the details of other expense net in millions 



other expense increased 114 million in 2017 we recorded foreign currency losses during 2017 compared to foreign currency gains during 2016 mostly due to exchange rate changes on the us dollar compared with the british pound that impacted foreign currency monetary assets increases in losses from derivative instruments primarily resulted from losses of 98 million on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollardenominated senior notes which were settled on september 21 2017 the interest rate contracts did not receive hedging designation the losses were partially offset by various other items including a gain of 17 million on previously settled interest rate contracts for which the hedged issuance of debt is considered remote following the issuance of the senior notes on september 21 2017 see note 9 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements on november 30 2017 the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own we recognized a remeasurement gain to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of our previously held 4950 equity interest see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

income taxes

income tax expense was 176 million and 453 million and our effective tax rate was 128 and 27 for 2017 and 2016 respectively during 2017 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of noncash goodwill impairment charges that are nondeductible for tax purposes thereafter the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to investment tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments and to a lesser extent the domestic production activity deduction benefit the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions and the impact of the tcja see note 18 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements the benefits were partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2017 in 2016 we favorably resolved multiyear state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions that did not recur in 2017

 we expect to continue to make payments for vested cashsettled sharebased awards actual amounts expensed and payable for cashsettled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding during 2018 no payments were made for cashsettled sharebased awards as of december 31 2018 liabilities totaled 54 million  for outstanding liabilityclassified sharebased compensation awards of which 23 million  was classified as current see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows in millions 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 947 million  for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in income following the acquisition of scripps networks partially offset by cash paid for interest and spending on content including sports rights 

cash provided by operating activities increased 249 million for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to a 253 million decrease in cash paid for taxes the decrease in cash paid for taxes net for the year ended december 31 2017 is mostly due to the tax impact from our investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy see note 5 and note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements declines in working capital primarily due to changes in accounts receivable were offset by a decrease in the net negative effect of foreign currency and increases in payables 

investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities increased 80 billion  for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of scripps networks partially offset by a reduction in payments for investments see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

cash flows used in investing activities increased 377 million for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was mostly attributable to an increase in payments for investments of 172 million including renewable energy projects and payments for derivative instruments of 98 million that did not receive hedge accounting but economically hedged pricing risk for the senior notes issued september 21 2017 

financing activities 

cash flows provided by financing activities decreased 62 billion  for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2017  the decrease was primarily attributable to net borrowings in 2017 used to finance the acquisition of scripps networks offset by decreases in cash used to buy back stock and increases in issuances of commercial paper 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased 71 billion for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition of scripps networks see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and a decrease in repurchases of stock of 771 million offset by an increase in principal repayments of debt 

capital resources 

as of december 31 2018  capital resources were comprised of the following in millions 

  



a interest on senior notes is paid annually semiannually or quarterly our senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2018  had interest rates that ranged from 190 to 635 and will mature between 2019 and 2047 

we expect that our cash balance cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 

as of december 31 2018  we held 242 million  of our 986 million  of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries the tcja enacted on december 22 2017 featured a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings the us taxation of these amounts notwithstanding we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the us our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the us however if these funds are needed in the us we would be required to accrue and pay nonus taxes to repatriate them the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable

new accounting and reporting pronouncements 

we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2018  information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 with respect to our accounting policy for goodwill we further supplement disclosures in note 2 with the following 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments the component level reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are as follows us networks europe latin america and asiapacific 

we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit if a quantitative test is performed if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is not required 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units this assessment included but was not limited to consideration of the results of the companys most recent quantitative impairment test consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key personnel and the companys share price based on this assessment the company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values except for its asiapacific reporting unit 

based on the results of the qualitative assessment the company performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test comparison of fair value to carrying value for its asiapacific reporting unit which indicated limited headroom the excess of fair value over carrying value of 10 in performing the step 1 test the company determined the fair value of its asiapacific reporting unit by using a combination of discounted cash flow dcf analyses and marketbased valuation methodologies the results of these valuation methodologies were weighted 50 towards the dcf analyses and 50 towards the marketbased approach the models relied on significant judgments and assumptions surrounding general market conditions shortterm growth rates a terminal growth rate of 25 and detailed management forecasts of future cash flow projections fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 12 during our annual impairment testing we evaluated the sensitivity of our most critical assumption the discount rate and determined that a 100 basis point change in the discount rate selected would not have impacted the test results additionally the company could reduce the terminal growth rate from its current 25 to 20 and the fair value of the asiapacific reporting unit would still exceed its carrying value as of december 31 2018 the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the asiapacific reporting unit was 188 million management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities see item 1a risk factors for details on all significant risks that could impact the companys ability to successfully grow its cash flows additionally as the asiapacific reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant us dollar denominated assets changes in foreign exchange rates that result in strengthening of the us dollar may negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value 

for an indepth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our actual and potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2018  we had access to a 25 billion  revolving credit facility with outstanding borrowings of 225 million  as of december 31 2018  we also have access to a commercial paper program and had no  outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2018  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt the revolving credit facility provides for a maturity date of august 11 2022  and the option for up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding debt with a book value of 167 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates and 400 million  with a floating interest rate 

in 2017 we entered into a delayed draw unsecured term loan credit facility with threeyear and fiveyear tranches each with a principal amount of up to 1 billion  the term loans interest rates were based at the companys option on either adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin as of december 31 2018  we had repaid the term loans in full 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid as of december 31 2018  we have no outstanding interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2018  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 163 billion  the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 11 billion  as of december 31 2018  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings our international networks segment operates from the following hubs emea latin america and asia cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income loss other comprehensive income loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro polish zloty and the brazilian real we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments intended to hedge future cash flows held at december 31 2018  was an asset value of 10 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2018  we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and the fair value of investments with readily determinable fair values we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted as equity method investments equity investments and other highly liquid instruments such as money market and mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees equity investments and equity securities were 935 million  456 million  and 502 million  respectively at december 31 2018  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

international networks 

international networks generated revenues of 33 billion  and adjusted oibda of 859 million  during 2017  which represented 48  and 34  of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our international networks segment principally consists of national and panregional television networks and brands that are delivered across multiple distribution platforms this segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every paytv market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london warsaw milan singapore and miami global brands include discovery channel animal planet tlc id science channel and turbo known as velocity in the us along with brands exclusive to international networks including eurosport discovery kids dmax and discovery home  health as of december 31 2017  international networks operated over 400  unique distribution feeds in over 40  languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities international networks also has fta networks in europe and the middle east and broadcast networks in denmark norway and sweden and continues to pursue further international expansion fta and broadcast networks generate a significant portion of international networks revenue the penetration and growth rates of television services vary across countries and territories depending on numerous factors including the dominance of different television platforms in local markets while paytv services have greater penetration in certain markets fta or broadcast television is dominant in others international networks has a large international distribution platform for its 37  networks with as many as 14  networks distributed in any particular country or territory across approximately 220  countries and territories around the world international networks pursues distribution across all television platforms based on the specific dynamics of local markets and relevant commercial agreements 

effective january 1 2018 we realigned our international networks management reporting structure the table below represents the reporting structures during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 



in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks internationally that utilize the following brands 



 

 

 

our international networks segment also owns and operates the following regional television networks which reached the following number of subscribers and viewers via pay and fta or broadcast networks respectively as of december 31 2017    



a number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the nordic broadcast networks in sweden norway finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with paytv providers the nordic broadcast networks include kanal 5 kanal 9 and kanal 11 in sweden tv norge max fem and vox in norway tv 5 kutonen and frii in finland and kanal 4 kanal 5 6eren and canal 9 in denmark 

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers internet protocol television iptv and overthetop operators ott international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in international markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships with terms generally shorter than similar customers in the us distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across other distribution platforms similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and fta television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over all media platforms in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets 

during 2017  distribution advertising and other revenues were 57  41  and 2 respectively of total net revenues for this segment while the company has traditionally operated cable networks in recent years an increasing portion of the companys international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks unlike us networks during 2017  fta or broadcast networks generated 54  of international networks advertising revenue and paytv networks generated 46  of international networks advertising revenue 

international networks largest cost is content expense for localized programming disseminated via more than 400  unique distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from us networks we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and 

sporting events from third parties international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion of current estimated revenues relative to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the content of up to five years content acquired from us networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly as amortization rates vary by network more than half of international networks content is amortized using an accelerated amortization method while the remainder is amortized on a straightline basis the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each component of the arrangement 

while international networks and us networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations the generation of revenue and the categories of expense international networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220 markets requiring additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations international networks also include sports and fta broadcast channels which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” after a preliminary phase of negotiations towards the end of 2017 the uk government and the eu will in 2018 negotiate the main principles of the uk’s future relationship with the eu as well as a transitional period brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising subscribers distributors and employees as described in item 1a risk factors below we continue to monitor the situation and plan for potential effects to our distribution and licensing agreements unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape 

education and other 

education and other generated revenues of  158 million  during 2017  which represented 2  of our total consolidated revenues education is comprised of curriculumbased product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculumbased vod tools professional development services digital textbooks and to a lesser extent student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculumbased content other is comprised of our whollyowned production studio which provides services to our us networks and international networks segments at cost 

on february 26 2018  the company announced the planned sale of a controlling equity stake in its education business in the first half of 2018 to   francisco partners for cash of 120 million  no loss is expected upon sale the company will retain an equity interest additionally the company will have ongoing license agreements which are considered to be at fair value as of december 31 2017 the company determined that the education business did not meet the held for sale criteria as defined in gaap as management had not committed to a plan to sell the assets 

on april 28 2017  the company sold raw and betty to all3media all3media is a uk based television film and digital production and distribution company the company owns 50  of all3media and accounts for its investment in all3media under the equity method of accounting raw and betty were components of the studios operating segment reported with education and other 

on november 12 2015 we paid 195 million  to acquire 5 million  shares or approximately 3  of lions gate entertainment corp lionsgate an entertainment company involved in the production of movies and television which is accounted for as an availableforsale afs security during 2016  we determined that the decline in value of our investment in lionsgate is otherthantemporary in nature and as such the cost basis was adjusted to the fair value of the investment as of september 30 2016 see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and whollyowned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs production of digitalfirst content such as virtual reality and shortform video is typically done through whollyowned production studios coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because at times worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or 

series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks our nonfiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our nonfiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairment and production costs for programming we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of three  to four  years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded for content asset carrying value in excess of net realizable value 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite telecommunication and digital service providers and advertising sold on our networks and digital products other transactions include curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services production of content content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2017  distribution advertising and other revenues were 51  44  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenues no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2017  2016  or 2015  

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discoverys network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement and the market demand for the content that we provide from time to time renewals of multiyear carriage agreements include significant initial year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

in the us more than 90  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2018 through 2021  outside of the us approximately 42  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

advertising 

our advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing paytv markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to paytv in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or fta television environments 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of fta television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital products on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with curriculumbased products and services the licensing of our brands for consumer products and thirdparty content sales and content production from our production studios 

competition 

providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership there is competition from other production studios other television networks and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors in certain instances internet competitors have been able to acquire content at more competitive prices since content ownership may benefit their business in other ways our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our content viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and digital products compete with other television networks including broadcast cable local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our education business competes with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the eu in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against content networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of content our content and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material the 21 st  century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain ipdelivered video content that we offer 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

violent programming 

in 2007 the fcc issued a report on violence in programing that recommended congress prohibit the availability of violent programming including cable programming during hours when children are likely to be watching recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of congress in the alleged effects of violent programming which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several digital products and websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

risks related to our business 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings likewise distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as “skinny bundles” which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks that are gaining popularity among consumers if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle in 2017 total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 5 while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3 for the same period each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 90  of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors for the international networks segment approximately 42  of distribution revenue comes from the 10  largest distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in us networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2021 some of our largest distributors have combined and as a result have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024 we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable we could see low viewership which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues 

the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

as a company that has operations in the united kingdom the vote by the united kingdom to leave the eu could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial position 

  

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government has begun negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make 

our doing business in europe more difficult which could delay and reduce the scope our distribution and licensing agreements without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the uk or distribute our services in europe in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for workrelated matters 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming our systems may be breached due to employee error malicious code hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

our equity method and cost method investments financial performance may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for using the cost method if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value 

risks related to the scripps networks acquisition 

we may not be able to successfully integrate the scripps networks business with our own realize the anticipated benefits of the scripps networks acquisition or manage our expanded operations any of which would adversely affect our results of operations 

we have devoted and expect to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our organization procedures and operations with those of scripps networks such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes policies procedures locations operations technologies and systems to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales service operations payroll pricing marketing and employee benefits integration expenses could particularly in the short term exceed the cost synergies we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 following the merger the size and complexity of the business of the combined company will increase significantly our future success depends in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger 

dcl was not obligated to place in escrow the net proceeds of its senior notes that were issued in september 2017 partially to fund the scripps networks acquisition the “senior notes” and as a result we may not be able to redeem the senior notes upon a special mandatory redemption 

under the terms of the senior notes we are obligated to redeem the senior notes at a redemption price of 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if the scripps acquisition does not close by august 18 2018 a “special mandatory redemption” we were not obligated to place the net proceeds of the offering of the senior notes in escrow prior to the completion of the scripps networks acquisition or to provide a security interest in those proceeds and the indenture governing the senior notes imposes no other restrictions on our use of these proceeds during that time accordingly the source of funds for any redemption of the 500 million principal amount of 2200 senior notes due 2019 120 billion principal amount of 2950 senior notes due 2023 170 billion principal amount of 3950 senior notes due 2028 125 billion principal amount of 5000 senior notes due 

2037 and 125 billion principal amount of 5200 senior notes due 2047 or £400 million principal amount of 2500 senior notes due 2024 upon a special mandatory redemption would be the proceeds that we have voluntarily retained or other sources of liquidity including available cash borrowings sales of assets or sales of equity we may not be able to satisfy our obligation to redeem these senior notes upon a special mandatory redemption because we may not have sufficient financial resources to pay the aggregate redemption price on such senior notes our failure to redeem these senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture which could result in defaults under our and our subsidiaries’ other debt agreements and have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes in addition our ability to redeem the senior notes for cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time 

general risks 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

             events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects 

          furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are 

distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction 

from time to time we make acquisitions investments and enter into other strategic transactions including our planned transaction with scripps networks in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions we may incur unanticipated expenses fail to realize anticipated benefits have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses disrupt relationships with current and new employees subscribers affiliates and vendors incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions such as the scripps networks transaction additionally regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 



 our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities our success after the scripps networks acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees prior to and following the completion of the merger current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities which could have an adverse effect on discovery after the transaction if key employees depart the integration of scripps networks with discovery may be more difficult and our business following the completion of the merger may be adversely affected additionally we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

newlyenacted us tax reform could adversely impact our international business and results of operations 

recently   enacted us tax reform could adversely impact our business and results of operations on december 22 2017 president trump signed the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja which includes a broad range of tax reform regulations affecting businesses including corporate tax rates business deductions and international tax provisions some of the changes like the new tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti or the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes and our overall tax liability and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

risks related to our debt 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 148 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our 25 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

risks related to corporate structure 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject under the tcja we are subject to us taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” and liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global liberty interactive and liberty broadband together the liberty entities own interests in 

various us and international companies such as charter communications inc charter that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our elevenperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of liberty interactive two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of charter of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest john c malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities and is a member of the board of directors of charter the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a1 convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a1 convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 24  of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a1 convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 47  of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 26  of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 39  of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive shares representing approximately 46 of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21  of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 28  of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own stock and stock incentives of the liberty entities and own our stock and stock incentives 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 



 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s series a1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine share of our series a common stock and advancenewhouse’s series c1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 193648  shares of our series c common stock subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of 

possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders

nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution distribution revenue increased   8  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations distribution revenue increased 7  us networks distribution revenue increases were driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in svod revenue partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers total us networks portfolio subscribers declined 5  for the year ended december 31 2017  while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3  for the same period international networks distribution revenue increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in europe following further investment in sports content and to a lesser extent increases in latin america due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements these increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in asia 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels market demand the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory advertising revenue increased   3  in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase for our us networks was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our go platform partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines international networks increases were primarily due to increased volume across key markets in europe particularly southern europe and germany and latin america the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia 

other revenue increased 4  compared with the prior year primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the vten joint venture during the third quarter of the current year see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues increased   9  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction costs of revenues increased   7  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on content at our international networks segment particularly sports rights and associated production costs content amortization was 19 billion  and 17 billion  for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees selling general and administrative expenses increased   5  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations own and ten acquisitions selling general and administrative expenses increased   3  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily due to transaction costs for the scripps networks acquisition and integration costs of 79 million  including the 35 million  charge associated with the modification of advancenewhouses preferred stock see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill 

goodwill impairment expense of  13 billion  was recognized during the year ended december 31 2017  see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets depreciation and amortization was consistent for the year ended december 31 2017  compared with the prior period as capital spending has remained consistent over the periods 

restructuring and other charge s 

restructuring and other charges increased 17 million  the increase was primarily due to higher personnelrelated termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss gain on disposition 

the change in loss gain on disposition was 67 million  we recorded a 4 million  loss for the year ended december 31 2017  due to the sale of the raw and betty production studios on april 28 2017  compared with a gain of 63 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the gain on disposition recorded for the year ended december 31 2016  is comprised of the 50 million  gain for the deconsolidation of our digital networks business seeker and sourcefed studios in connection with the group nine transaction and the 13 million  gain due to the disposition of our radio businesses in the nordics see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 122 million  for the year ended december 31 2017   primarily due to costs incurred for the unsecured bridge loan commitment as well as interest accrued on the senior notes issued on september 21 2017  for the financing of the anticipated scripps networks acquisition see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

on march 13 2017 we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 650 million  and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of 600 million  of combined aggregate principal amount of our thenoutstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13 2017  as a result we recognized a 54 million  loss on extinguishment of debt which included 50 million  for premiums to par value 2 million  of noncash writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs 1 million  for the writeoff of the original issue discount of the existing senior notes and 1 million  accrued for other thirdparty fees see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss from equity investees net 

losses from our equity method investees increased 173 million  primarily due to losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy partially offset by increases in earnings at own and decreases in losses at all3media see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

other expense income net 

the table below presents the details of other expense net in millions 



other expense increased 114 million  in 2017  we recorded foreign currency losses during 2017 compared to foreign currency gains during 2016 mostly due to exchange rate changes on the us dollar compared with the british pound that impacted foreign currency monetary assets increases in losses from derivative instruments primarily resulted from losses of 98 million  on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollardenominated senior notes which were settled on september 21 2017  the interest rate contracts did not receive hedging designation the losses were partially offset by various other items including a gain of 17 million  on previously settled interest rate contracts for which the hedged issuance of debt is considered remote following the issuance of the senior notes on september 21 2017  see note 9 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements on november 30 2017 the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own we recognized a remeasurement gain to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 4950 equity interest see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

income taxes

income tax expense was 176 million  and 453 million  and our effective tax rate was 128  and 27  for 2017  and 2016  respectively during 2017 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of noncash goodwill impairment charges that are nondeductible for tax purposes thereafter the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to investment tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments and to a lesser extent the domestic production activity deduction benefit the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions and the impact of the 2017 tax act see note 16 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements the benefits were partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2017 in 2016 we favorably resolved multiyear state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions that did not recur in 2017 

segment results of operations – 2017  vs 2016

items impacting comparability 

from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods in comparing the financial results for the years 2017  and 2016  the company has identified foreign currency as one such item as noted below the company also has various acquisitions and dispositions that impact the comparability of our results to the extent that the transaction materially impacts a particular item or segment it may be discussed in the relevant section above see note 3 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements 

foreign currency 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2016 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below in millions results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

other income expense net increased 101 million in 2016 the change is primarily the result of gains in foreign currency offset by a 62 million otherthantemporary impairment in the value of our lionsgate shares see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the change in foreign currency gains losses net is caused by the remeasurement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016 exchange rate changes in the british pound resulted in net remeasurement gains the gains in the current year are in contrast to losses in the prior period for the remeasurement of our 190 eurodominated senior notes due march 19 2027 which have been effectively hedged for the year ended december 31 2016  and remeasurement losses on monetary assets in venezuela following a steep decline in value during the prior year 

income taxes 

the following table reconciles the companys effective income tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate 



income tax expense was 453 million and 511 million and the effective tax rate was 27 and 33 for 2016 and 2015 respectively the net 6 decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the resolution of multiyear state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions the impact of various foreign legislative changes and tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments the decrease was partially offset by 2015 favorable audit resolutions which positively impacted the assessment of uncertain tax positions for 2015 but did not recur in 2016 see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

items impacting comparability 

from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods in comparing the financial results for the years 2016  and 2015  the company has identified foreign currency and the impact of the acquisition of eurosport as items impacting comparability between periods as noted below 

foreign currency 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful 

information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2015 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2015 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below in millions results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

we repay our senior notes term loans revolving credit facility and commercial paper as required and accordingly these sources of cash also require use of our cash 

 we elected to settle our outstanding prepaid common stock repurchase contract in cash during the twelve months ended december 31 2017  resulting in the receipt of 58 million  the cash received was inclusive of a 1 million  premium over the 57 million upfront cash payment made in 2016  and was determined by the market price of our series c common stock during the settlement period in march 2017  see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

scripps networks shareholders will receive 6300  per share in cash and a number of shares of discoverys series c common stock that is determined in accordance with a formula and subject to a collar based on the volume weighted average price of the companys series c common stock the formula is based on the volume weighted average price of discoverys series c common stock over the 15 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to closing the “average discovery price” scripps networks shareholders will receive 12096  shares of discoverys series c common stock if the average discovery price is below 2232  and 09408  shares of discoverys series c common stock if the average discovery price is above 2870  the intent of the range was to provide scripps networks shareholders with 2700  of value per share in discovery series c common stock if the average discovery price is greater than or equal to 2232  but less than or equal to 2870  scripps networks shareholders will receive a proportional number of shares between 12096  and 09408  if the average discovery price is below 2551  discovery has the option to pay additional cash instead of issuing more shares above the 10584  conversation ratio required at 2551  the cash payment is equal to the product of the additional shares required under the collar formula multiplied by the average discovery price for example if the average discovery price were 2232  with a conversion ratio of 12096  the company could offer shares at the 10584  ratio and pay for the difference associated with the incremental 

shares in cash outstanding employee equity awards or sharebased awards that vest upon the change of control will be acquired with a similar combination of cash and shares of discovery series c common stock pursuant to terms specified in the merger agreement therefore the merger consideration will fluctuate based upon changes in the share price of discovery series c common stock and the number of scripps networks common shares stock options and other equitybased awards outstanding on the closing date discovery will also pay certain transaction costs incurred by scripps networks the postclosing impact of the formula was intended to result in scripps networks’ shareholders owning approximately 20  of discovery’s fully diluted common shares and discovery’s shareholders owning approximately 80  the company will utilize previously issued debt proceeds see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and cash on hand to finance the cash portion of the transaction the transaction is subject to approvals and other customary closing conditions

cash flows 

changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows in millions 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 249 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to a  253 million  decrease in cash paid for taxes the decrease in cash paid for taxes net for the year ended december 31 2017  is mostly due to the tax impact from the companys investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy see note 4 and note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements declines in working capital primarily due to changes in accounts receivable were offset by a decrease in the net negative effect of foreign currency and increases in payables   

cash provided by operating activities increased 96 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  improvements in operating results were partially offset by increases in content spending particularly for sports rights of 131 million  and the impact of foreign currency 

investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities increased 377 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was mostly attributable to an increase in payments for investments of 172 million  including renewable energy projects and payments for derivative instruments of 98 million  that did not receive hedge accounting but economically hedged pricing risk for the senior notes issued september 21 2017 

cash flows used in investing activities decreased 45 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for business combinations net of cash acquired of 80 million  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of businesses of 42 million  

financing activities 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased 71 billion  for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which will be used to finance the scripps networks acquisition see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and a decrease in repurchases of stock of 771 million  offset by an increase in principal repayments of debt 

cash flows used in financing activities increased 265 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the increase was attributable to an increase in repurchases of stock of 423 million  and a decrease in net borrowings of 471 million  which is comprised of increases in repayments under our revolving credit facility net of repayments of 973 million  partially offset by increased borrowings of senior notes net of repayments of 411 million  and decreases in commercial paper repayments of 91 million  these net increases were partially offset by decreases in purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests of 548 million  and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of interest rate contracts of 69 million  

capital resources 

as of december 31 2017  capital resources were comprised of the following in millions 

  





a interest on our senior notes is paid annually semiannually or quarterly our senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2017  had interest rates that ranged from 190 to 635 and will mature between 2019 and 2047 

we expect that our cash balance cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months including any potential required payments related to the special mandatory redemption provision associated with certain senior notes issued on september 21 2017 our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 

as of december 31 2017  we held 103 million  of our 73 billion  of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries the 2017 tax act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings notwithstanding the us taxation of these amounts we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the us our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the us however if these funds are needed in the us we would be required to accrue and pay foreign taxes to repatriate them the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable 

additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2017  we had access to a 25 billion  revolving credit facility with outstanding borrowings of 425 million  as of december 31 2017  we also have access to a commercial paper program and had no  outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2017  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt the revolving credit facility provides for a maturity date of august 11 2022  and the option for up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding debt with a book value of 139 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates and 400 million  with a floating interest rate 

the company has entered into a three year delayed draw tranche and a five year delayed draw tranche unsecured term loan credit facility each with a principal amount of up to 1 billion  the term loans interest rates are based at the companys option on either adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin the company will pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points per annum for each loan based on its current credit rating beginning september 28 2017 until either the funding of the loans or the termination of the scripps networks acquisition as of december 31 2017 the company has not yet borrowed on the term loan credit facilities 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings 

to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid as of december 31 2017  we have no outstanding interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2017  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 148 billion  the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 13 billion  as of december 31 2017  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings our international networks segment operates from the following hubs emea latin america and asia cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net loss income other comprehensive income and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

 the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro and the british pound we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments intended to hedge future cash flows held at december 31 2017  was a liability value of 5 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2017  we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and the fair value of investments classified as afs securities we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method cost method afs securities and other highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees cost method investees afs securities and mutual funds were 335 million  295 million  164 million  and 29 billion  respectively at december 31 2017  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future during 2017 the company issued 68 billion  in senior notes to partially fund the scripps networks acquisition see note 3 and note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of these total proceeds 27 billion  were invested in money market funds 13 billion  were invested in time deposit accounts and the remainder was invested in highly liquid shortterm instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less 

these investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and are anticipated to be used for the scripps networks acquisition in the interim the company has full access to these proceeds

new accounting and reporting pronouncements 

we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2017  information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 with respect to our accounting policy for goodwill we further supplement disclosures in note 2 with the following 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments the component level reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are as follows us networks europe latin america asia and education 

we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization the impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit if a quantitative test is performed if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is not required 

consistent with our accounting policy the company performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test comparison of fair value to carrying value for each of its reporting units in 2016  which indicated limited headroom the excess of fair value over carrying value in the european reporting unit of 12  while all other reporting units had headroom in excess of 40  given the limited headroom in the european reporting unit the company closely monitored its results during 2017  and again performed a quantitative impairment test of the european reporting unit as of november 30 2017  which indicated a slight failure approximately 100 million  or 3  deficit the key factors resulting in the impairment include 1 moderated revenue expectations based on continued declines in viewership 2 expected increases in content investment to service existing customers and grow the companys directtoconsumer business and 3 lower stock price multiples for peer media companies given the results of the step 1 impairment test the company applied the hypothetical purchase price analysis required by the step 2 test and recognized a pretax goodwill impairment charge of 13 billion  as of november 30 2017  for the european reporting unit the impairment charge of 13 billion  significantly exceeds the deficit of fair value to carrying value of approximately 100 million  because of significant intangible assets that are not recognized on our balance sheet ie excluded from book carrying value but are considered in the step 2 calculation on a fair value basis the step 1 and step 2 tests and relevant assumptions are further discussed below for our us networks latin asia and education reporting units we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment review in 2017 no factors were identified indicating a need for a quantitative assessment 

for the 2017 step 1 test the carrying value of the european reporting unit of 40 billion  which includes 24 billion  of goodwill exceeded its fair value of 39 billion  by 3  in performing the step 1 test we determined the fair value of our european reporting unit by using a combination of discounted cash flow “dcf” analyses and marketbased valuation methodologies the results of these valuation methodologies were weighted 75  towards the dcf and 25  towards the marketbased approach which 

is consistent with prior quantitative analyses significant judgments and assumptions used in the dcf and marketbased model to assess the reporting units fair value include the amount and timing of expected future cash flows longterm growth rates of 25  compared with 3  in 2016  a discount rate of 975  compared with 105  in 2016  and our selection of guideline company earnings multiples of 75  compared with 95  in 2016 the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for the european reporting unit are based on the reporting units budget and longterm business plan which reflect our expectations based upon recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a dcf analysis actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

the net assets assigned to the european reporting unit included corporate allocations these assets and liabilities include corporate enterprise goodwill and intangible assets allocated in prior periods based on the relative fair value of the european reporting unit at the time and deferred taxes and content allocated based on whether or not the jurisdiction gave rise to the deferred tax balance or is using the content asset 

in the second step of the impairment test we hypothetically assigned the european reporting units fair value to its individual assets and liabilities including significant unrecognized intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names or liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination since the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill was less than the carrying value the difference was recorded as an impairment charge the fair value estimates incorporated in step 2 for the hypothetical intangible assets were based on the excess earnings income approach for customer relationships the relieffromroyalty method for trademarks and the greenfield approach for broadcast licenses key judgments made by management in step 2   of the impairment test included revenue growth rates length of contract term number of renewals customer attrition rates marketbased royalty rates and market based tax rates the valuation of advertising relationships assumed an attrition rate of 10  affiliate relationships assumed three contract renewals each with a four year term per customer and trade names assumed royalty rates ranging from 2  to 5  other assumptions used in these hypothetical calculations had a less significant impact on the concluded fair value or were subject to less significant estimation or judgment none of these hypothetical calculations for unrecorded intangibles were recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

as of the goodwill testing date the carrying value of remaining goodwill assigned to the european reporting unit was 11 billion  and the net assets of the reporting unit were approximately 27 billion  which results in headroom based on the estimated fair value of 39 billion  

see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k for the key factors underlying these charges 

management will continue to monitor reporting units for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities see item 1a risk factors for details on all significant risks that could impact the companys ability to successfully grow its cash flows 

for an in depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

 us networks 

us networks generated revenues of  33 billion  and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization adjusted oibda of 19 billion  during 2016  which represented 51  and 79  of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our us networks segment principally consists of national television networks our us networks segment owns and operates ten national television networks including fully distributed television networks such as discovery channel tlc and animal planet in addition this segment holds an equity method interest in own oprah winfrey network own 

us networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our television networks’ first run content which include cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers referred to as affiliate fees fees from digital distributors for licensed content that was previously distributed on our television networks referred to as digital distribution revenue fees from advertising sold on our television networks and digital products which include our go suite of applications and our virtual reality product discovery vr fees from providing sales representation and network distribution services and content to equity method investee networks and revenue from licensing our brands for consumer products 

typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and for annual graduated rate increases carriage of our networks depends on package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages also referred to as digital tiers we provide authenticated us tv everywhere products that are available to certain subscribers and connect viewers through go applications with live and ondemand access to awardwinning shows and series from nine us networks in the discovery portfolio discovery channel tlc animal planet id science channel velocity destination america american heroes channel ahc and discovery life 

advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels and leverage multiple platforms to connect advertisers to target audiences in the us advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and by committing to purchase in advance lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce purchase commitments in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates the mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time that upfront sales take place impacting the sellout levels management is willing or able to obtain the demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile

accompanying consolidated financial statements we will account for the investment under the cost method see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks in the us that utilize the following brands 

 

 

 

 

 

international networks 

international networks generated revenues of 30 billion  and adjusted oibda of 848 million  during 2016  which represented 47  and 35  of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our international networks segment principally consists of national and panregional television networks and brands that are delivered across multiple distribution platforms this segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every paytv market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london warsaw milan singapore and miami global brands include discovery channel animal planet tlc id science channel and turbo known as velocity in the us along with brands exclusive to international networks including eurosport real time dmax and discovery kids as of december 31 2016  international networks operated over 400  unique distribution feeds in over 40  languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities international networks also has fta and broadcast networks in europe and the middle east and broadcast networks in germany norway and sweden and continues to pursue further international expansion fta networks generate a significant portion of international networks revenue the penetration and growth rates of television services vary across countries and territories depending on numerous factors including the dominance of different television platforms in local markets while paytv services have greater penetration in certain markets fta or broadcast television is dominant in others international networks has a large international distribution platform for its 37  networks with as many as 13  networks distributed in any particular country or territory across the more than 220  countries and territories around the world international networks pursues distribution across all television platforms based on the specific dynamics of local markets and relevant commercial agreements in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks internationally that utilize the following brands 

 



 

our international networks segment also owns and operates the following regional television networks which reached the following number of subscribers and viewers via pay and fta or broadcast networks respectively as of december 31 2016    





a number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the nordic broadcast networks in sweden norway finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with paytv providers the nordic broadcast networks include kanal 5 kanal 9 and kanal 11 in sweden tv norge max fem and vox in norway tv 5 kutonen and frii in finland and kanal 4 kanal 5 6eren and canal 9 in denmark 

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and fta television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets in developing television markets advertising revenue growth results from continued subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from traditional broadcast networks to channels 

in the multichannel environment in relatively mature markets such as northern europe growth in television advertising revenue comes from increasing advertising pricing and ratings on our existing television networks 

during 2016  distribution advertising and other revenues were 55  42  and 2  respectively of total net revenues for this segment while the company has traditionally operated cable networks in recent years an increasing portion of the companys international advertising revenue is generated by fta or broadcast networks unlike us networks during 2016  paytv networks generated 46  of international networks advertising revenue and fta or broadcast networks generated 54  of international networks advertising revenue 

the companys international networks distribute content through localized programming disseminated via more than 400  unique distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from us networks we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from third parties international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion of current estimated revenues relative to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the content of up to five years content acquired from us networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly as amortization rates vary by network a portion of international networks content is amortized using an accelerated amortization method while the remainder is amortized on a straightline basis the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each component of the arrangement

on february 28 2014 we acquired raw tv limited a factual entertainment production company in the uk to improve the sourcing of content for our networks see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and whollyowned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs production of digitalfirst content such as virtual reality and shortform video is typically done through whollyowned production studios coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because at times worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks our nonfiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our nonfiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairment and production costs for languaging we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of three  to four  years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded for content asset carrying value in excess of net realizable value 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite telecommunication and digital service providers and advertising sold on our networks and digital products other transactions include curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services production of content content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2016  distribution advertising and other revenues were 50  45  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenues no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2016  2015  or 2014  

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discoverys network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement and the market demand for the content that we provide from time to time renewals of multiyear carriage agreements include significant initial year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

in the us more than 90  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2017 through 2021  outside of the us approximately 46  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

advertising 

our advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing paytv markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to paytv in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or fta television environments 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of fta television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital products on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with curriculumbased products and services the licensing of our brands for consumer products and thirdparty content sales and content production from our production studios 

competition 

providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership there is competition from other production studios other television networks and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our content viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and digital products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local networks online and mobile outlets radio content and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and digital products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business competes with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the eu in which we 

operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against content networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of content our content and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material the 21 st  century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain ipdelivered video content that we offer 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

violent programming 

in 2007 the fcc issued a report on violence in programing that recommended congress prohibit the availability of violent programming including cable programming during hours when children are likely to be watching recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of congress in the alleged effects of violent programming which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several digital products and websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions 

including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

foreign laws and regulations 

the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 7000  employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our whollyowned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings digital downloads rights lockers rentals and subscription services are competing for consumer preferences with each other and with traditional physical distribution of dvds and bluray discs each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 90  of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors for the international networks segment approximately 46  of distribution revenue comes from the 10  largest 

distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in us networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2021 some of our largest distributors have combined and as a result have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming our systems may be breached due to employee error computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the broad and diverse market of free and subscription internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business and digital textbook business compete with other providers of education products to schools the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these 

affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

             events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects 

          furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

as a company that has operations in the united kingdom the vote by the united kingdom to leave the eu could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial position 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could delay and reduce the scope our distribution and licensing agreements without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the uk or distribute our services in europe in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for work related matters 

the announcement of brexit has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations with the expansion of our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation has increased this increase in exposure could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances as there can be no assurance that the downward trend of the british pound and the euro will rebound brexit may also create global uncertainty which may cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending these decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions where our networks are distributed this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming which could in turn have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues a decrease in our viewing subscribers would have a negative impact on the number of viewers watching our programming possibly impacting the rates we are able to charge for advertising any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial position 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other content services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be 

affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 

 our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our equity method and cost method investments financial performance may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in certain entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for using the cost method if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 79 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject we are required to accrue and pay us taxes for repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” and liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global liberty interactive and liberty broadband together the liberty entities own interests in various us and international companies such as charter communications inc charter that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our elevenperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty interactive two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of charter of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest john c malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities and is a member of the board of directors at charter the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 25  of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 47  of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 24  of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 37  of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive shares representing approximately 46 of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing 

approximately 21  of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 28  of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own stock and stock incentives of the liberty entities and own our stock and stock incentives 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 



we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s series a convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into one share of our series a common stock and one share of our series c common stock and advancenewhouse’s series c convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of our series c common stock on a 2for1 basis subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock

costs of revenues increased   4  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015 and the disposition of the companys radio business costs of revenues increased   7  for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for content on our networks particularly sports rights and associated production costs and increases in content impairments in northern europe as a result of changes in programming strategies content amortization was 17 billion  and 16 billion  for the years ended december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively

restructuring and other charge s 

restructuring and other charges increased 8 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was primarily due to personnel related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions in the second quarter of 2016 see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements this increase was partially offset by decreases in content impairments that were classified as other charges 

gain on disposition 

gain on disposition increased 80 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as a result of a gain recorded upon the deconsolidation of our digital networks businesses seeker and sourcefed studios on december 2 2016  in connection with the group nine media transaction and the recognition of a gain following the resolution of the final contingent payment for the sale of the radio business compared with an expected loss in the prior year see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

income tax expense was 453 million  and 511 million  and the effective tax rate was 27  and 33  for 2016  and 2015  respectively the net 6  decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the resolution of multiyear state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions the impact of various foreign legislative changes and tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments the decrease was partially offset by 2015 favorable audit resolutions which positively impacted the assessment of uncertain tax positions for 2015 but did not recur in 2016 see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

revenues 

distribution revenue increased   3  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015 distribution revenue increased   9  the increase was mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america such growth is consistent with the value negotiated in new arrangements following investment in sports content in markets in europe and the continued development of the paytv markets in latin america 

advertising revenue decreased   5  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the companys radio business advertising revenue increased   3  the increase was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe and to a lesser extent pricing ratings and volume in ceemea partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe and lower price ratings and volume in asia 

other revenue decreased   22  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the companys radio business other revenue decreased   17  due to a reduction in sublicensing revenue for eurosport

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management administrative support services and substantially all of our equitybased compensation 

adjusted oibda remained consistent with the prior period 

the increase in marktomarket equitybased compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in discoverys stock price in 2016  compared to 2015  changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights sars and performancebased restricted stock units prsus by contrast stock options and servicebased restricted stock units rsus are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without marktomarket adjustments the expense associated with stock options and rsus is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling general and administrative expense 

items impacting comparability 

from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods in comparing the financial results for the years 2016  and 2015  the company has identified foreign currency as one such item as noted below 

foreign currency 

the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results for example our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis exfx in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation exfx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

the exfx change represents the percentage change on a periodoverperiod basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts the exfx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process the “2016 baseline rate” and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 baseline rate in addition consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment our exfx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below in millions results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 





results of operations – 2015  vs 2014   

the discussion of our results that follows reflects our management reporting structure for international networks prior to january 1 2015 effective january 1 2015 we realigned our international networks management reporting structure into the following regions northern europe which includes primarily the nordic countries which we refer to as the nordics and uk southern europe which primarily includes italy and spain ceemea which has been expanded to include germany latin america asiapacific and eurosport previously international networks’ regional operations reporting structure was segregated into the following regions western europe which included the uk and western european countries nordics ceemea latin america asiapacific and eurosport this realignment did not impact our consolidated financial statements other than to change the regions in which we describe our operating results for the international networks segment from january 1 2015

revenues 

distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport and the effect of the consolidation of discovery family distribution revenue increased 7 as a result of increases of 7 at our us networks segment and 7 at our international networks segment for us networks excluding the effect of the consolidation of discovery family distribution revenue increased primarily due to annual contractual rate increases and to a lesser extent increases in digital distribution revenue partially offset by slight declines in subscribers the increase in our international networks distribution revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency and the acquisition of eurosport was mostly due to increases in affiliate rates and subscribers in equivalent amounts in latin america and a lesser extent to increases in subscribers in ceemea and digital distribution revenue 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels market demand the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets and economic conditions these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and the disposition of the companys radio business advertising revenue increased 6 primarily due to increases of 11 at our international networks segment and to a lesser extent increases of 2 at our us networks segment the increase at our international networks segment was mostly driven by pricing and to a lesser extent ratings in southern europe and pricing volume and to a lesser extent ratings in latin america southern europe and latin america contributed to the increase in equivalent amounts the increases were also to a lesser extent due to pricing in northern europe these increases were partially offset by decreases due to changes in regulations involving advertising sales operations in russia as further described in item 1 business in this annual report on form 10k us networks advertising revenue increased due to increases in pricing partially offset by lower audience delivery 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and the disposition of the companys radio business other revenue increased 4 this increase was primarily due to an increase at our education and other segments due to increased productions and to a lesser extent an increase at our international networks segment as result of increased program sales these increases were offset by a decrease at our us networks segment primarily due to the absence of representation service fees for discovery family which have been eliminated since the company began to consolidate discovery family 

costs of revenues 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisitions of eurosport the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and the disposition of the companys radio business costs of revenues increased 11 as result of increases of 12 at our international networks segment and 7 at our us networks segment the increases in costs of revenues were mostly due to our commitment to increased spending for content on our networks which increased content amortization and to a lesser extent increases in content impairments that were not included in restructuring and other charges excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport and the effect of the consolidation of discovery family content amortization was 15 billion and 13 billion for the years ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively content amortization rates on our networks have been slightly accelerating 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport the consolidation of discovery family and the disposition of the companys radio business selling general and administrative expenses increased 3 for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily due to an increase in selling general and administrative expense at our international networks segment of 10 mostly due to increased personnel and associated support costs and to a lesser extent increased marketing costs the increase was also to a lesser extent due to slight increases at our us network segment due to an increase in research and to a lesser extent marketing costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our equitybased compensation expense 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations business combinations and dispositions depreciation and amortization remained consistent for the year ended december 31 2015 

restructuring and other charge s 

restructuring and other charges decreased 40 million the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in content impairment resulting from the postacquisition rebranding of the hub network to discovery family in 2014 see note 6 and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

loss gain on disposition 

loss on dispositions comprised 12 million for the sale of the sbs radio business and 5 million for the contribution of the russian business to the new russian business for the year ended december 31 2015 gain on disposition comprised 31 million for the sale of howstuffworks for the year ended december 31 2014 see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense remained consistent for the year ended december 31 2015   as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  

income from equity investees net 

income from our equity method investees declined 22 million mostly due to losses at all3media related to the amortization of intangible assets for the step up in the fair value of assets acquired from the investment following its acquisition on september 23 2014 interest expense for the recapitalization of debt for the transaction and losses on derivative instruments the decline was also to a lesser extent due to the change in accounting for discovery family from an equity method investment to a consolidated subsidiary as well as decreased income at various other equity method investees 

other expense net 

  

          the table below presents the details of other income expense net in millions 



other expense net increased 88 million in 2015 the increase was primarily due to foreign currency losses related to revaluation of our 190 eurodominated senior notes due march 19 2027 which expose discovery to fluctuations in euro exchange rates as well as the revaluation of monetary assets in venezuela due to changes in the bolivar exchange rate used to remeasure revenue and monetary asset balances as further discussed in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form 10k the increase was further attributable to a decrease in remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in eurosport on may 30 2014 of 29 million and eurosport france on march 31 2015 of 2 million see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements these increases were slightly offset by the attribution expense related to the put right held by tf1 the holder of the remaining interests in eurosport and eurosport france as a component of other expense net in 2014 for which there is no similar expense in the 2015 

income taxes 

the following table reconciles the companys effective income tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate 



income tax expense was 511 million and 610 million and the effective tax rate was 33 and 35 for 2015 and 2014 respectively the net 2 decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of multiple audit resolutions and the lapse of the statute of limitations in foreign and domestic jurisdictions favorable impact to deferred taxes due to various enacted foreign legislative changes and the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions

we expect that our cash balance cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios

we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2016  information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 with respect to our accounting policy for goodwill we further supplement disclosures in note 2 with the following 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments the component level reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are as follows us networks europe latin america asiapacific education and studios 

we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is not required 

for 2016 we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units based on our policy of performing a quantitative impairment test every three years irrespective of the outcome of the qualitative assessment the quantitative impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit the first step of the test requires the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the first step we determined the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flow “dcf” analyses and marketbased valuation 

methodologies determining fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting units budget longterm business plan and recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a dcf analysis actual results may differ from those used in our valuations in assessing the reasonableness of the determined fair values we also reconciled the aggregate determined fair value of the company to the companys market capitalization which included a 14 control premium 

the net assets assigned to each of our reporting units included corporate allocations these assets and liabilities include corporate enterprise goodwill and intangible assets allocated to each reporting unit based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit at inception and deferred taxes and content allocated to each reporting unit based on the jurisdiction that gave rise to the deferred tax balance or is using the content asset 

for the current year test the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values by 12 to 83 headroom significant assumptions used in the dcf and marketbased models included exchange rates used in the long range plan lrp discount rates that ranged from 9 to 125 and guideline company earnings multiples and control premiums an increase in the discount and decrease in the longterm growth rates of 05 would result in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their respective carrying values by 5 to 82 

 the europe reporting unit which had headroom of 12 was the only reporting unit with fair value in excess of carrying value of less than 20 as of december 31 2016 the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the europe reporting unit was 22 billion management will continue to monitor this reporting unit for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability the recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities see item 1a risk factors for details on all significant risks that could impact the companys ability to successfully grow its cash flows most significantly changes in foreign exchange rates impact on the calculation of fair value in excess of carrying value for step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as the europe reporting unit operates in foreign markets with various functional currencies and has significant us dollar denominated assets a strengthening of the us dollar negatively impacts the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value 

for an in depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2016  we had access to a 20 billion  revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program with outstanding borrowings of 550 million  and 48 million  respectively as of december 31 2016  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt the revolving credit facility provides for a maturity date of february 4 2021 and the option for up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding debt with a book value of 72 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid as of december 31 2016  we have no outstanding interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2016  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 74 billion  the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 557 million  as of december 31 2016  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings through december 31 2016  our international networks segment is divided into the following five regions northern europe ceemea southern europe latin america and asiapacific cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income other comprehensive income and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

 the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the euro the british pound currencies in the nordics the japanese yen and the russian ruble we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments held at december 31 2016  was an asset value of 13 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures that were not hedged as of december 31 2016  we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and the fair value of investments classified as afs securities we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method cost method afs securities and other highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees cost method investees afs securities and mutual funds were 557 million  245 million  128 million  and 160 million  respectively at december 31 2016  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

our international networks segment also owns and operates the following regional television networks which reached the following number of subscribers and viewers via pay and freetoair or broadcast networks respectively as of december 31 2015    





a number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the sbs nordic broadcast networks in sweden norway finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with pay television providers 

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while 

others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and freetoair television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets in developing television markets we expect that advertising revenue growth will result from continued subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from traditional broadcast networks to channels in the multichannel environment in relatively mature markets such as western europe we anticipate that growth in advertising revenue will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing television networks launching new services and through acquisitions 

during 2015  distribution advertising and other revenues were 53  44  and 3  respectively of total net revenues for this segment while the company has traditionally operated cable networks an increasing portion of the companys international ad revenue is generated by freetoair or broadcast networks paytv networks and freetoair or broadcast networks which include the sbs networks generated 47  and 49  of international networks 2015  advertising revenue respectively radio networks generated 4  of international networks 2015  advertising revenue

         on october 7 2015  we recorded a pretax loss of 5 million  for the contribution of our russian business to a joint venture the “new russian business” with a russian media company national media group nmg we now hold a 20  interest in the new russian business which was established to comply with changes in russian legislation limiting foreign ownership we no longer consolidate the contributed russian business which was a component of our international networks operating segment and we will account for our ownership interest in the new russian business as an equity method investment see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

spain central and eastern europe the middle east and africa “ceemea” which has been expanded to include germany latin america asiapacific and eurosport previously international networks’ regional operations reporting structure was segregated into the following regions western europe which included the uk and western european countries nordics ceemea latin america asiapacific and eurosport this realignment did not impact our consolidated financial statements other than to change the regions in which we describe our operating results for the international networks segment 

education and other 

education and other generated revenues of  173 million  during 2015  which represented 3  of our total consolidated revenues education is comprised of curriculumbased product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculumbased vod tools professional development services digital textbooks and to a lesser extent student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculumbased content other is comprised of production studios that develop content for our networks and other television service providers throughout the world our wholly owned production studios provide services to our us networks and international networks segments at cost the revenues and offsetting expenses associated with these intersegment production services are not reflected in the results of operations for education and other as they have been eliminated within the production studios operating segment

on november 1 2013  we acquired an education business in the uk to complement our existing service offerings and expand our operations internationally see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

our production studios are an operating segment that has been combined with our education segment neither of these operating segments meet the quantitative thresholds for reporting as a separate reportable segment and are aggregated for reporting purposes to reconcile reporting segments to consolidated results 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and wholly owned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because at times worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairments and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the 

estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized primarily over periods of three  to four  years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded for content asset carrying value in excess of net realizable value 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite telecommunication and digital service providers and advertising sold on our networks and websites other transactions include curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services production of content content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2015  distribution advertising and other revenues were 48  47  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenues no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2015  2014  or 2013  

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discoverys network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

in the us approximately 95  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2016 through 2021  outside of the us approximately 45  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution agreements are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

advertising 

our advertising revenue consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in paytv broadcast or freetoair television environments 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of freetoair television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth 

quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our websites on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with curriculumbased products and services the licensing of our brands for consumer products and thirdparty content sales and content production from our production studios 

competition 

providing television content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership our networks compete with other production studios other television networks and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our networks viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our network content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local networks online and mobile outlets radio content and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business competes with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which 

encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the european union in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against content networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of content our content and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material the 21 st  century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain ipdelivered video content that we offer 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

violent programming 

in 2007 the fcc issued a report on violence in programing that recommended congress prohibit the availability of violent programming including cable programming during hours when children are likely to be watching recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of congress in the alleged effects of violent programming which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and 

security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

foreign laws and regulations 

the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 7000  employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 95  of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times through 2021 some of our largest distributors are combining and have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings digital downloads rights lockers rentals and subscription services are competing for consumer preferences with each other and with traditional physical distribution of dvds and bluray discs each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming our systems may be breached due to employee error computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the broad and diverse market of free and subscription internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business and digital textbook business compete with other providers of education products to schools the ability for our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

             events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects 

          furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive 

substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt or interpret in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other content services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the us from local currencies into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past and we expect to make additional 

acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 

 our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our equity method investments financial performance may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in certain entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 77 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 21 

 our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject we are required to accrue and pay us taxes for repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” and liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global liberty interactive and liberty broadband together the liberty entities own interests in various us and international companies that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse programming partnership advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our tenperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty interactive and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband john c malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 25  of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 47  of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 25  of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 36  of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive shares representing approximately 46 of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21  of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 29  of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our seven common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own stock and stock incentives of the liberty entities and own our stock and stock incentives 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or advancenewhouse andor one or more of the liberty entities on the other hand look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s series a convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into one share of our series a common stock and one share of our series c common stock and 

advancenewhouse’s series c convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of our series c common stock on a 2for1 basis subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders 

for corporate matters other than the election of directors mr malone and advancenewhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 21  and 25  respectively of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock with respect to the election of directors mr malone controls approximately 29  of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the seven common stock directors assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse the “an preferred stock” has not been converted into shares of our common stock the an preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board subject to certain conditions but does not carry voting rights with respect to the election of the seven common stock directors also under the terms of the an preferred stock advancenewhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws fundamental changes in our business mergers and other business combinations certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock although there is no stockholder agreement voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr malone and advancenewhouse by virtue of their respective holdings mr malone and advancenewhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations the acquisition of eurosport the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and the disposition of the companys radio business other revenue increased 4  this increase was primarily due to an increase at our education and other segments due to increased productions and to a lesser extent an increase at our international networks segment as result of increased program sales these increases were offset by a decrease at our us networks segment primarily due to the absence of representation service fees for discovery family which have been eliminated since the company began to consolidate discovery family

other expense net increased 88 million  in 2015 the increase was primarily due to foreign currency losses related to revaluation of our 190 eurodominated senior notes due march 19 2027 which expose discovery to fluctuations in euro exchange rates as well as the revaluation of monetary assets in venezuela due to changes in the bolivar exchange rate used to remeasure revenue and monetary asset balances as further discussed in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form 10k the increase was further attributable to a decrease in remeasurement gain related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in eurosport on may 30 2014 of 29 million  and eurosport france on march 31 2015 of 2 million  see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements these increases were slightly offset by the attribution expense related to the put right held by tf1 the holder of the remaining interests in eurosport and eurosport france as a component of other expense net in 2014 for which there is no similar expense in the 2015

cash flows used in investing activities decreased 14 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in cash paid for business combinations of 15 billion  net of cash acquired see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and a decrease in realized losses for derivatives used to economically hedge business combinations of 55 million see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements partially offset by an increase in investments in and advances to unconsolidated equity method investees of 149 million  for the investment in a 50 ownership interest in all3media a production studio company during 2014 see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

financing activities 

cash flows used in financing activities increased 168 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the increase was primarily due to the purchase of tf1s 49  noncontrolling interest in eurosport for 548 million  an increase in net repayments of commercial paper of 365 million  an increase in cash distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests of 40 million  and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of our interest rate contracts of 29 million  see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements these increases were partially offset by increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility of 318 million  and a decrease in the repurchases of stock of 471 million  

cash flows used in financing activities increased 649 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the increase in cash used was primarily due to a reduction in the proceeds from borrowings on an aggregated net basis from senior notes commercial paper and the revolving credit facility of 516 million during 2014 as compared to 2013 as well as an increase in share repurchases of 117 million  

capital resources 

as of december 31 2015  capital resources were comprised of the following in millions 

  





a outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 93 million  as of december 31 2015  are supported by unused committed capacity under the revolving credit facility and reduce unused capacity there were 782 million  in borrowings under the revolving credit facility outstanding as of december 31 2015  

b interest on senior notes is paid annually or semiannually our senior notes outstanding as of december 31 2015  had interest rates that ranged from 190 to 635 and will mature between 2019 and 2043 

we expect that our cash balance cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 

as of december 31 2015  we held 95 million  of our 390 million  of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the us however if these funds are needed in the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate them the determination of the amount of unrecognized us deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to reporting our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 55 

 with respect to our goodwill accounting policy we clarify the following 

goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management for goodwill impairment testing purposes we aggregate certain components or reporting units based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances including the nature of products and services the nature of production processes the extent of shared assets and resources and similar financial performance the extent of economic similarities between reporting units impacts the aggregation of these components into a reporting unit we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of november 30 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions industry trends costs cash flows or ongoing declines in market capitalization if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount a quantitative impairment test is not required prior to the aggregation of certain reporting units in 2015 our reporting units were as follows us networks northern europe southern europe ceemea eurosport latin america asiapacific education raw betty and us studios 

during 2015 we determined that our northern europe southern europe ceemea and eurosport reporting units met the aggregation criteria and we aggregated them into one reporting unit europe in the aggregation assessment we considered various factors including the nature of the components operations and the extent to which the components share assets in 2015 there were significant operational and backoffice integration activities with respect to recently acquired businesses such as eurosport and sbs nordic as well as changes in management reporting european components share content and uplink facilities as well as certain management personnel and backoffice support functions investment in research and development projects and the investment in the paneuropean olympics rights deal support the growth of all european components recently acquired businesses have been integrated into the european advertising and affiliate sales functions which determine the selling strategies and revenue growth of the european businesses in the aggregate we performed a goodwill impairment test on each reporting unit prior to aggregation no impairments were identified 

during 2015 we determined that our production studios raw betty and us studios reporting units met the aggregation criteria and we aggregated them into one reporting unit in 2015 the studios businesses were realigned under a new single management team to unify strategy in the aggregation assessment we considered various factors including the nature of the components operations the similarity of operating margins by production genre and the management structure of the components studios components are managed by the studios group executing a broader strategy operate in a similar manner and have similar products and customers we performed a goodwill impairment test on each reporting unit prior to aggregation no impairments were identified 

as a result of the european and studios aggregations we reduced the number of our reporting units from eleven to six 

for 2015 we performed qualitative assessments prior to aggregation for all but three of our reporting units each of these reporting units had a fair value that exceeded its respective carrying value by at least 45 as of the date of the last quantitative impairment assessment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key personnel and our share price based on this assessment we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values 

we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for our remaining three reporting units eurosport raw and betty which had aggregate goodwill of 763 million as of november 30 2015 the first step of the assessment required the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the first step we determined the fair value of these reporting units by using a combination of a discounted cash flow “dcf” analyses and marketbased valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on the reporting units budget longterm business plan and recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions in assessing the reasonableness of the determined fair values we also evaluated the results against other value indicators such as comparable analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value by 8 to 26 the reporting unit with fair value in excess of 

carrying value of less than 10 related to a recent acquisition eurosport which was not integrated into another reporting unit prior to this quantitative assessment subsequent to this quantitative impairment assessment the business was aggregated as a component of the europe reporting unit significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included discount rates that ranged from 9 to 15 and longterm growth rates that ranged from 2 to 35 

given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a dcf analysis actual results may differ from those used in our valuations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our potential borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2015 we had access to a 15 billion  revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program with outstanding borrowings of 782 million  and 93 million  respectively as of december 31 2015  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt in february 2016 the company amended and restated the revolving credit facility to extend dcls borrowing capacity to 20 billion extend the maturity date to february 4 2021 and add the ability to request up to two additional 364day renewal periods as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding debt book balance of 68 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates 

our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid as of december 31 2015  we have no outstanding interest rate swaps 

as of december 31 2015  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 66 billion  the fair value of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 542 million  as of december 31 2015  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings through december 31 2015  our international networks segment is divided into the following five regions northern europe ceemea southern europe latin america and asiapacific cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely consequently we do not hedge our investment in the net assets of those foreign operations 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the 

transactions moreover we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income other comprehensive income and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

we have operations in venezuela and as a result hold monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars bsf companies operating in venezuela are required to obtain venezuelan government approval to exchange bsf into us dollars and our ability to repatriate cash generated in venezuela at the official exchange rate is uncertain in 2014 we applied a devalued exchange rate of 107 bsf per us dollar as established by an alternative currency exchange mechanism known as sistema complementario de administracion de divisas sicad i in remeasuring bsf denominated monetary assets as of december 31 2014 we held approximately 30 million  in bsf denominated monetary assets principally in cash and accounts receivable in february 2015 the venezuelan government created a new open market foreign exchange system referred to as simadi which allowed for trading bolivars at prices set by the market  and merged sicad i with sicad ii the “sicad” exchange mechanism beginning april 1 2015 we applied a devalued sicad exchange rate to remeasure revenue and monetary asset balances based upon facts and circumstances the devalued sicad rate was the most probable settlement rate for our transactions as of december 31 2015  the company no longer believes it can successfully convert bsf at the devalued sicad rate and remeasured bsf denominated monetary assets at the simadi exchange rate the simadi rate on december 31 2015 was 1995 bsf per us dollar the changes in the bsf exchange rate used by the company resulted in a foreign currency remeasurement loss of 40 million  for bsf denominated monetary assets during the year ended december 31 2015  bsf  denominated assets total 3 million   as of december 31 2015 

 in addition to the venezuelan bolivar the company has foreign currency exposure related to other currencies such as the euro the british pound currencies in the nordics the brazilian real the japanese yen and the russian ruble we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments held at december 31 2015  was an asset value of 19 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures that were not hedged as of december 31 2015  we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the fair value of investments classified as availableforsale securities we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market values we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method availableforsale securities and other highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees availableforsale securities and mutual funds were 567 million  162 million  and 149 million  respectively at december 31 2015  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

advertising revenue is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in the us advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and by committing to purchase in advance lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year a portion of many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce purchase commitments in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time when the commercials will be run which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates the mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions 

 in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks in the us that utilize the following brands

 international networks 

international networks generated revenues of 32 billion  and adjusted oibda of 11 billion  during 2014  which represented 50  and 45  of our total consolidated revenues and adjusted oibda respectively our international networks segment principally consists of national and panregional television networks this segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every pay television market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london singapore and miami global brands include discovery channel animal planet tlc id science channel and turbo known as velocity in the us along with brands exclusive to international networks including eurosport dmax and discovery kids international networks has a large international distribution platform for its 38  networks with as many as 13  networks distributed in any particular country or territory across the more than 220  countries and territories around the world where our networks are distributed including all acquisitions at december 31 2014  international networks operated over 330  unique distribution feeds in over 40  languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities international networks also has freetoair networks in europe and the middle east and broadcast networks in the nordics and continues to pursue further international expansion the penetration and growth rates of pay television services vary across the 220  countries and territories depending on the dominance of different television platforms in local markets while pay television services have greater penetration in certain markets freetoair or broadcast television are dominant in others international networks pursues distribution across all television platforms based on the specific dynamics of local markets and relevant commercial agreements in addition to the global networks described in the overview section above we operate networks internationally that utilize the following brands

our international networks segment also owns and operates the following regional television networks which reached the following number of subscribers and viewers via pay and freetoair or broadcast networks respectively as of december 31 2014    





a number of subscribers corresponds to the sum of the subscribers to each of the sbs nordic broadcast networks in sweden norway finland and denmark subject to retransmission agreements with pay television providers 

similar to us networks a significant source of revenue for international networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks such operators primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while 

customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide 

the other significant source of revenue for international networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks similar to us networks advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and freetoair television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets in developing television markets we expect that advertising revenue growth will result from continued subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from traditional broadcast networks to channels in the multichannel environment in relatively mature markets such as western europe we anticipate that growth in advertising revenue will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing television networks launching new services and through acquisitions 

during 2014  distribution advertising and other revenues were 49  47  and 4  respectively of total net revenues for this segment while the company has traditionally operated cable networks an increasing portion of the companys international ad revenue is generated by freetoair or broadcast networks paytv networks freetoair or broadcast networks which include the sbs networks and radio networks generated 42 49 and 9 of international networks 2014  advertising revenue respectively

on december 28 2012  we acquired switchover media a group of five italian television channels with childrens and entertainment programming 

these acquisitions have been included in our operating results since the acquisition date see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

education and other 

education and other generated revenues of  160 million  during 2014  which represented 3  of our total consolidated revenues education is comprised of curriculumbased product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculumbased vod tools professional development services digital textbooks and to a lesser extent student assessments and publication of hardcopy curriculumbased content on november 1 2013  we acquired an education business in the uk that will complement our existing service offerings and expand our operations internationally see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers and wholly owned production studios 

our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce while we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because at times worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairments and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives however certain networks also utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content content is amortized over periods of up to five years the costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present such as low viewership or limited expected use impairment losses are recorded for content asset carrying value in excess of its net realizable value 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite telecommunication and digital service providers and advertising sold on our networks and websites other transactions include curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services production of content content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2014  distribution advertising and other revenues were 46  49  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenues no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2014  2013  or 2012  

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discoverys network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

in the us approximately 90  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2015 through 2021  outside of the us approximately 45  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content these digital distribution agreements are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

advertising 

our advertising revenue consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in pay television broadcast or freetoair television environments 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of freetoair television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our websites on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with curriculumbased products and services the licensing of our brands for consumer products and thirdparty content sales and content production from our production studios 

competition 

television network content is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content and sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership our networks compete with other production studios other television networks and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our networks viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our network content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local networks online and mobile outlets radio content and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business competes with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the european union in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against content networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require mvpds such as cable and satellite operators to obtain the broadcasters consent before distributing the broadcasters signal to the mvpds subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for 

their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of content our content and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material the 21 st  century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain ipdelivered video content that we offer 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

violent programming 

in 2007 the fcc issued a report on violence in programing that recommended congress prohibit the availability of violent programming including cable programming during hours when children are likely to be watching recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of congress in the alleged effects of violent programming which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

foreign laws and regulations 

the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses we own and operate paytv networks in russia which represent less than 2  of our consolidated total revenues russias legislature passed a bill prohibiting advertising on pay cable channels that became effective on january 1 2015  russia also approved a law requiring foreign owners of russian television channels to reduce their ownership to 20 or less by january 1 2017  these changes are likely to adversely affect our results of operations 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 6800  employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

consolidation among cable and satellite providers both domestically and internationally could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 90  of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times through 2021 some of our largest distributors are combining and have gained or may gain market power which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our us and foreign viewers which may be unpredictable and volatile 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways 

technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable 

consumers are increasingly viewing content on a timedelayed or ondemand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens such as televisions tablets mobile phones and other devices additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues there is increased demand for shortform usergenerated and interactive content which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings digital downloads rights lockers rentals and subscription services are competing for consumer preferences with each other and with traditional physical distribution of dvds and bluray discs each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable distribution windows are also evolving potentially affecting revenues from other windows if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

we face cybersecurity and similar risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information disruption of our programming services damage to our brands and reputation legal exposure and financial losses 

our online mobile and app offerings as well as our internal systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming although we monitor our security measures regularly they may be breached due to employee error computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information which may include user data a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services damage to our brands and reputation a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services and significant legal and financial exposure each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

our businesses operate in highly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers businesses including ours that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries that we currently have operations in our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business competes with other providers of education products to schools if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to renew renewal with less favorable terms or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

interpretation of some terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to our international operations 

we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states as a result our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business many of which are beyond our control these risks include 

 events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from nonus sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects 

furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business 

our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets we derive substantial revenues from advertisers and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the us and other countries where our networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues 

decreases in us and consumer discretionary spending in other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multichannel video programming distributors which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues similarly a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers 

economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and reduce their spending on advertising economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world specifically could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas 

domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are 

carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other content services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope for example russia’s legislature passed a bill prohibiting advertising on pay cable channels which became effective january 1 2015  russia also approved a law requiring foreign owners of russian television channels to reduce their ownership to 20 or less by january 1 2017  we currently own and operate paytv networks in russia these restrictions will likely have an adverse effect on our operating results 

financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations 

increased volatility and disruptions in the us and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased as a result we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and net asset balances there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses assets products or technologies could harm our operating results 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we have acquired and have made strategic investments in a number of companies including through joint ventures in the past and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities use of our cash resources and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks including 

 20 

 our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our equity method investments financial performance may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in certain entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding 

we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 72 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

as a holding company we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject we are required to accrue and pay us taxes for repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

theft of our content including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 

the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” and liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts 

liberty media liberty global and liberty interactive together the liberty entities own interests in various us and international companies that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including any liberty entities for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

we have directors that are also related persons of advancenewhouse programming partnership advancenewhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board 

our tenperson board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse in addition our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty interactive all of which include john c malone as chairman of the 

boards of those companies the parent company of advancenewhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses 

advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a convertible preferred stock the advancenewhouse series a convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 25  of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions 

none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 46  of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 28  of the aggregate voting power of liberty global shares representing approximately 37  of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive and shares representing approximately 22  of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 29  of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our seven common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own liberty media liberty global andor liberty interactive stock and stock incentives and own our stock and stock incentives 

these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us advancenewhouse andor the liberty entities for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or an advancenewhouse andor the liberty entity on the other hand look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at advancenewhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

 23 

 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

if advancenewhouse were to exercise its registration rights it may cause a significant decline in our stock price even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s series a convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into one share of our series a common stock and one share of our series c common stock and advancenewhouse’s series c convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of our series c common stock on a 2for1 basis subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders 

for corporate matters other than the election of directors mr malone and advancenewhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 22  and 25  respectively of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock with respect to the election of directors mr malone controls approximately 29  of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the seven common stock directors assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse the “an preferred stock” has not been converted into shares of our common stock the an preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board subject to certain conditions but does not vote with respect to the election of the seven common stock directors also under the terms of the an preferred stock advancenewhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws fundamental changes in our business mergers and other business combinations certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock although there is no stockholder agreement voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr malone and advancenewhouse by virtue of their respective holdings mr malone and advancenewhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders

items impacting comparability 

newly acquired businesses 

on may 30 2014  we acquired a controlling interest in eurosport and on april 9 2013  we acquired sbs nordic see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we included the operations of eurosport and sbs nordic newly acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates as a result newly acquired businesses have impacted the comparability of our results of operations between 2014  and 2013  accordingly to assist the reader in understanding the changes in our results of operations the following tables present the calculation of comparative adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization adjusted oibda excluding the newly acquired businesses as reported within our consolidated financial statements in millions the comparability of the results of the us networks segment was not impacted by these acquisitions the column newly acquired businesses for the year ended december 31 2014  consists of the operating results of eurosport since its acquisition on may 30 2014  and the results of sbs nordic for the three months ended march 31 2014 newly acquired businesses do not include discovery family which was acquired on september 23 2014  the eight days of sbs nordics results from april 1 2013 through april 9 2013 or other less significant acquisitions made during 2014  because their results did not materially impact the comparability of operations except as otherwise noted within this item adjusted oibda is defined and a reconciliation to operating income is presented below in segment results of operations –  2014 vs 2013

consolidated results of operations – 2014  vs 2013 

our consolidated results of operations for 2014  and 2013  were as follows in millions 



nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations newly acquired businesses and the effects of the consolidation of discovery family distribution revenue increased   3  or  85 million  as a result of an increase of 109 million  at our international networks segment partially offset by a decrease of 24 million  at our us networks segment the increase in our international networks distribution revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency and newly acquired businesses was mostly attributable to revenue growth in latin america and to a lesser extent to growth in central and eastern europe the middle east and africa ceemea the revenue growth in latin america was due to increases in subscribers and affiliate rates and in ceemea was due to increases in subscribers for us networks excluding declines in digital distribution resulting from lower content deliveries offset by an increase due to the consolidation of discovery family see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements distribution revenue increased by 6  primarily due to contractual rate increases digital distribution revenue which is earned under agreements to license programs is recognized when the content has been delivered and is available for use by the customer digital distribution revenue is therefore prone to fluctuations based on the timing and volume of content deliveries 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels and the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets which is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses advertising revenue increased   7  or 191 million  as a result of increases of 162 million  at our international networks segment and 29 million  at our us networks segment for our international networks segment the increase was mostly due to pricing and ratings increases on our freetoair networks in western europe and to a lesser extent pricing increases in the nordics and volume increases in latin america for our us networks segment the increase was mostly due to increases in pricing and to a lesser extent the volume of commercial units sold partially offset by lower audience delivery 

excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses other revenue increased   2  or 6 million  the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue at our education and other segments due to other business combinations in late 2013 and early 2014 offset by a decrease in representation fees at us networks  

costs of revenues 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations newly acquired businesses the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and digital distribution costs of revenues increased   10  or 175 million  the increase was the result of increases of 110 million  at our international networks segment 48 million  at our us networks segment and 10 million  at our education and other segments the increase in costs of revenues at our international networks segment was primarily attributable to increased investment in content acquired from us networks and locally acquired content and to a lesser extent an increase in sales commissions the increase in costs of revenues at our us networks segment was primarily attributable to an increase in content expense due to additional spending on content in current and recent periods these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales commissions 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses selling general and administrative expenses decreased   3  or 51 million  the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in equitybased compensation expense and to a lesser extent a decrease in marketing expenses these decreases were partially offset by increases in personnel costs and to a lesser extent various other items the decrease in equitybased compensation expense was due to decreases in our share price 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets depreciation and amortization expense increased 53 million  the increase was mostly attributable to amortization of intangible assets of businesses acquired during 2014  see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges increased 74 million  in 2014  the increase was mostly related to content impairments resulting from the post acquisition rebranding of the hub network to discovery family and the cancellation of certain high profile series due to legal circumstances pertaining to the associated talent and to a lesser extent employee terminations associated with the integration of recent acquisitions see note 7 and note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

gain on disposition 

gain on disposition was 31 million  for the sale of hsw and 19 million  for the sale of petfinder for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  respectively see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 22 million  due to an increase in outstanding debt 

income from equity investees net 

income from our equity method investees increased 5 million  in 2014  due to improved operating results at own offset by losses at all3media related to economic hedges that did not receive hedge accounting and the amortization of intangibles for the step up in the fair value of assets acquired 

other expense income net 

the table below presents the details of other expense income net in millions 



other expense income net decreased 58 million  in 2014  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in remeasurement gains recognized related to the acquisition of former equity method investees see note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and foreign currency losses in 2014  offset by derivative losses related to the acquisition of sbs on april 9 2013  for which there is no similar item in the current period the changes in foreign currency are primarily driven by the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities in the nordic region and venezuela and to a lesser extent russia 

provision for income taxes 

the following table reconciles the companys effective income tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate 



our provisions for income taxes on income from continuing operations were 610 million  and 659 million  and the effective tax rates were 35  and 38  for 2014  and 2013  respectively the net 3  decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several factors including a decline in other net driven by nondeductible hedging losses associated with the acquisition of sbs nordic on april 9 2013 and the reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the change in tax rate in the united kingdom in the prior year for which no similar change took place in the current period additionally the decrease for 2014 included a 1  decrease related to the domestic production activities deduction following certain legislative changes in 2013 these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 2  in the 2014  tax rate due to the  92 million  remeasurement gain on the previously held equity interest in discovery japan recognized upon consolidation in 2013 which was not taxable because we intend to defer indefinitely the realization of this gain for tax purposes

we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda adjusted oibda is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses excluding i marktomarket equitybased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii amortization of deferred launch incentives iv restructuring and other charges v certain impairment charges vi gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and vii certain intersegment eliminations related to production studios we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses we exclude marktomarket equitybased compensation restructuring and other charges certain impairment charges and gains and losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period additionally certain corporate expenses and intersegment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

revenues 

distribution revenue decreased 5 million  excluding declines in digital distribution resulting from lower content deliveries and an increase due to the consolidation of discovery family distribution revenue increased by 6  primarily due to contractual rate increases as the subscriber base for the us pay television market has declined slightly digital distribution revenue which is earned under agreements to license selected library titles is recognized when the content has been delivered and is available for use by the customer 

advertising revenue increased 29 million  the increase was mostly attributable to increases in pricing and to a lesser extent the volume of commercial units sold partially offset by lower audience delivery 

other revenue decreased 21 million  the decrease was mostly attributable to lower representation fees which have been eliminated now that discovery family has been consolidated as well as decreases in various other items 

costs of revenues 

excluding the effect of the consolidation of discovery family and digital distribution costs of revenues increased  48 million  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in content expense due to additional spending on content in current and prior years these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales commissions 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 20 million  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in marketing costs 

adjusted oibda 

adjusted oibda decreased 2  or 32 million  revenue for 2014  was consistent with the prior period as increases in advertising revenue were largely offset by decreases in digital distribution revenue and other revenue higher costs in the current year were primarily due to increased content expense which was partially offset by lower marketing costs

revenues 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses distribution revenue increased   9  or 109 million  the increase was mostly attributable to revenue growth in latin america and to a lesser extent to growth in ceemea the revenue growth in latin america was due to increases in subscribers and affiliate rates while in ceemea it was due to increases in subscribers such growth is consistent with the continued development of the pay television markets in those regions 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses advertising revenue increased   14  or 162 million  the increase was mostly due to pricing and ratings increases on our freetoair networks in western europe and to a lesser extent pricing increases in the nordics and volume increases in latin america 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses other revenue was consistent with the prior period 

costs of revenues 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses costs of revenues increased   12  or 110 million  the increase was primarily attributable to increased investment in us networks and locally acquired content in recent years and to a lesser extent an increase in sales commissions 

selling general and administrative 

excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses selling general and administrative expenses remained comparable with the prior year cost reductions in marketing were offset by increased personnel costs to support a localization strategy as certain activities are transitioned out of regional hubs

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management administrative support services and substantially all of our equitybased compensation 

adjusted oibda decreased  30 million  mostly attributable to increased personnel costs to support a broader corporate function for international operations 

the decrease in marktomarket equitybased compensation expense was attributable to decreases in discovery stock price during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for sars and unit awards see note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels and the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets which is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses consolidated advertising revenue increased 13 or 258 million as a result of increases of 120 million at our us networks segment and 138 million at our international networks segment for our us networks segment the increases were due to improved pricing and advertiser demand in equivalent amounts for our international networks segment most of the increase was in western europe due to higher ratings and pricing on our freetoair networks and to a lesser extent improved ratings and pricing in latin america 

excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses other revenue was consistent with the prior year due to an increase of 12 million at our education and other operating segments offset by a decrease at our international networks segment primarily attributable to the consolidation of discovery japan 

costs of revenues 

excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses costs of revenues increased 13 or 156 million the increase was a result of increases of 83 million at our us networks segment and 73 million at our international networks segment the increases in costs of revenues were mostly due to increases in content expense which is consistent with our commitment to content development the remaining increase was due to various other items such as sales commissions which are correlated to the increase in revenues

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets depreciation and amortization expense increased 159 million the increase was due to the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations during 2013 see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and other charges

our provisions for income taxes on income from continuing operations were 659 million and 562 million and the effective tax rates were 38 and 37 for 2013 and 2012 respectively the net 1 increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the effect of foreign operations which increased 3 from 2012 due to the tax effect of intercompany transactions subject to foreign income tax rates that vary compared with us rates changes in the tax law regarding the domestic production activity deduction in 2013 and other tax differences resulted in an additional 2 increase in the effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by decreases in the tax rate due to changes in apportionment for state income taxes of 2 and the 92 million remeasurement gain on previously held equity interest of 2 which was not taxable in 2013 because the company intends to defer indefinitely the realization of this gain for tax purposes we also increased our unrecognized tax benefits reserve in 2013 due to uncertainties regarding the valuation of certain assets and to a lesser extent in approximately equivalent amounts the taxation of income among multiple jurisdictions and provisions related to uncertainties regarding tax incentives and credits see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our potential borrowing activities we have access to a 15 billion  revolving credit facility and commercial paper program with outstanding borrowings of 38 million  and 229 million  respectively as of december 31 2014  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is variable based on an underlying index and dcls thencurrent credit rating for its publicly traded debt as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding debt of 67 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors 

a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives 

we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid as of december 31 2014  we held interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 475 million  and a net fair market liability value of 28 million  

as of december 31 2014  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 75 billion  the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 642 million  as of december 31 2014  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings through december 31 2014  our international networks segment is divided into the following five regions western europe nordics ceemea latin america and asiapacific cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or drawdowns from our revolving credit facility the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely consequently we do not hedge our investment in the net assets of those foreign operations 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover to the extent that the revenues costs and expenses of one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income other comprehensive income and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

during the year ended december 31 2014 there have been changes in venezuelas currency exchange mechanisms companies operating in venezuela including our customers are required to obtain venezuelan government approval to exchange venezuelan bolivars into us dollars at the official exchange rate of 63 bolivars per us dollar as a result of recent events in venezuela our customers have been unable to obtain such approval and our ability to repatriate cash generated in venezuela at the official exchange rate is uncertain beginning january 23 2014 we applied a devalued exchange rate of 107 bolivars per us dollar as established by an alternative currency exchange mechanism known as sistema complementario de administracion de divisas sicad i in remeasuring our eligible venezuelan bolivar denominated monetary assets as of december 31 2014 the company held approximately 30 million  in venezuelan bolivar denominated assets which may be exposed to further devaluation if the sicad i exchange mechanism is not available to us or the sicad i exchange rate deteriorates 

 in addition to the venezuelan bolivar the company has foreign currency exposure related to the euro the british pound currencies in the nordics the brazilian real and the russian ruble we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content certain intercompany transactions or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments held at december 31 2014  was an asset of 23 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2014  we generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

derivatives 

we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure while derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method and highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees and mutual funds were 644 million  and 147 million  respectively at december 31 2014  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and if applicable for annual graduated rate increases carriage of our networks depends on channel placement and package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages also referred to as digital tiers 

advertising revenue is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in the us advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and by committing to purchase in advance lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year a portion of many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce purchase commitments in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time when the commercials will be run which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates the mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions

similar to us networks the primary sources of revenue for international networks are fees charged to operators who distribute our networks which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers and advertising sold on our television networks international television markets vary in their stages of development some markets such as the uk are more advanced digital television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies common practice in some markets results in longterm contractual distribution relationships while customers in other markets renew contracts annually distribution revenue for our international networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content the rates negotiated in the agreements and the market demand for the content that we provide 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the development of pay and freetoair television markets the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in certain markets our advertising sales business operates with inhouse sales teams while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets in developing television markets we expect that advertising revenue growth will result from continued subscriber and viewership growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from traditional analog networks to channels in the multichannel environment in relatively mature markets such as western europe growth in advertising revenue will come from increasing viewership and pricing of advertising on our existing television networks and the launching of new services both organic and through acquisitions during 2013  distribution advertising and other revenues were 50  47  and 3  respectively of total net revenues for this segment 

on january 21 2014  we entered into an agreement with tf1 to acquire a controlling interest in eurosport international eurosport a leading paneuropean sports media platform by increasing our ownership stake from 20  to 51  for cash of approximately €253 million   343 million  subject to working capital adjustments due to regulatory constraints the acquisition initially excludes eurosport france a subsidiary of eurosport we will retain a 20  equity interest in eurosport france and a commitment to acquire another 31  ownership interest beginning 2015 contingent upon resolution of all regulatory matters the flagship eurosport network focuses on regionally popular sports such as tennis skiing cycling and motor sports and reaches 133 million  homes across 54  countries in 20  languages eurosport’s brands and platforms also include eurosport hd high definition simulcast eurosport 2 eurosport 2 hd high definition simulcast eurosport asiapacific and eurosportnews the acquisition is intended to increase the growth of eurosport and enhance our pay television offerings in europe tf1 will have the right to put the entirety of its remaining 49 noncontrolling interest to us for approximately two and a half  years after completion of this acquisition the put has a floor value equal to the fair value at the acquisition date if exercised in the 90 day period beginning on july 1 2015 and is subsequently priced at fair value if exercised in the 90 day period beginning on july 1 2016 we expect the acquisition to close in the second quarter of 2014 subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from whollyowned production companies and a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed produced content includes content that we engage third parties to develop and produce while we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop because at times worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences which is typically produced through thirdparty production companies international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films television series and sporting events from thirdparty producers 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairments and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives certain networks utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from i fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite telecommunication and digital service providers ii advertising sold on our networks and websites and iii other transactions including curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2013  distribution advertising and other revenues were 46  49  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenues no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2013  2012  or 2011  

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discovery network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of affiliate fees charged to cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers for distribution rights to our television networks we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon channel placement and package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content digital distribution agreements are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

in the us approximately 90  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2014 through 2020  outside of the us approximately 50  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

advertising 

our advertising revenue consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of freetoair television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in pay television broadcast or freetoair television environments 

revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our websites on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with providing affiliate and advertising sales representation and network services for equity method investee networks curriculumbased products and services and the licensing of our brands for consumer products 

competition 

television network content is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content selling of commercial time on our networks and viewership our networks compete with studios television networks and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends 

on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our networks viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our network content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local networks online and mobile outlets radio content and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business competes with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the european union in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against content networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive 

arrangements with cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and dbs operators the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require consent from mvpds such as cable and satellite operators before distributing its signal to their subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of content our content and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material the 21 st  century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain ipdelivered video content that we offer 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

violent programming 

in 2007 the fcc issued a report on violence in programing that recommended congress prohibit the availability of violent programming including cable programming during hours when children are likely to be watching recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of congress in the alleged effects of violent programming which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several websites which we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 5700  employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our whollyowned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

our success is dependent upon us and foreign audience acceptance of our entertainment content which is difficult to predict 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace at the same time certain of our consolidated and equity method investee networks are new there is no assurance of audience acceptance of the programming available on these new brands other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in consumer behavior resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms may impact the performance of our businesses 

our business is focused on television and we face emerging competition from other providers of digital media some of which have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do in particular content offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved providers such as hulu netflix apple tv amazon google tv and intel as well as gaming and other consoles such as microsofts xbox and xbox one sonys ps3 and ps4 nintendos wii and roku are aggressively establishing themselves as alternative providers of video services these services and the growing availability of online content coupled with an expanding market for mobile devices and tablets that allow users to view content on an ondemand basis and internetconnected televisions may impact our traditional distribution methods for our services and content additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content have caused changes in consumer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

we operate in increasingly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals and online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers in addition there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business competes with other providers of education products to schools if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

further consolidation among cable and satellite providers could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 90  of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times beginning in 2014 through 2020  in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our content and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue 

the loss of our affiliation agreements or renewals with less advantageous terms could cause our revenue to decline 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

some terms of our agreements with distributors could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect distribution revenue payable to us under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may not be able to complete any transactions and these transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including 

 in addition we may not be able to integrate operate maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees successfully or profitably we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies the integration of the sbs nordic business following the completion of that acquisition and other recently acquired businesses and assets including eurosport discovery japan and switchover media may not be successful may divert management attention and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

new acquisitions equity method investments and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing businesses or be distributed to shareholders 

the financial performance of our equity method investments may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in certain entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and whether we have any influence or control over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures are recently launched networks which may require significant funding before achieving profitability 

our business could be adversely affected by any worsening of economic conditions 

we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on our networks expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns a deterioration in the current economic conditions may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities a decrease in advertising expenditures would have an adverse effect on our business a decline in economic conditions usually impacts consumer discretionary spending a reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television subscriptions particularly to the more expensive digital service tiers which could lead to a decrease in our distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for advertising 

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 65 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 the loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including 

mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

we are a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject we are required to accrue and pay us taxes for repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

risks associated with our international operations could harm our financial condition 

our networks are offered worldwide and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets some of which are emerging markets inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include among other things changes in the economic environment exchange controls tariffs and other trade barriers longer payment cycles foreign taxation corruption and increased risk of political instability in some markets as we continue to expand the provision of our products and services to international markets these risks and uncertainties may harm our results of operations 

furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar as a result we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

financial market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

the ongoing changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

our business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations both domestic and foreign 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other content services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

piracy of our entertainment content including digital piracy may decrease revenue received from our entertainment content and adversely affect our business and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content 

our directors overlap with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global plc “liberty global” liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” and certain related persons of advancenewhouse which may lead to conflicting interests

nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses consolidated distribution revenue increased   10  or 220 million  as a result of increases of 72 million  at our us networks segment and 148 million  at our international networks segment the increase in distribution revenue at us networks excluding the impact of digital distribution revenue was 5  digital distribution revenue which is earned under agreements to license selected library titles is recognized when the content has been delivered and is available for use by the customer digital distribution revenue is therefore prone to quarterly fluctuations based on the timing and volume of content deliveries the increases in our international networks distribution revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency and newly acquired businesses were attributable in equivalent amounts to the consolidation of discovery japan and revenue growth in latin america due to increases in subscribers and rates 

advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels and the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets which is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses consolidated advertising revenue increased   13  or 258 million  as a result of increases of 120 million  at our us networks segment and 138 million  at our international networks segment for our us networks segment the increases were due to improved pricing and advertiser demand in equivalent amounts for our international networks segment most of the increase was in western europe due to higher ratings and pricing on our freetoair networks and to a lesser extent improved ratings and pricing in latin america 

excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses other revenue was consistent with the prior year due to an increase of 12 million  at our us networks segment offset by a decrease at our international networks segment primarily attributable to the consolidation of discovery japan 

costs of revenues 

excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses costs of revenues increased   13  or 156 million  the increase was a result of increases of 83 million  at our us networks segment and 73 million  at our international networks segment the increases in costs of revenues were mostly due to increases in content expense which is consistent with our commitment to content development the remaining increase was due to various other items such as sales commissions which are correlated to the increase in revenues 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and newly acquired businesses selling general and administrative expenses increased   13  or 169 million  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel costs including equity based compensation expense marketing expenses and to a lesser extent increases in other selling general and administrative costs the increase in equity based compensation expense was largely driven by the increase in our share price 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets depreciation and amortization expense increased 159 million  the increase was due to the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations during 2013  see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges increased 10 million  in 2013  the increase is mostly due to restructuring the companys existing operations in the nordic region following the acquisition of sbs nordic see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 58 million  due to an increase in outstanding debt 

losses from equity investees net 

losses from our equity method investees decreased 104 million  in 2013  due primarily to improved operating results at own additionally own incurred significant content impairment and restructuring charges in 2012  for which no similar expense was incurred in 2013  

other income expense net 

other income expense net increased 29 million  during 2013  we purchased an additional 30 ownership interest in discovery japan which was previously a 50 owned equity method investee we recognized a 92 million  remeasurement gain upon consolidation to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the 50 previously held equity interest see note 3 to the accompanying financial statements this increase was partially offset by losses on derivative instruments of 62 million  in 2013  the losses on derivative contracts resulted from foreign exchange strategies implemented to hedge the purchase of sbs nordic see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements which was denominated in euro and closed on april 9 2013  although effective from an economic perspective this hedging strategy did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the forecasted transaction was a business combination there was a 2 million  loss on derivative instruments in 2012  

provision for income taxes 

our provisions for income taxes on income from continuing operations were 659 million  and 562 million  and the effective tax rates were 38  and 37  for 2013  and 2012  respectively the net 1  increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the effect of foreign operations which increased 3 from 2012 due to the tax effect of intercompany transactions subject to foreign income tax rates that vary compared with us rates changes in the tax law regarding the domestic production activity deduction in 2013 and other tax differences resulted in an additional 2 increase in the effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by decreases in the tax rate due to changes in apportionment for state income taxes of 2 and the 92 million  remeasurement gain on previously held equity interest of 2 which is not taxable in the current year because the company intends to defer indefinitely the realization of this gain for tax purposes we also increased our unrecognized tax benefits reserve in 2013  due to uncertainties regarding the valuation of certain assets and to a lesser extent in approximately equivalent amounts the taxation of income among multiple jurisdictions and provisions related to uncertainties regarding tax incentives and credits see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

segment results of operations – 2013  vs 2012 

we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda adjusted oibda is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses excluding i marktomarket equitybased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii amortization of deferred launch incentives iv exit and restructuring charges v certain impairment charges and vi gains losses on business and asset dispositions we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses we exclude marktomarket equitybased compensation exit and restructuring charges certain impairment charges and gains and losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap”

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and accompanying notes management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management 

in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies 

 for an in depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

fair value measurements 

the estimates of fair value of our reporting units are principally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates a discussion of our significant assumptions including a sensitivity analysis with respect to their impact on the estimated value of our reporting units is provided below 

the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the budget and longterm business plans of each reporting unit such assumptions take into account advertising sales and ratings trends terms of affiliate license arrangements and anticipated terms of renewals projected costs for content and changes in the reporting unit cost structures 

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into account our assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we also review marketplace data to assess the reasonableness of our computation of discovery’s overall weighted average cost of capital and when available the discount rates utilized for each of our reporting units 

in determining the fair value of our reporting units we used the following assumptions 

 based on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above a hypothetical 25 reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in an impairment condition 

we have performed sensitivity analyses to illustrate the impact of changes in assumptions underlying the first step of the impairment test based on our annual assessment 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we 

have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure therefore we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our potential borrowing activities we have access to a 10 billion  revolving credit facility with no  amounts outstanding as of december 31 2013  if we were to draw on the revolving credit facility interest would be variable based on an underlying index rate as of december 31 2013  we had outstanding debt of 64 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors 

a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid there were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2013  

as of december 31 2013  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 66 billion  the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 611 million  as of december 31 2013  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings through december 31 2013  our international networks segment is divided into the following five regions western europe nordics ceemea latin america and asiapacific cash is primarily managed from five global locations with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings the earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely consequently we do not hedge our investment in the net assets of those foreign operations 

the functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies nonfunctional currency risk such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements content arrangements equipment purchases payables and receivables including intercompany amounts changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon periodend exchange rates we also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions moreover to the extent that the revenues costs and expenses of one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies we will experience fluctuations in our revenues costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the us dollar which is our reporting currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a separate component of equity any increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies accordingly we may experience a negative impact on our net income other comprehensive income and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency 

 the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the british pound the euro the indian rupee and currencies in the nordics we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue the cost for producing or acquiring content or in connection with forecasted business combinations these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the net market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments held at december 31 2013  was an asset of 12 million  most of our nonfunctional currency risks related to our revenue operating expenses and capital expenditures were not hedged as of december 31 2013  we generally do not hedge 

against the risk that we may incur noncash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into us dollars 

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method and highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees and mutual funds were 11 billion  and 129 million  respectively at december 31 2013  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future

on december 21 2012 our international networks segment acquired 20  equity ownership interests in eurosport a european sports satellite and cable network and a portfolio of pay television networks from tf1 a french media company for 264 million  including transaction costs we have a call right that enables us to purchase a controlling interest in eurosport starting december 2014 and for one year thereafter if we exercise our call right tf1 will have the right to put its remaining interest to us for one year thereafter the arrangement is intended to increase the growth of eurosport which focuses on niche but regionally popular sports such as tennis skiing cycling and skating and enhance our pay television offerings in france on december 28 2012 we acquired switchover media a group of five italian television channels with childrens and entertainment programming see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers our content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as independent producers our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed substantially all produced content includes content that we engage third parties to develop and produce while we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to program rights that we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop because at times worldwide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been previously produced by third parties 

international networks maximizes the use of content from our us networks much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our content can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences which is typically produced through thirdparty production companies international networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of content from us networks we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences 

our largest single cost is content expense which includes content amortization content impairments and production costs we amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current years estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives certain networks utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from i fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable dth satellite and digital service providers ii advertising sold on our networks and websites and iii other transactions including curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2012  distribution advertising and other revenues were 49  46  and 5  respectively of consolidated revenue no individual customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2012  2011  or 2010

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discovery network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of fees charged to cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers for distribution rights to our television networks we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of our networks depends upon channel placement and package inclusion such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the market demand for the content that we provide we have provided distributors launch incentives in the form of cash payments or free periods to carry our networks 

distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content digital distribution agreements are impacted by the quantity as well as the quality of the content discovery provides 

in the us approximately 90  of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2013 through 2020  outside of the us approximately 50  of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

advertising 

our advertising revenue consists of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less 

in the us we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions outside the us advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of television markets the popularity of freetoair television the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth 

our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in mature markets such as the us and western europe high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth instead growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services either in pay television or freetoair television environments 

revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising on our websites on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

we also generate income associated with providing affiliate and advertising sales representation and network services for equity method investee networks curriculumbased products and services and the licensing of our brands for consumer products 

competition 

television network content is a highly competitive business worldwide we experience competition for the development and acquisition of content distribution of our content selling of commercial time on our networks and viewership our networks compete with studios television networks and the internet for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks attracting viewers and the sale of advertising our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our networks viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our network content our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original content viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors the product offering across a series of networks within a region and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local networks online and mobile outlets radio content and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our viewers quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business competes with other providers of curriculumbased products and services to schools 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets include copyrights in television content trademarks in brands names and logos websites and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies such as the european union in which we operate content networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators affect content networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating among competing multichannel video content distributors “mvpds” such as cable and dbs operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against content networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the content network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions the fcc allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements with cable operators to expire in october 2012 but will consider casebycase complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cableaffiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent a competing mvpd from providing satellite or cable programming 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposes “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market dbs systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable operators and dbs operators the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require consent from mvpds such as cable and satellite operators before distributing its signal to their subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast content such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of content for the hearing impaired additionally our content and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material the 21 st  century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 requires us to provide closed captioning on certain ipdelivered video content that we offer 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks 

violent programming 

in 2007 the fcc issued a report on violence in programing that recommended congress prohibit the availability of violent programming including cable programming during hours when children are likely to be watching recent events have led to a renewed interest by some members of congress in the alleged effects of violent programming which could lead to a renewal of interest in limiting the availability of such programming or prohibiting it 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several websites which we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal childrens online privacy protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

employees 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 4500  employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our whollyowned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

our success is dependent upon us and foreign audience acceptance of our entertainment content which is difficult to predict 

the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general in special interest groups in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace at the same time certain of our consolidated and equity method investee networks are new there is no assurance of audience acceptance of the programming available on these new brands other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in consumer behavior resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms may impact the performance of our businesses 

our business is focused on television and we face emerging competition from other providers of digital media some of which have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do in particular content offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved providers such as hulu netflix apple tv amazon google tv and intel as well as gaming and other consoles such as microsofts xbox sonys ps3 nintendos wii and roku are aggressively establishing themselves as alternative providers of video services these services and the growing availability of online content coupled with an expanding market for mobile devices and tablets that allow users to view content on 

an ondemand basis and internetconnected televisions may impact our traditional distribution methods for our services and content additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming including commercials such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content have caused changes in consumer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

we operate in increasingly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals and online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers in addition there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business competes with other providers of education products to schools if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific content adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

further consolidation among cable and satellite providers could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 90 of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times beginning in 2013 through 2020 in addition many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our content and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue 

the loss of our affiliation agreements or renewals with less advantageous terms could cause our revenue to decline 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these persubscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

some terms of our agreements with distributors could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect distribution revenue payable to us under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may not be able to complete any transactions and these transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including 

 in addition we may not be able to integrate operate maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees successfully or profitably  we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies the integration of the sbs nordic business following the completion of that acquisition and other recently acquired businesses and assets may not be successful may divert management attention and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

new acquisitions equity method investments and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing businesses or be distributed to shareholders 

the financial performance of our equity method investments may differ from current estimates 

we have equity investments in certain entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and whether we have any influence or control over the relevant entity any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures are recently launched networks which may require significant funding before achieving profitability 

our business could be adversely affected by any worsening of the current economic condition 

we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on our networks expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns the current economic conditions and any continuation of these adverse conditions including the potential negative impact of the socalled fiscal cliff on financial markets and overall economic activity may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities a decrease in advertising expenditures would have an adverse effect on our business a decline in economic conditions usually impacts consumer discretionary spending a reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television subscriptions particularly to the more expensive digital service tiers which could lead to a decrease in our distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for advertising 

our substantial debt leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 52 billion  of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts associated with our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 15 

 the loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

we are a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject we are required to accrue and pay us taxes for repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

risks associated with our international operations could harm our financial condition 

our networks are offered worldwide and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets some of which are emerging markets inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include among other things changes in the economic environment exchange controls tariffs and other trade barriers longer payment cycles foreign taxation corruption and increased risk of political instability in some markets as we continue to expand the provision of our products and services to international markets these risks and uncertainties may harm our results of operations 

furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the us we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes including the imposition of new restrictions in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business acts of terrorism hostilities or financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar as a result we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

financial market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

the ongoing changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

our business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations both domestic and foreign 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may adopt in the future new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other content services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

piracy of our entertainment content including digital piracy may decrease revenue received from our entertainment content and adversely affect our business and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands dvds television networks digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of highquality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content 

our directors overlap with those of liberty media corporation “liberty media” liberty global inc “liberty global” liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” and certain related persons of advancenewhouse which may lead to conflicting interests

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 432 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased operating results a decrease in taxes paid a decrease in interest payments and decreases in equity compensation payments for cash settled equity awards during 2010 there was a 112 million overpayment of tax the “2010 overpayment” resulting primarily from an extension of the tax law in the fourth quarter of 2010 that allowed for the immediate deduction of certain domestic content costs during 2011 we received a 39 million tax refund related to the 2010 overpayment and there was a decrease in tax payments of 107 million primarily attributable to the use of the remaining overpayment carry forward from 2010 the decrease in interest payments was principally the result of 114 million of makewhole premiums paid in 2010 in connection with the refinancing of most of our outstanding debt the 32 million decrease in payments for cashsettled equity awards was attributable to the decrease in number of outstanding unit awards and sars these improvements were partially offset by a 110 million increase in cash used by operating activities attributable to investments in content

 for a discussion of each of our critical accounting policies including information and analysis of estimates and assumptions involved in their application and other significant accounting policies see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure therefore we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our potential borrowing activities we have access to a 10 billion  revolving credit facility with no  amounts outstanding as of december 31 2012  if we were to draw on the revolving credit facility interest would be variable based on an underlying index rate as of december 31 2012  we had outstanding 52 billion  under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors 

a change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of fixed rate debt our current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows to achieve these objectives we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid there were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2012  

as of december 31 2012  the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 59 billion  the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 515 million  as of december 31 2012  

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates through december 31 2012  our international networks segment reported into the following four regions western europe ceemea asiapacific and latin america cash is managed from our four international regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings since earnings of our international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely we do not hedge our investment in the net assets of those foreign operations 

the functional currency of substantially all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency the financial statements of our foreign corporations are translated into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting as a result fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the british pound the euro and the brazilian real 

we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with the cost for producing or acquiring content abroad these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows the market value of our foreign currency derivative instruments held at december 31 2012  was 2 million  

market values of investments 

in addition to derivatives we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method and highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees and mutual funds were 11 billion  and 571 million  respectively at december 31 2012  investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in interest rates would not materially impact the fair values of our investments in mutual funds as of december 31 2012

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers substantially all content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which includes some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies with which we have developed longstanding relationships as well as independent producers our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed substantially all produced content includes programming which we engage third parties to develop and produce while we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to program rights acquired that we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop coproduced programs are typically highcost projects for which neither we nor our coproducers wish to bear the entire cost or productions in which the producer has already taken on an international broadcast partner licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been previously produced by third parties 

  

international networks maximizes the use of programming from our us networks much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our programming translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our programming can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences which is typically produced through thirdparty production companies 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from i fees charged to operators who distribute our network content which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers and digital distributors ii advertising sold on our networks websites and other digital media services and iii other transactions including curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services for thirdparty networks content licenses postproduction audio services and the licensing of our brands for consumer products no single customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2011 2010 or 2009 

distribution 

distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view discovery network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of fees charged to cable dth satellite and telecommunication service providers for distribution rights to discovery’s television networks typically discovery’s television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements that generally provide for the level of carriage discovery’s networks will receive and if applicable for scheduled graduated annual rate increases carriage of discovery networks depends upon channel placement and package inclusion such as whether on more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content distribution revenues are largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content and the quality and quantity of programming that discovery provides 

as an incentive to obtain longterm distribution agreements for our newer networks we have made cash payments to distributors to carry the network “launch incentives” provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time or both we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors in the us approximately 90 of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2012 through 2020 at the end of 2012 three of these distribution arrangements will expire and we intend to renew these agreements outside of the us less than 50 of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year 

advertising 

our advertising revenues consist of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have terms of one year or less 

in the us advertising revenues are a function of the size and demographics of the audience delivered quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular programming the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies such as nielsen media research as well as overall advertiser demand in the marketplace we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions 

outside the us advertisers buy advertising time closer to the time when the commercials will be run international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital advertising revenues outside of the us are dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of pay television markets the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in developing pay television markets we expect 

  

advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in relatively mature markets such as western europe the growth dynamic is changing increased market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets instead growth in advertising sales would come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay television networks and launching new services either in pay television or free television environments 

revenues from advertising are subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters revenues can also fluctuate due to the popularity of particular programs and viewership ratings in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our online properties we sell advertising on our websites both on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

revenues for curriculumbased services are recognized ratably over the contract term revenues from postproduction audio services are recognized as services are provided 

competition 

television network programming is a highly competitive business in the us and worldwide we experience competition in the development and acquisition of content for the distribution of our programming for the selling of commercial time on our networks and for viewers our networks compete with studios television networks and other forms of media such as dvds and the internet for the acquisition of programming and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular programming is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks attracting viewers and the sale of commercial time our success in securing popular programming and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing programming that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our networks viewership and the production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our programming and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our network programming our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business at the end of 2012 three of our largest us distribution arrangements will expire and we intend to renew these agreements growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our programming that are as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original programming viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local networks online and mobile outlets radio programming and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our viewers quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular programming the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and vod services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business also competes with other providers of curriculumbased products to schools our postproduction audio services business competes with other production and inhouse sound companies 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming websites and other content trademarks in brands names and logos domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds 

  

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult we seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches however the steps taken to prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of our intellectual property may not work 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses both the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our programming including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of local countries and international bodies such as the european union programming networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television distributor other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators affect programming networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite or cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest under fcc rules from entering into exclusive contracts for programming with a distributor and from discriminating among competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” such as cable and satellite operators in the rates terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of programming these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against programming networks if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to carry the programming network on nondiscriminatory rates terms or conditions 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposed “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market direct broadcast satellite “dbs” systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable operators and dbs providers the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require consent from mvpds such as cable and satellite operators before distributing its signal to their subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast programming to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast programming such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the programming funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of programming for the hearing impaired our programming and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising and commercials embedded in our networks’ programming stream adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material in the future the 21 st century communications and video accessibility act of 2010 may require us to provide closed captioning on certain video programming that we offer on the internet 

obscenity restrictions 

network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks 

  

regulation of the internet 

we operate several websites which we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal child online protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 4600 employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our whollyowned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures there were approximately 250 personnel at our postproduction audio services business subject to collective bargaining agreements there are no active grievances strikes or work stoppages and we believe our relations with our union and nonunion employees are strong we do not believe a dispute with employees subject to collective bargaining agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

our success is dependent upon us and foreign audience acceptance of our programming and other entertainment content which is difficult to predict 

the production and distribution of pay television programs and other entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content and programming that meet the changing preferences of viewers in general viewers in special interest groups viewers in specific demographic categories and viewers in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our programming and other content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing programs and other content available in the applicable marketplace at the same time certain of our networks are new or are equity method investees there is no assurance of audience acceptance of these new brands other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy digital and ondemand distribution and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in consumer behavior resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms may impact the performance of our businesses 

our business is focused on television and we face emerging competition from other providers of digital media some of which have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do in particular programming offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved providers such as hulu roku netflix apple tv 

  

amazon and google tv are aggressively working to establish themselves as alternative providers of video services these services and the growing availability of online content coupled with an expanding market for connected devices and internetconnected televisions may impact our traditional distribution methods for our services and content additionally devices that allow users to view television programs on a timeshifted basis and technologies that enable users to fastforward or skip programming have caused changes in consumer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences our business could be adversely affected 

the loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

we operate in increasingly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals and online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers in addition there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the enormously broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business competes with other providers of education products to schools if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific programming adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

further consolidation among cable and satellite providers could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us approximately 90 of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times beginning in 2012 through 2020 in addition many of the international countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our programming and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue not only could the company experience a reduction in affiliate revenues but in advertising revenues which are also impacted by affiliate subscriber amounts 

the loss of our affiliation agreements or renewals with less advantageous terms could cause our revenue to decline 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue these persubscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are favorable to us a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue at the end of 2012 three of these distribution arrangements will expire although we intend to renew these agreements a failure to secure a renewal or a renewal on less favorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected 

  

some terms of our agreements with distributors could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect distribution revenue payable to us under those agreements 

some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that if correct could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to complement or expand our business that may not be successful and we may lose up to the entire value of our investment in these acquisitions and transactions 

our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may not be able to complete any transactions and these transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate operate maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees we may not be able to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

new acquisitions equity method investments and other transactions may require the commitment of significant capital that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing businesses or be distributed to shareholders 

the financial performance of our equity method investments may differ from current estimates used and impact the accounting treatment of certain items 

we have equity investments in certain entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage ownership and whether we have any influence or control over the relevant entity under certain accounting standards any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment in addition if these entities were to fail and cease operations we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits some of our ventures are newly formed networks which may require significant funding before achieving profitability 

our business could be adversely affected by any continuation or worsening of the current economic downturn 

we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on our networks expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns the current economic conditions and any continuation of these adverse conditions may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities a decrease in advertising expenditures would have an adverse effect on our business a decline in economic conditions usually impacts consumer discretionary spending a reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television subscriptions particularly to the more expensive digital service tiers which could lead to a decrease in our distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for advertising 

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 42 billion of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

  

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreements for our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

we are a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions under our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject we are required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate certain cash balances held by foreign corporations however we intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

risks associated with our international operations could harm our financial condition 

our networks are offered worldwide and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets some of which are emerging markets inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include among other things changes in the economic environment exchange controls tariffs and other trade barriers longer payment cycles foreign taxation corruption and in some markets increased risk of political instability as we continue to expand the provision of our products and services to international markets these risks and uncertainties may harm our results of operations 

furthermore some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the united states we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business including the imposition of new restrictions acts of terrorism or other hostilities or other future financial political economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar as a result we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

  

financial market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

the ongoing changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

our business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations both domestic and foreign 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other mvpds are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video programming business see the discussion under “business – regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other programming services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a countrybycountry basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

piracy of our entertainment content including digital piracy may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our business and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands dvds television networks and other programming digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content 

our directors overlap with those of liberty and certain related persons of advancenewhouse which may lead to conflicting interests 

our elevenperson board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media corporation “liberty media” three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global inc “liberty global” and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty interactive corporation “liberty interactive” all of which include john c malone as chairman of the boards of those companies in addition our board of directors includes three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron who was the chairman of advancenewhouse until december 31 2010 and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse the liberty entities and the parent company of advancenewhouse own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses none of the liberty entities own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 58 of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 35 of the aggregate voting power of liberty global owns shares representing approximately 32 of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive and owns shares representing approximately 22 of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 30 of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock awarded by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock those of our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own liberty media liberty global or liberty interactive stock and stock incentives and own our stock and stock incentives advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a convertible preferred stock and two of its directors are its former chairman robert j miron and its chief executive officer steven a miron the advancenewhouse series a convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 25 of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions these ownership interests andor business positions could create or 

  

appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us the liberty entities andor advancenewhouse for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or a liberty entity andor advancenewhouse on the other hand look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at liberty media liberty global liberty interactive or advancenewhouse have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies although the terms of any transactions or agreements will be established based upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case where the parties are at arms’ length 

our overlapping directors with liberty media and liberty interactive may result in the diversion of business opportunities and other potential conflicts 

both liberty media and liberty interactive own interests in various us and international programming companies that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign programming services that may compete with the programming services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international programming opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of liberty media and liberty interactive and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and these liberty entities have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including liberty media or liberty interactive for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

the personal educational media lifelong learning and travel and automotive industry investments by john s hendricks a common stock director and our founder may conflict with or compete with our business activities 

our founder john s hendricks manages his nondiscovery personal business investments through hendricks investment holdings llc “hih” a delaware limited liability company of which he is the sole owner and member hih owns a travel club and travelrelated properties including a resort in gateway colorado and has created a learning academy for guests that includes online and advanced media offerings in the area of informal and lifelong learning certain video productions and offerings of this academy may compete with our educational media offerings we and the academy may enter into a business arrangement for the offering of our video products for sale by the academy andor for the jointproduction of new educational media products or coproduction agreements for programming to be aired on our networks such as the curiosity series in addition from time to time hih or its subsidiaries may enter into transactions with us or our subsidiaries for example through hih mr hendricks owns a number of business interests in the automotive field some of which are involved in programming offered by us in particular on our velocity network although the terms of any such transactions or agreements will be established based upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case where the parties are at arms’ length 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

the exercise by advancenewhouse of its registration rights may cause our stock price to decline significantly even if our business is doing well 

advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advancenewhouse advancenewhouse’s preferred stock is currently convertible into shares of our series a and series c common stock on a 1for1 basis subject to certain antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferrable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it holds the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

john c malone and advancenewhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders 

for corporate matters other than the election of directors john c malone and advancenewhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 22 and 25 respectively of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock with respect to the election of directors mr malone controls approximately 30 of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse the “an preferred stock” has not been converted into shares of our common stock the an preferred stock carries with it the right to designate the three preferred stock directors to our board subject to certain conditions but will not vote with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors also under the terms of the an preferred stock advancenewhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws fundamental changes in our business mergers and other business combinations certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock although there is no stockholder agreement voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr malone and advancenewhouse by virtue of their respective holdings each of mr malone and advancenewhouse likely have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders

business overview 

we are a global nonfiction media and entertainment company that provides programming across multiple distribution platforms throughout the world we distribute customized programming in over 40 languages in the us and over 200 other countries and territories our global portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel one of the first nonfiction networks and our most widely distributed global brand tlc and animal planet we also have a diversified portfolio of websites and other digital media services develop and sell curriculumbased products and services and provide postproduction audio services 

our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership optimize distribution revenue capture advertising sales and create or reposition additional branded channels and businesses that can sustain longterm growth and occupy a desired programming niche with strong consumer appeal our strategy is to optimize the distribution ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded networks we are extending content distribution across new platforms including brandaligned websites mobile devices vod broadband channels and online streaming which provide promotional platforms for our television programming and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue 

  

our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators dth satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers 

we classify our operations in three segments us networks consisting principally of domestic television networks websites and other digital media services international networks consisting primarily of international television networks and websites and education and other consisting principally of curriculumbased product and service offerings and postproduction audio services 

us networks 

us networks generated net revenues of 2619 million during 2011 which represented 62 of our total consolidated net revenues this segment wholly owns and operates nine national television networks including fully distributed television networks such as discovery channel tlc and animal planet in addition this segment holds our interests in own the hub and 3net which are networks operated by equity method investees we account for our interests in the underlying ventures using the equity method and services provided to them as other revenue 

us networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our network content which include cable and dth satellite service providers and digital distributors from advertising sold on our television networks and other arrangements distribution fees are largely based on the number of subscribers receiving our programming distribution revenues are recognized net of incentives we provide to operators in exchange for carrying our networks incentives may include launch incentives providing the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time or both launch incentives are capitalized as assets upon launch of our network by the operator and are amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract including free periods advertising revenues are dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels our us networks segment also generates income to offset expenses associated with providing affiliate and advertising sales representation and network services for equity method investee networks and the licensing of our brands for consumer products during 2011 distribution advertising and other revenues were 45 51 and 4 respectively of total net revenues for this segment the discovery channel tlc and animal planet collectively generated 72 of us networks’ total net revenues 

us networks’ largest single cost is content expense including content amortization content impairments and production costs us networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that current estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives certain networks utilize a straightline method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content 

on january 1 2011 we contributed the domestic discovery health network to own the contribution included affiliate relationships with cable operators and dth satellite service providers content licenses and website user information the contribution did not impact our ownership interest voting control or governance rights related to own but was accompanied by an equitable partner contribution to own we recorded our contribution at fair value which resulted in a pretax gain of 129 million the gain resulted in 27 million of tax expense following the contribution we no longer consolidate the domestic discovery health network additional information is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

international networks 

international networks generated net revenues of 1455 million during 2011 which represented 34 of our total consolidated net revenues international networks consists of national and panregional television networks and a portfolio of websites the discovery channel animal planet and tlc lead the international networks’ portfolio of television networks which are distributed in virtually every paytelevision market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london singapore and miami of us television companies our international networks segment has one of the largest international distribution platforms of television networks with one to twelve networks in more than 200 countries and territories international networks also has free to air networks in the uk germany italy and spain at december 31 2011 international networks operated over 150 unique distribution feeds in over 40 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities 

the international networks segment continues to pursue international expansion in select areas for example in 2010 we began the international rollout of tlc as a femaletargeted global flagship and have launched tlc or a similarly branded network which uses tlc content in over 150 countries and territories during 2011 the company acquired a factual entertainment production company in the uk and a cable channel in latin america to further improve the global strength of tlc 

  

on november 12 2010 we acquired the remaining 50 interest in substantially all of the international animal planet and liv formerly people  arts networks from the bbc increasing our ownership of these networks to 100 previously these networks were operated as 5050 ventures between us and the bbc we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the ventures and therefore consolidated them prior to the acquisition with this acquisition we wholly own and operate most of our international television networks except for channels in japan and canada which are operated by equity method investees that have strategically important local investment partners on february 17 2010 we acquired all interests in an uplink facility in the uk including its employees and operations for a payment of 35 million the uplink facility has been included in the international networks segment operating results since the date of acquisition 

on september 1 2010 we sold antenna audio limited which was a component of our international networks segment which is reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

similar to our us networks segment the primary sources of revenues for international networks are fees charged to operators who distribute our networks which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers and from advertising sold on our television networks distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving our programming and are recognized net of launch incentives international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital advertising revenues are dependent upon a number of factors including the stage of development of pay television markets number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in relatively mature markets such as western europe increased market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets instead growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay television networks and launching new services either in pay television or free television environments during 2011 distribution advertising and other revenues were 61 35 and 4 respectively of total net revenues for this segment 

international networks’ largest cost is content expense international networks executes a localization strategy by offering programming from us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds while our international networks segment maximizes the use of programming from our us networks segment we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that current estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives 

effective january 1 2011 we realigned our international networks reporting structure into the following four regions western europe which includes the uk and western european countries central and eastern europe the middle east and africa “ceemea” latin america and asiapacific previously international networks’ regional operations reported into the following four regions the uk europe excluding the uk the middle east and africa “emea” asiapacific and latin america this realignment did not impact our consolidated financial statements other than to change the regions in which we describe our operating results for the international networks segment 

education and other 

education and other generated net revenues of 162 million during 2011 which represented 4 of our total consolidated net revenues our education and other segment is primarily comprised of curriculumbased product and service offerings and postproduction audio services our education business generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to k12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculumbased vod tools professional development services student assessment tools publication of hardcopy curriculumbased content corporate partnerships and global brand and content licensing other businesses primarily include postproduction audio services that are provided to major motion picture studios independent producers broadcast networks cable channels advertising agencies and interactive producers 

  

results of operations – 2011 vs 2010 

items impacting comparability 

following the contribution of the domestic discovery health network to own on january 1 2011 we no longer consolidate the network the comparability of our results of operations between 2011 and 2010 has been impacted by the deconsolidation accordingly to assist the reader in better understanding the changes in our results of operations the following table presents the results of operations of the discovery health network for 2010 in millions 

 

 reclassifications 

we expanded the types of revenue included in distribution revenue in our consolidated statements of operations during 2011 and reclassified related prior year amounts distribution revenues include fees charged for the right to view discovery network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices the largest component of distribution revenue continues to be fees charged to cable dth satellite and telecommunications service providers for distribution rights to discovery’s television networks distribution revenue also includes fees charged for certain licensing arrangements including those for digital streaming of library content which totaled 109 million in 2011 these fees which totaled 25 million in 2010 were previously classified as other revenue and have been reclassified to distribution revenue to conform to the current presentation 

  

consolidated results of operations – 2011 vs 2010 

our consolidated results of operations for 2011 and 2010 were as follows in millions 

 

 nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenues increased 238 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the effect of no longer consolidating the discovery health network distribution revenues increased 12 or 226 million during 2011 we extended and expanded an agreement to license selected library titles as a result of titles delivered under this and similar agreements license revenue increased 84 million the remaining distribution revenue increase was attributable to contractual rate increases and growth of pay television services and subscribers 

advertising revenues increased 207 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the effect of no longer consolidating the discovery health network advertising revenues increased 16 or 253 million increases were primarily due to worldwide increases in pricing higher sellouts at us networks and international expansion and rebranding of networks advertising revenues also benefited from 13 million in nonrecurring revenue items at our us networks operating segment 

other revenues increased 17 million due to 33 million for the growth in services provided to our unconsolidated equity method investees increases also came from our education business these increases were partially offset by no longer providing services to the travel channel changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the effect of no longer consolidating the discovery health network did not significantly impact other revenues 

  

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist primarily of content expense distribution costs and sales commissions increased 160 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the effect of no longer consolidating the discovery health network costs of revenues increased 17 or 181 million the increase in costs of revenues was principally related to higher content expense of 155 million which primarily reflects our continued investment in content the international expansion of tlc 26 million for content impairments and accelerated content amortization and 11 million for charges associated with the licensing of selected library titles costs of revenues also increased due to higher distribution costs and sales commissions 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which principally comprise employee costs marketing costs research costs occupancy and back office support fees decreased 2 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the effect of no longer consolidating the discovery health network selling general and administrative expenses decreased 2 or 19 million the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreases of 83 million for stockbased compensation stockbased compensation expense decreased 100 million due to a decline in outstanding unit awards and stock appreciation rights “sars” which are cashsettled awards partially offset by an increase in expense of 17 million for stock options performance based restricted stock units “prsus” and service based restricted stock units “rsus” the decreases in stockbased compensations expense were partially offset by higher employee compensation costs increases in headcount increased costs related to the international expansion of tlc greater presence in ceemea and increased research costs related to obtaining ratings services for additional networks 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense which includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finitelived intangible assets decreased 11 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations depreciation and amortization expense decreased 16 or 23 million due to lower asset balances as a result of property equipment and intangible assets becoming fully depreciated in prior periods 

restructuring and impairment charges 

in 2011 we recorded 30 million of restructuring and impairment charges which was comprised of 10 million of exit and restructuring charges and a 20 million goodwill impairment charge exit and restructuring charges for 2011 primarily related to various employee terminations and organizational changes the goodwill impairment charge was due to lower than expected operating performance at our commerce business which is a component of our us networks segment 

during 2010 we recorded 25 million of restructuring and impairment charges which was comprised of 14 million of exit and restructuring charges and an 11 million goodwill impairment charge exit and restructuring charges for 2010 related to the realignment of our reporting regions at our international networks segment cost reduction initiatives in the us and the contribution of the discovery health network to own the charges primarily consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions and contract termination expenses the goodwill impairment charge was due to lower than expected operating performance at our postproduction audio business which is a component of our education and other segment 

gains on dispositions 

in connection with the contribution of the discovery health network to own on january 1 2011 we recorded a pretax gain of 129 million which represents the fair value of the investment retained less the book basis of contributed assets 

interest expense net 

interest expense net was relatively flat in 2011 compared to the prior year due to an increase in the amount of outstanding debt offset by a decrease in interest expense related to realized losses on interest rate swaps recorded during the prior year during 2010 most of our interest rate swaps either matured or were settled prior to maturity as a result of refinancing most of our debt in june 2010 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in june 2010 we refinanced most of our outstanding debt in connection with the repayment of 29 billion of existing debt outstanding under our term loans and private senior notes we recognized a 136 million loss on extinguishment of debt which included 114 million for makewhole premiums 12 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs and 10 million for the repayment of the original issue discount from our term loans 

  

other expense net 

other expense net consisted of the following in millions 

 

 the decrease in realized losses on derivative instruments is a result of reducing the derivatives held by us as part of the issuance of senior notes on june 30 2010 the decrease in losses from equity method investments was primarily attributable to changes associated with our investment in own while we recognized 100 of own’s losses prior to own’s launch on january 1 2011 we have recognized 50 of own’s losses subsequent to the launch during 2012 the company expects operating losses at own to exceed the balance of equity contributions recorded by own once the equity balance of own is depleted discovery expects to continue to fund own and will record 100 of any future operating losses of own in loss from equity investees net future net income generated by own will initially be allocated 100 to us until previously recognized losses in excess of our ownership percentage have been recouped 

provision for income taxes 

for 2011 and 2010 our provisions for income taxes were 425 million and 288 million and the effective tax rates were 27 and 31 respectively 

discovery’s effective tax rate for 2011 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally because our legal entity reorganization resulted in the recognition of 112 million net benefit for foreign tax credits as discussed below and production activity deductions which were partially offset by state income taxes the company was not required to record a deferred tax liability of 21 million with respect to the portion of the outside basis in the own venture attributable to the nondeductible goodwill contributed to own 

in november 2011 the company reorganized certain of its international operations to better align its functions and establish a regional ownership structure the regional holding companies are foreign corporations whose earnings will not be taxed in the us until the earnings are repatriated back to the us the company will not record a provision for deferred us tax expense that could result from the remittance of such undistributed earnings since the company intends to reinvest the earnings outside the us indefinitely as a result of the international reorganization the company has entered into intercompany license and royalty agreements with certain of its controlled foreign corporations to allow the foreign corporations to use intangible property owned by the parent company the license fees will result in incremental us tax expense which will be recognized over the fouryear estimated useful life of the intangible property this incremental tax expense will be partially mitigated by the company’s ability to utilize foreign tax credits for taxes which were deducted in prior years as a result the company recognized an income tax benefit of 112 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the foreign tax credits which were previously not considered realizable due to the lower statutory and negotiated tax rates in the foreign corporations’ jurisdictions the company expects a favorable impact on the effective tax rate in the future under the new operating structure 

our effective tax rate for 2010 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to the reversal of a 28 million foreign tax reserve as a result of a foreign tax authority completing its tax audit and providing us notification that certain tax years will not be adjusted and production activity deductions which were partially offset by state taxes 

loss income from discontinued operations net of taxes 

loss from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to activities connected with businesses classified as discontinued operations in previous years income from discontinued operations in 2010 relates to the sale of our antenna audio business and the elimination of an obligation to acg an entity spun off in 2008 

  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

the 15 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to the acquisition of the bbc’s interests in the international animal planet and liv networks on november 12 2010 following the acquisition we no longer allocate net operating results to noncontrolling interests of these networks 

segment results of operations – 2011 vs 2010 

we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization “adjusted oibda” adjusted oibda is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses excluding i marktomarket stockbased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii amortization of deferred launch incentives iv exit and restructuring charges v certain impairment charges and vi gains losses on business and asset dispositions we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses we exclude marktomarket stockbased compensation exit and restructuring charges certain impairment charges and gains losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income cash flows provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

additionally certain corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon decisions made directly by segment executives additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

revenues 

distribution revenues increased 113 million which was driven by contractual rate increases subscriber growth and reduced amortization of deferred launch incentives these increases were partially offset by an 18 million decline for the effect of deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 and changes in our channel mix in emea changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact distribution revenues 

advertising revenues increased 218 million which was attributable to increased pricing higher inventory utilization and greater audience delivery these increases were partially offset by the absence of a 6 million settlement of a prior contract dispute in 2009 changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact advertising revenues 

other revenues decreased 16 million as a result of an affiliate and advertising sales representation agreement ending in may 2010 transitioning our commerce business model in early 2009 and lower dvd sales at a consolidated joint venture these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of subscriptions to our online curriculumbased education tools other revenues were not significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates

 the change in net realized and unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments was primarily due to changes in the designation and termination of interest rate swaps as a result of refinancing most of our debt in june 2010 

the increase in losses from equity method investments was primarily attributable to own which reflects selling general and administrative costs incurred prior to the launch of the new network on january 1 2011 

in 2009 we sold investments for 22 million which resulted in pretax gains of 15 million 

provision for income taxes 

for 2010 and 2009 our provisions for income taxes were 288 million and 469 million and the effective tax rates were 31 and 45 respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2010 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to the reversal of a 28 million foreign tax reserve as a result of a foreign tax authority completing its tax audit and providing us notification that certain tax years will not be adjusted and production activity deductions which were partially offset by state taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to a permanent difference on the 252 million gain from deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 and state income taxes which were partially offset by deductions for domestic production activities and the release of a valuation allowance of 12 million 

income loss from discontinued operations net of taxes 

on september 1 2010 we sold our antenna audio business for net proceeds of 24 million in cash which resulted in a 9 million gain net of taxes we previously recorded a 12 million gain net of taxes in our results of operations for the quarter ended september 30 2010 however during the quarter ended december 31 2010 we recorded an adjustment to a deferred tax asset which reduced the gain by 3 million antenna audio which provides audio multimedia and mobile tours for museums exhibitions historic sites and visitor attractions around the world was a component of our international networks segment 

on september 27 2010 we received a tax refund which eliminated a 12 million obligation to repay amounts to amc which has been recorded as a benefit in 2010 in income from discontinued operations 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to higher operating results at consolidated entities that are not wholly owned 

stock dividends to preferred interests 

we declared noncash stock dividends of 1 million and 8 million to our preferred stock shareholder during 2010 and 2009 respectively we released approximately 43000 and 254000 of our series a common stock and approximately 60000 and 211000 of our series c common stock from escrow during 2010 and 2009 respectively in payment of most of the dividends declared we are contractually obligated to issue the dividends upon the issuance of our common stock to settle the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights that we assumed in connection with our formation on september 17 2008 the decrease in dividends declared was due to a lower number of stock options and stock appreciation rights being exercised 

  

segment results of operations – 2010 vs 2009 

we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda adjusted oibda is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses excluding i marktomarket stockbased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii amortization of deferred launch incentives iv exit and restructuring charges v certain impairment charges and vi gains losses on business and asset dispositions we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses and also provides investors a measure to analyze the operating performance of each segment against historical data we exclude marktomarket stockbased compensation exit and restructuring charges certain impairment charges and gains losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income cash flows provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 

additionally certain corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon decisions made directly by segment executives additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k

 us networks 

the following table presents for our us networks segment revenues by type certain operating expenses contra revenue amounts adjusted oibda and a reconciliation of adjusted oibda to operating income in millions 

 

 revenues 

distribution revenues increased 69 million primarily due to annual contractual rate increases for fees charged to operators who distribute our networks an increase in paying subscribers principally for networks carried on the digital tier and decreased amortization of deferred launch incentives these increases were partially offset by an 18 million decrease for the effect of deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 

advertising revenues increased 140 million which was driven by increased pricing in the upfront and scatter markets higher sellouts and greater audience delivery reflecting the improved advertising market 

other revenues decreased 16 million which was attributable to lower affiliate and advertising sales representation services for thirdparty networks and commerce sales the decrease in affiliate and advertising sales representation services was the result of an agreement ending in may 2010 the decline in commerce sales was due to the transition of our commerce business model in early 2009 

  

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist primarily of content expense sales commissions and distribution costs increased 29 million the increase in costs of revenues was driven by higher content expense and sales commissions content expense increased 26 million due to continued investments in our programming sales commissions were 7 million higher due to improved advertising sales these increases were partially offset by a 7 million decrease for the effect of deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 and an 11 million decline due to the transition of our commerce business model in early 2009 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which principally comprise employee costs marketing costs research costs and occupancy and back office support fees increased 14 million increased selling general and administrative expenses were attributable to higher marketing costs which were partially offset by lower employee costs as a result of restructurings that eliminated certain positions 

adjusted oibda 

adjusted oibda increased 136 million primarily due to increased advertising sales growth in distribution revenues and lower employee costs these improvements were partially offset by increased content expense sales commissions and marketing costs as well as a decline in other revenues and a 10 million decrease for the effect of deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 

international networks 

the following table presents for our international networks segment revenues by type certain operating expenses contra revenue amounts adjusted oibda and a reconciliation of adjusted oibda to operating income in millions 

 

 revenues 

distribution revenues increased 44 million which was attributable to growth in the number of paying subscribers in latin america and an increase in average contractual rates for fees charged to operators who distribute our networks in the uk subscribers increased due to growth in pay television services in those regions these increases were partially offset by changes in our channel mix in emea changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact distribution revenues 

advertising revenues which increased 78 million were higher in all international regions in which we operate the increase in advertising revenues was driven by increased pricing in the uk advertising revenues also increased in latin america emea and asiapacific as a result of higher sellouts and audience delivery higher sellouts reflect improvements in the advertising market 

  

increased viewership was driven by growth in pay television services in international markets these increases were partially offset by the absence of a 6 million settlement of prior contract disputes in 2009 changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact advertising revenues 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist primarily of content expense distribution costs and sales commissions increased 2 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations cost of revenues increased 1 the increase in costs of revenues was due to higher sales commissions and license fees for music rights sales commissions increased 8 million due to improved advertising sales the increase in license fees for music rights was due to the absence of a 6 million reversal of liabilities in 2009 as a result of changes in estimates for amounts accrued in prior periods these increases were partially offset by a 4 million decline in content expense reflecting a decline in writeoffs 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which principally comprise employee costs marketing costs research costs and occupancy and back office support fees increased 19 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 increased selling general and administrative expenses were attributable to the international rollout of the tlc network expansion in eastern europe and investments in latin america which increased employee and marketing costs 

adjusted oibda 

adjusted oibda increased 100 million excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations adjusted oibda increased 20 primarily due to increased advertising sales growth in distribution revenues and lower content expense these improvements were partially offset by increased employee and marketing costs higher sales commissions and an increase in license fees for music rights 

education and other 

the following table presents for our education and other segment revenues by type certain operating expenses adjusted oibda and a reconciliation of adjusted oibda to operating loss income in millions 

 

 nm – not meaningful 

revenues 

other revenues increased 5 million primarily due to continued growth in subscriptions for access to an online streaming service that includes a suite of curriculumbased tools which was partially offset by a decline in postproduction audio services the decline in postproduction audio services was driven by the overall decline in the dvd marketplace 

  

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist principally of content expense and royalty payments were consistent between 2010 and 2009 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which principally comprise employee costs occupancy and back office support fees and marketing costs increased 5 million due to higher employee costs as a result of hiring additional personnel to support the growth in our education business

corporate and intersegment eliminations 

the following table presents for our unallocated corporate amounts revenues certain operating expenses adjusted oibda and a reconciliation of adjusted oibda to operating loss in millions 

 

 corporate operations primarily consist of executive management administrative support services substantially all of our stockbased compensation and a consolidated joint venture consistent with our segment reporting corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives 

other revenues and costs of revenues both declined 3 million as a result of lower dvd sales at a consolidated joint venture selling general and administrative expenses increased 22 million which was primarily attributable to a 17 million increase in stockbased compensation expense for equity settled awards such as stock options prsus and rsus that received fixed accounting the increase in stockbased compensation was driven by an increase in the number of outstanding awards and the fair value of awards granted during 2010 due to increases in the price of our series a common stock 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

our principal sources of cash are cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operating activities available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and access to capital markets as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 20 billion of total capital resources available comprised of 10 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately 10 billion available to borrow under our revolving credit facility as a public company we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets on june 17 2009 we filed a registration statement on form s3 “shelf registration” with the sec in which we registered securities including debt securities common stock and preferred stock on june 20 2011 dcl one of 

  

our subsidiaries issued 650 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due on june 15 2021 dcl received net proceeds of 641 million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and issuance costs in total we have issued approximately 42 billion of public senior notes under this shelf registration access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured 

on august 8 2011 dcl modified its 10 billion revolving credit agreement to extend the expiration date two years to october 12 2015 and to reduce interest rates and fees the terms of the arrangement are otherwise consistent with the previous arrangement 

our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content operating expenditures discretionary repurchases of stock income taxes interest funding to equity method investees capital expenditures and business acquisitions we believe our financial condition is sound and anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand cash generated by operating activities and cash available to us considered together should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 

we plan to continue to significantly invest in the creation and acquisition of new content additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in the section titled “commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” in this annual report on form 10k

we have interests in various equity method investees and provide funding to those equity method investees from time to time as of december 31 2011 we have an outstanding note receivable including interest accrued from own our equity method investee which totals 312 million we currently expect to provide significant additional funding to our equity method investees and expect to recoup amounts funded 

in 2012 we expect our uses of cash to include approximately 215 million for interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and capital lease obligations and approximately 60 million for capital expenditures we expect tax payments in 2012 to increase significantly as a result of the expiration of the tax law that allows for the immediate deduction of certain domestic programming costs additionally we expect to continue to make payments to settle vested cashsettled equity awards actual amounts expensed and payable for cashsettled awards are dependent on future calculations of fair value which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding during 2011 we paid 126 million for cashsettled equity awards as of december 31 2011 we accrued 37 million for outstanding cashsettled equity awards of which 27 million was classified as current

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 432 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased operating results a decrease in taxes paid a decrease in interest payments and decreases in stock compensation payments for cash settled equity awards during 2010 there was a 112 million overpayment of tax “2010 overpayment” resulting primarily from an extension of the tax law in the fourth quarter of 2010 that allowed for the immediate deduction of certain domestic programming costs during 2011 we received a 39 million tax refund related to the 2010 overpayment and there was a decrease in tax payments of 107 million primarily attributable to the use of the remaining overpayment carry forward from 2010 the decrease in interest payments was principally the result of 114 million of makewhole premiums paid in 2010 in connection with the refinancing of most of our outstanding debt the 32 million decrease in payments for cashsettled equity awards was attributable to the decrease in number of outstanding unit awards and sars these improvements were partially offset by a 110 million increase in cash used by operating activities attributable to investments in programming 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 26 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased earnings principally from increased advertising and distribution revenues at our us networks and international networks segments and a decrease of 49 million in tax payments principally due to a nonrecurring tax payment in 2009 related to the gain on the us discovery kids transaction these increases were partially offset by 114 million of makewhole premiums paid in connection with refinancing most of our outstanding debt in june 2010 and a 77 million increase in payments for cashsettled equity awards the increase in payments for cashsettled equity awards was attributable to the increase in fair value of outstanding awards due to the increase in the prices of our series a common stock and settlements of sars granted in late 2008 and early 2009 as part of a transition from an existing equity plan under which we typically granted cashsettled awards to a new equity plan under which we typically issue stocksettled awards

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 190 million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 238 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the decline in cash flows from investing activities was due to a decline in cash from business and investment dispositions an increase in cash used for business acquisitions and increased funding payments to unconsolidated ventures which were partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures cash used in investing activities during 2010 consisted of 127 million in funding to our unconsolidated network ventures payments of 49 million for property and equipment acquisitions and 35 million for the purchase of an uplink facility which were partially offset by net proceeds of 24 million related to the sale of our antenna audio business

cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 285 million compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2010 was driven by 29 billion of additional repayments made on term loans and private senior notes 605 million used during 2010 to repurchase shares of the company’s series c common and series c preferred stock and 148 million paid during 2010 for the acquisition of the remaining 50 ownership interest in the international animal planet and liv networks the increases in cash flows used in financing activities during 2010 were partially offset by 30 billion of additional debt offering proceeds received during 2010 38 million of additional proceeds received during 2010 for stock options exercised and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and a reduction of repayments made on revolver loans during 2010 since repayments totaled 315 million during 2009

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure therefore we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding 42 billion under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates additionally we have access to a 10 billion revolving credit facility with no amounts outstanding as of december 31 2011 if we were to draw on the revolving credit facility interest would be variable based on an underlying index rate the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors 

fixed and variable rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the interest rate or yield of fixed rate debt will impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the interest rate of variable debt will impact interest expense and the cash required to service such debt our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our outstanding indebtedness for fixed rate debt we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid for variable rate debt we may enter into fixed interest rate swaps to effectively fix the amount of interest paid in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings there were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2011 

as of december 31 2011 the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 46 billion the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 394 million as of december 31 2011 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates through december 31 2011 our international networks segment reported into the following four regions western europe ceemea asiapacific and latin america cash is managed from our four international regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings since earnings of our international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely we do not hedge our investment in the net assets of those foreign operations 

the functional currency of substantially all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency the financial statements of our foreign corporations are translated into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting as a result fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the british pound and the euro 

we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with the cost for producing or acquiring programming abroad these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows we did not hold any foreign currency derivative instruments at december 31 2011 

market values of investments 

we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method and highly liquid instruments such as mutual funds that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees were 807 million and the carrying values of investments in mutual funds totaled 711 million at december 31 2011 investments in mutual funds include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in interest rates would not materially impact the fair values of our investments in mutual funds as of december 31 2011

revenues generated by our digital media business are derived primarily from the sale of display banner rich media and video advertising sponsorships and subscriber fees for access to our content 

international networks 

our international networks segment principally consists of national and panregional television networks international networks generated net revenues of 13 billion during 2010 which represented 33 of our total consolidated net revenues this segment generates revenues primarily from fees charged to operators who distribute our networks which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers and from advertising sold on our television networks and websites our international networks segment also generates revenues from license and program access fees for our content for 2010 distribution advertising and other revenues were 61 34 and 5 respectively of total net revenues for this segment

subsequent to this transaction we wholly own and operate most of our international television networks except for certain networks in japan and canada which are operated by ventures with strategically important local partners 

through december 31 2010 international networks’ regional operations reported into four regions united kingdom “uk” europe excluding the uk middle east and africa “emea” asiapacific and latin america effective january 1 2011 international networks reporting structure was realigned into the following four regions western europe which includes the uk and western european countries central and eastern europe middle east and africa “ceemea” latin america and asiapacific 

international television markets vary in their stages of development some such as western europe are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result primarily from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in relatively mature markets such as western europe the growth dynamic is changing increased market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets instead growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay television networks and launching new services either in pay television or free television environments 

our international networks segment owns and operates the following television networks 

 

 international networks also distributes specialized networks developed for individual regions and markets to 226 million cumulative subscribers which include such networks as real time turbo and discovery world discovery history shed and quest in the uk discovery civilization and liv in latin america in addition international networks distributes two spanishlanguage networks in the us discovery en español and discovery familia which are distributed to 11 million cumulative subscribers 

our international networks segment also includes network branded websites revenues generated by the branded websites are derived from the sale of display banner rich media and video advertising and sponsorships 

on september 1 2010 we sold our antenna audio business for net cash proceeds of 24 million which resulted in a 9 million gain net of taxes antenna audio provides audio multimedia and mobile tours for museums exhibitions historic sites and visitor attractions around the world

our education and other segment primarily includes the sale of curriculumbased product and service offerings and postproduction audio services education and other generated net revenues of 153 million during 2010 which represented 4 of our total consolidated net revenues this segment generates revenues from subscriptions charged to public and private k12 schools for access to an online vod service that includes a suite of curriculumbased tools student assessment and professional development services publication of hardcopy curriculumbased content and postproduction audio services 

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers substantially all content is sourced from a wide range of thirdparty producers which includes some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies with which we have developed longstanding 

  

relationships as well as independent producers our production arrangements fall into three categories produced coproduced and licensed substantially all produced content includes programming which we engage third parties to develop and produce while we retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights in exchange for paying all development and production costs coproduced content refers to programs for which we collaborate with third parties to finance develop and distribute while we retain significant rights to exploit the programs the rights retained by us are generally in proportion to the total project costs we pay or incur which generally ranges from 35 to 75 of the total project cost coproduced programs are typically highcost projects for which neither we nor our coproducers wish to bear the entire cost or productions in which the producer has already taken on an international broadcast partner licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been previously produced by third parties 

our international networks segment maximizes the use of shared programming from our us networks segment much of our content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result a significant amount of our programming translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages our programming can be reedited and updated in a costeffective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world we also provide local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences which is typically produced through thirdparty production companies 

revenues 

we generate revenues principally from i fees charged to operators who distribute our networks which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers ii advertising sold on our networks websites and other digital media services and iii other transactions including curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services for thirdparty networks content licenses postproduction audio services and the licensing of our brands for consumer products no single customer represented more than 10 of our total consolidated revenues for 2010 2009 or 2008 

distribution 

typically our television networks are aired pursuant to multiyear carriage agreements with cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other television distributors these carriage agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and package inclusion whether on more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages and for scheduled and if applicable graduated annual rate increases for fees paid to us the amount of fees that we earn is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks as well as competition and the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide as an incentive to obtain longterm distribution agreements for our newer networks we may make cash payments to distributors to carry the network “launch incentives” provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time or both we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors in the us over 90 of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times in 2012 through 2020 outside of the us less than 50 of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year 

advertising 

our advertising revenues consist of consumer advertising which is sold primarily on a national basis in the us and on a panregional or locallanguage feed basis outside the us advertising contracts generally have terms of one year or less 

in the us advertising revenues are a function of the size and demographics of the audience delivered quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular programming the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies such as nielsen media research as well as overall advertiser demand in the marketplace we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions 

outside the us advertising is sold based on a fixed rate for the spot in certain markets and sold based on viewership in other markets advertisers buy advertising time closer to the time when the commercials will be run 

revenues from advertising are subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters revenues can also fluctuate due to the popularity of particular programs 

  

and viewership ratings in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that typically require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved 

we also generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our online properties we sell advertising on our websites both on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

other 

subscriptions to our curriculumbased streaming services are primarily sold at the beginning of each school year as school budgets are appropriated and approved substantially all revenues derived from the subscription agreements are recognized ratably over the school year 

revenues from postproduction audio services are recognized using the milestone method 

competition 

television network programming is a highly competitive business in the us and worldwide we experience competition in the development and acquisition of content for the distribution of our programming for the selling of commercial time on our networks and for viewers our networks compete with studios television networks and other forms of media such as dvds and the internet for the acquisition of programming and creative talent such as writers producers and directors our ability to produce and acquire popular programming is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our networks attracting viewers and the sale of commercial time our success in securing popular programming and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing programming that targets the same genre and audience the distribution of our networks viewership and the price production marketing and advertising support we provide 

our networks compete with other television networks including broadcast cable and local for the distribution of our programming and fees charged to cable television operators dth satellite service providers and other distributors that carry our network programming our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to our audiences our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business growth in the number of networks distributed consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our programming that is as favorable as those currently in place the ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production acquisition and packaging of original programming viewership the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors and the prices charged for carriage 

our networks and websites compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks including broadcast cable and local online and mobile outlets radio programming and print media our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our viewers quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network the perceived quality of the network and of the particular programming the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace 

our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided to viewers including broadcast cable and local networks payperview and videoondemand services dvds online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment 

our education business also operates in highly competitive industries which competes with other providers of curriculumbased products to schools including providers with longstanding relationships such as scholastic our postproduction audio services business competes with other production and inhouse sound companies 

  

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming websites and other content trademarks in brands names and logos domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content are of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not always prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of our intellectual property we seek to limit that threat through a combination of approaches 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses both the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our programming including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of local countries and international bodies such as the european union programming networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators affect programming networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest under fcc rules such as those owned by us from entering into exclusive contracts for programming with a cable operator and from discriminating among competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” in the price terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of programming these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against program suppliers if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to programming on nondiscriminatory terms 

“mustcarry”retransmission consent 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 the “act” imposed “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market direct broadcast satellite “dbs” systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules the fcc’s implementation of “mustcarry” obligations requires cable operators and dbs providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable operators and dbs providers the act also established retransmission consent which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require consent from mvpds before distributing its signal to their subscribers broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their musthave broadcast programming to obtain carriage for their affiliated cable networks increasingly broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their musthave broadcast programming such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the programming funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters such as us 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions on children’s programming 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of programming for the hearing impaired and our programming and websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising 

  

regulation of the internet 

we operate several websites which we use to distribute information about and supplement our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal child online protection act and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 4200 employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our whollyowned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures there were approximately 250 personnel at our postproduction audio services business subject to collective bargaining agreements there are no active grievances strikes or work stoppages and we believe our relations with our union and nonunion employees are strong we do not believe a dispute with employees subject to collective bargaining agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business

 item 1a risk factors tableend investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

our business could be adversely affected by an economic downturn 

any economic downturn in the us and in other regions of the world in which we operate could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenues and earnings we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on our networks expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns the current economic conditions and any continuation of these adverse conditions may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities a decrease in advertising expenditures would have an adverse effect on our business the decline in economic conditions has impacted consumer discretionary spending a continued reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television subscriptions particularly to the more expensive digital service tiers which could lead to a decrease in our distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for advertising 

our success is dependent upon us and foreign audience acceptance of our programming and other entertainment content which is difficult to predict 

the production and distribution of pay television programs and other entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content and programming that meet the changing preferences of viewers in general viewers in special interest groups viewers in specific demographic categories and viewers in various international marketplaces the commercial success of our programming and other content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing programs and other content available in the applicable marketplace at the same time other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy 

  

digital and ondemand distribution and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both i the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and ii the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect all of our revenue streams 

the loss of our affiliation agreements or renewals with less advantageous terms could cause our revenue to decline 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks these persubscriber payments represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies from market to market and from distributor to distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are as favorable to us as those in effect today a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us in the us over 90 of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times beginning in 2012 through 2020 a failure to secure a renewal or a renewal on less favorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected in addition many of the international countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our programming and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue 

we operate in increasingly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals and online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers in addition there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the enormously broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our curriculumbased video business competes with other providers of education products to schools our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewership with appealing categoryspecific programming adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations both domestic and foreign 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other mvpds are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video programming business see the discussion under “business — regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators 

  

or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other programming services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a country by country basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

increased programming production and content costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

one of our most significant areas of expense is the production and licensing of content in connection with creating original content we incur production costs associated with among other things acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative talent including writers and producers the costs of producing programming have generally increased in recent years these costs may continue to increase in the future which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition costs associated with 3d programming both in production and in distribution are expected to be significantly higher than those for both standard and hd television which may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

disruption or failure of satellites and facilities and disputes over supplier contracts on which we depend to distribute our programming could adversely affect our business 

we depend on transponders on satellite systems to transmit our media networks to cable television operators and other distributors worldwide the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks we obtain satellite transponder capacity pursuant to longterm contracts and other arrangements with thirdparty vendors which expire at various times through 2022 even with backup and redundant systems transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters or other conditions that may impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption or failure occurs we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we must respond to and capitalize on rapid changes in new technologies and distribution platforms including their effect on consumer behavior in order to remain competitive and exploit new opportunities 

technology in the video telecommunications and data services industry is changing rapidly we must adapt to advances in technologies distribution outlets and content transfer and storage to ensure that our content remains desirable and widely available to our audiences while protecting our intellectual property interests we may not have the right and may not be able to secure the right to distribute some of our licensed content across these or any other new platforms and must adapt accordingly the ability to anticipate and take advantage of new and future sources of revenue from these technological developments will affect our ability to expand our business and increase revenue 

similarly we also must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by technological advances such as time shifts and a desire for more interactive content devices that allow consumers to view our entertainment content from remote locations or on a timedelayed basis and technologies which enable users to fastforward or skip advertisements may cause changes in audience behavior that could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenue if we cannot ensure that our content is responsive to the viewing preferences of our target audiences and capitalize on technological advances there could be a negative effect on our business 

we continue to develop new products and services for evolving markets there can be no assurance of the success of these efforts due to a number of factors some of which are beyond our control 

there are substantial uncertainties associated with our efforts to develop new products and services for evolving markets and substantial investments may be required initial timetables for the introduction and development of new products and services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as the development of competitive alternatives rapid technological change regulatory changes and shifting market preferences may cause new markets to move in unanticipated directions 

  

risks associated with our international operations could harm our financial condition 

our networks are offered worldwide inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include among other things longer payment cycles foreign taxation and currency exchange risk as we continue to expand the provision of our products and services to international markets we cannot assure you whether these risks and uncertainties will harm our results of operations 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by export and import restrictions other trade barriers and acts of disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that are critical to international businesses due to expropriation nationalization war insurrection terrorism or general social or political unrest or other hostilities 

the loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our operations could be adversely affected 

piracy of our entertainment content including digital piracy may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our business and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands dvds cable television and other programming digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly adversely affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content 

financial market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

the recent changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 36 billion of consolidated debt including capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

  

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreements for our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

we are a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions in our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject

 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us

business overview 

we are a global nonfiction media and entertainment company that provides programming across multiple distribution platforms with over 120 television networks offering customized programming in over 40 languages in the us and over 180 other countries and territories our global portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel one of the first nonfiction networks and our most widely distributed global brand tlc animal planet science channel and investigation discovery 

  

we also have a diversified portfolio of websites and other digital media services develop and sell curriculumbased products and services and provide postproduction audio services 

in the us we own and operate nine fully distributed networks we also have interests in own oprah winfrey network “own” and the hub which are networks operated as 5050 ventures our objective is to invest in content for these networks to build viewership optimize distribution revenue and capture advertising sales and to create or reposition additional branded channels and businesses that can sustain longterm growth and occupy a desired programming niche with strong consumer appeal 

outside of the us we have one of the largest and most extensive international distribution platforms with two to thirteen channels in more than 180 countries and territories our objective is to maintain a leadership position in nonfiction entertainment in international markets and build additional branded channels and businesses that can sustain longterm growth in 2010 we began the international rollout of tlc as a femaletargeted global flagship brand to complement discovery channel which is a leading malefocused brand in most markets throughout the world the tlc network was launched in over 30 countries and territories in europe and asia in 2010 with additional launches planned for 2011 

our strategy is to optimize the distribution ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded networks we are extending content distribution across new distribution platforms including brandaligned websites mobile devices videoondemand “vod” and broadband channels which provide promotional platforms for our television programming and serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales 

our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators directtohome “dth” satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers 

we classify our operations in three segments us networks consisting principally of domestic cable and satellite television networks websites and other digital media services international networks consisting primarily of international cable and satellite television networks and websites and education and other consisting principally of curriculumbased product and service offerings and postproduction audio services 

effective january 1 2010 we realigned our commerce business which sells and licenses discovery branded merchandise from the commerce education and other reporting segment into the us networks reporting segment in order to better align the management of our online properties in connection with this realignment we changed the name of our commerce education and other reporting segment to education and other the information for periods prior to 2010 in this annual report on form 10k has been recast to reflect the realignment 

we were formed in connection with discovery holding company “dhc” and advancenewhouse programming partnership “advancenewhouse” combining their respective ownership interests in discovery communications holding llc “dch” and exchanging those interests with and into discovery which was consummated on september 17 2008 the “discovery formation” prior to the discovery formation dch was a standalone private company which was owned approximately 66 2  3  by dhc and 33 1  3  by advancenewhouse as a result of this transaction we became the successor reporting entity to dhc under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended additional information regarding the discovery formation is set forth in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k information in this annual report on form 10k is presented as though the discovery formation was consummated on january 1 2008 

us networks 

us networks which is our largest segment owns and operates nine national television networks principally throughout the us including prominent television brands such as discovery channel tlc and animal planet as well as a portfolio of websites and other digital media services through december 31 2010 we also owned and operated the discovery health network on january 1 2011 we contributed the discovery health network including affiliate relationships with cable operators and cable satellite providers content licenses and website user information to own which is a 5050 venture we formed with harpo inc “harpo” in 2008 effective with the contribution the network was rebranded and is now operated by the venture our results of operations included the gross revenues and expenses related to the discovery health network through december 31 2010 we account for our interest in the own venture using the equity method of accounting therefore effective with the contribution on january 1 2011 the gross revenues and expenses related to the discovery health network are no longer consolidated in our operating results through december 31 2010 we recognized 100 of own’s net losses in our results of operations beginning january 1 2011 any future net losses generated by own will be allocated to us and harpo based on our proportionate ownership interests which were 5050 on january 1 

  

2011 any future net income generated by own will initially be allocated to us up to the amount of net losses we previously recognized prior to the contributions any excess net income generated by own will be allocated to us and harpo based on our proportionate ownership interests as a result of our contribution and subsequent deconsolidation of the discovery health network we may recognize a nonrecurring gain or loss during the quarter ending march 31 2011 for the difference between the fair values and book values of our retained interests in the assets we contributed as of the time of filing this annual report on form 10k determination of the fair value of the contributed assets has not been completed 

us networks also owns an interest in the hub a 5050 venture between us and hasbro inc “hasbro” on may 22 2009 we sold a 50 interest in the us discovery kids network to hasbro the “us discovery kids transaction” both parties then contributed their interests in the us discovery kids network to the newly formed venture upon which we no longer consolidate the network in our operating results the network continued to operate as the discovery kids network until october 10 2010 at which time it was rebranded as the hub we account for our interest in the hub using the equity method of accounting 

us networks derives revenues primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales which comprised 44 and 52 of revenues for this segment for 2010 respectively during 2010 discovery channel tlc and animal planet collectively generated 75 of us networks’ total revenues us networks earns distribution fees under multiyear affiliation agreements with cable operators dth satellite operators and other distributors of television programming distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving our programming upon the launch of a new channel we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel “launch incentives” or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time launch incentives are amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of revenues over the term of the affiliation agreement us networks generates advertising revenues by selling commercial time on our networks and websites the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising revenue 

us networks’ largest single cost is the cost of programming including production costs for original programming us networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that current estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives 

international networks 

outside of the us we have one of the largest international distribution platforms with two to thirteen channels in more than 180 countries and territories around the world international networks owns and operates a portfolio of television networks led by discovery channel and animal planet which are distributed in virtually every paytelevision market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in london singapore and miami in 2010 we began the international rollout of tlc as a femaletargeted global flagship which was launched in over 30 countries and territories in europe and asia in 2010 with additional launches planned for 2011 

through december 31 2010 international networks’ regional operations reported into four regions united kingdom “uk” europe excluding the uk middle east and africa “emea” asiapacific and latin america effective january 1 2011 international networks reporting structure was realigned into the following four regions western europe which includes the uk and western european countries central and eastern europe middle east and africa “ceemea” latin america and asiapacific at december 31 2010 international networks operated over 130 unique distribution feeds in over 40 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities 

in november 2010 we acquired the remaining 50 interest in substantially all of the international animal planet and liv formerly people  arts networks from venture partner bbc worldwide for 152 million giving us 100 ownership of these networks previously these networks were operated as 5050 ventures between us and bbc worldwide the ventures qualified as variable interest entities pursuant to certain accounting standards and we concluded we were the primary beneficiary accordingly we consolidated the animal planet and liv networks prior to this transaction as we previously consolidated these ventures the acquisition did not impact our results of operations with this acquisition we wholly own and operate most of our international television networks except for various channels in japan and canada which are operated by ventures with strategically important local partners additional information regarding the acquisition of the interests in the international animal planet and liv ventures is disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this annual report on form 10k 

similar to our us networks segment the primary sources of revenues for international networks are distribution fees and advertising sales and the primary cost is programming international networks executes a localization strategy by offering shared programming with us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds for 2010 distribution 

  

revenues represented approximately 61 of the segment’s operating revenues international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital advertising sales are also important to the segment’s financial success representing 34 of the segment’s total revenues for 2010 

in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in relatively mature markets such as western europe the growth dynamic is changing increased market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets instead growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay television networks and launching new services either in pay television or free television environments 

international networks’ largest cost is for programming our international networks segment maximizes the use of shared programming from our us networks segment we also provide local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences such programming is shared from our us networks segment or acquired through third party production companies through production coproduction or license arrangements international networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that current estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives

our consolidated results of operation for 2010 and 2009 were as follows in millions 

 

 nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenues increased 109 million which was driven by contractual rate increases subscriber growth and reduced amortization of deferred launch incentives these increases were partially offset by an 18 million decline for the effect of deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 and changes in our channel mix in emea changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not significantly impact distribution revenues 

  

advertising revenues increased 218 million which was attributable to increased pricing higher inventory utilization and greater audience delivery these increases were partially offset by the absence of a 6 million settlement of a prior contract dispute in 2009 and 2 million of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

other revenues decreased 12 million as a result of an affiliate and advertising sales representation agreement ending in may 2010 transitioning our commerce business model in early 2009 and lower dvd sales at a consolidated venture these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of subscriptions to our online curriculumbased education tools other revenues were not significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist primarily of content expense production costs distribution costs and sales commissions increased 29 million the increase in costs of revenues was due to higher content expense sales commissions and license fees for music rights content expense increased 14 million reflecting our continued investment in programming sales commissions increased 17 million due to improved advertising sales the increase in license fees for music rights was due to the absence of a 6 million reversal of liabilities recorded in 2009 as a result of changes in estimates for amounts accrued in prior periods these increases were partially offset by a 7 million decrease for the effect of deconsolidating the us discovery kids network in may 2009 an 11 million decline due to the transition of our commerce business model in early 2009 lower costs related to dvd sales and a 4 million benefit from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which principally comprise employee costs marketing costs research costs and occupancy and back office support fees decreased 3 million the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses was attributable to a decline in stockbased compensation and a 9 million benefit from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates stockbased compensation decreased 46 million driven by a decline in the number of outstanding cashsettled awards which was partially offset by an increase in the fair value of outstanding awards and an increase in the number of stocksettled awards these decreases were partially offset by higher marketing and personnel costs due to increased promotion of our programs expanded distribution of our international networks and growth in our education business 

the most significant portion of our stockbased compensation expense for 2010 and 2009 was related to cashsettled awards we do not intend to grant additional cashsettled awards except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries in which personnel are not allowed to receive or hold rights to receive ownership interests additionally prsus and rsus became a more significant component of the compensation to certain executives accordingly awards such as stock options prsus and rsus continue to become a more significant portion of our outstanding awards additional information regarding the accounting for our stockbased awards is disclosed in note 2 and note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 22 million the decrease was due primarily to lower property and equipment and finitelived intangible asset balances which was attributable to certain assets becoming fully amortized and impairment charges recorded in prior periods 

restructuring and impairment charges 

in 2010 we recorded 25 million of restructuring and impairment charges which was comprised of 14 million of exit and restructuring charges and an 11 million noncash impairment charge exit and restructuring charges for 2010 related to the realignment of our reporting regions at our international networks segment cost reduction initiatives in the us and the contribution of the discovery health network to own the charges primarily consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions and contract termination and other associated costs the goodwill impairment charge was due to lower than expected operating performance at our postproduction audio business which is a component of our education and other segment 

during 2009 we recorded 52 million of restructuring and impairment charges which consisted of 26 million related to exit and restructuring charges and 26 million of noncash impairment charges the exit and restructuring charges incurred during 2009 related to realignments of portions of our operations to better align our organizational structure with our strategic priorities the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model and cost reduction initiatives the realignment reflected changes to our organizational structure in an effort to centralize certain functions that were previously performed by various departments the charges consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions and contract termination and other associated costs the impairment charges related to certain intangible assets and software at our us networks and international networks segments 

  

gains on dispositions

loss on extinguishment of debt 

in june 2010 we refinanced most of our outstanding debt in connection with the repayment of 29 billion of existing debt outstanding under our term loans and private senior notes we recognized a 136 million loss on extinguishment of debt which included 114 million for makewhole premiums 12 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs and 10 million for the repayment of the original issue discount from our term loans

provision for income taxes 

for 2010 and 2009 our provisions for income taxes were 288 million and 469 million and the effective tax rates were 31 and 45 respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2010 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to the reversal of a 28 million foreign tax reserve as a result of a foreign tax authority completing its tax audit and providing us notification that certain tax years will not be adjusted and production activity deductions which were partially offset by state taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to a permanent difference on the 252 million gain from the us discovery kids transaction and state income taxes which were partially offset by deductions for domestic production activities and the release of a valuation allowance of 12 million

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

our principal sources of cash are cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operating activities available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and access to capital markets as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 15 billion of total capital resources available comprised of 454 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand excluding amounts held by consolidated ventures and approximately 10 billion available to borrow under our revolving credit facility 

as a public company we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets on june 17 2009 we filed a registration statement on form s3 “shelf registration” with the us securities and exchange commission in which we registered securities including debt securities common stock and preferred stock we have issued 35 billion of public senior notes under this shelf registration access to sufficient capital in these markets is not assured and is dependent on the current equity and credit markets 

we took advantage of a decrease in interest rates available in the capital markets to extend our debt maturities by refinancing most of our outstanding debt in june 2010 on june 3 2010 dcl issued 30 billion of senior notes with amounts maturing in june 2015 2020 and 2040 interest on the senior notes is payable on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on december 1 2010 we used the net proceeds of the offering plus cash on hand to repay 29 billion outstanding under our term loans and privately held senior notes prior to maturity the repayments resulted in a pretax loss on extinguishment of debt of 136 million which included 114 million for makewhole premiums 12 million of noncash writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing costs and 10 million for the repayment of the original issue discount on our term loans 

  

on october 13 2010 we entered into a new 10 billion revolving credit facility that expires in october 2013 if we were to experience a significant decline in operating performance or have to meet an unanticipated need for additional capital beyond our available commitments there is no certainty that we would be able to access the needed capital covenants in our revolving credit facility may constrain our capacity for additional debt although our leverage and interest coverage covenants limit the total amount of debt we might incur relative to our operating cash flow we would continue to maintain compliance with our borrowing covenants with a 50 reduction in our current operating performance as defined in the credit agreement we were in compliance with all covenants and customary provisions and there were no events of default as of december 31 2010 

our primary uses of cash have been the repayment of outstanding borrowings debt and related interest the creation and acquisition of new content operating expenditures repurchases of stock funding to ventures and business acquisitions we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand cash generated by operating activities and available to us should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 

we plan to continue to significantly invest in the creation and acquisition of new content additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in the section titled “commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition” in this annual report on form 10k 

on august 3 2010 we implemented a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to 10 billion of our common stock we expect to fund repurchases through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions under the program management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to stock price business conditions market conditions and other factors the repurchase program does not have an expiration date during 2010 we repurchased 299 million shares of our series c common stock for 105 million through open market transactions the repurchases were funded using cash on hand as of december 31 2010 we had remaining authorization of 895 million for future repurchases of common stock the 105 million aggregate purchase price of the acquired stock was recorded in a separate account as a reduction of equity we repurchased an additional 258 million shares of our series c common stock for 89 million from january 1 2011 through february 8 2011 

on december 13 2010 we repurchased and retired approximately 1373 million shares of our series c convertible preferred stock from advancenewhouse for an aggregate purchase price of 500 million the repurchase was made outside of our publicly announced stock repurchase program the 500 million aggregate purchase price was recorded as a decrease of 100000 to par value 234 million to additional paidin capital and 266 million to retained earnings because the additional paidin capital related to the series of shares repurchased was reduced to zero 

we have interests in various ventures pursuant to venture arrangements as of december 31 2010 we are committed to fund up to 234 million of which 165 million had been funded in august 2010 the own venture agreement was amended which among other matters increased our funding commitment to own from 100 million to 189 million the funding will be in the form of a revolving loan from dcl andor debt financing from a thirdparty lender to own as of december 31 2010 we have funded 156 million to own including interest accrued on outstanding borrowings we currently expect to finance any additional funding needs for own through member loans based on own’s currently anticipated expenses and projected budget for 2011 we believe that its funding needs for 2011 in excess of our funding commitments could be approximately 50 million excluding accrued interest we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet funding needs under our obligations and any additional own member loans we determine to make in 2011 we expect to recoup the amounts funded provided that the ventures are profitable and have sufficient funds to repay us 

in 2011 we expect our uses of cash to include approximately 200 million for interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness periodic derivative payments and capital lease obligations and approximately 50 million for capital expenditures we expect tax payments in 2011 to decrease as a result of the extension of the tax law that allows for the immediate deduction of certain domestic programming costs additionally we expect to continue to make payments to settle vested cashsettled equity awards actual amounts expensed and payable for cashsettled awards are dependent on future calculations of fair value which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding during 2010 we paid 158 million for cashsettled equity awards as of december 31 2010 we accrued 125 million for outstanding cashsettled equity awards of which 118 million was classified as current

 changes in cash and cash equivalents include amounts related to discontinued operations 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 increased by 26 million as compared to 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by increased earnings principally from increased advertising and distribution revenues at our us networks and international networks segments and a decrease of 49 million in tax payments principally due to a nonrecurring tax payment in 2009 related to the gain on the us discovery kids transaction these increases were partially offset by 114 million of makewhole premiums paid in connection with refinancing most of our outstanding debt in june 2010 and a 77 million increase in payments for cashsettled equity awards the increase in payments for cashsettled equity awards was attributable to the increase in fair value of outstanding awards due to the increase in the prices of our series a common stock and settlements of sars granted in late 2008 and early 2009 as part of a transition from an existing equity plan under which we typically granted cashsettled awards to a new equity plan under which we typically issue stocksettled awards 

for 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 69 million as compared to 2008 increased cash provided by operating activities was due principally to increased earnings driven by increased distribution and advertising revenues at our us networks and international networks segments and to a lesser extent lower payments for content rights and the timing of payment of our operating liabilities these increases were partially offset by increased tax payments primarily nonrecurring tax payments in 2009 related to the gain on the us discovery kids transaction and higher payments for cashsettled equity awards due to the increase in fair value of outstanding awards due to the increase in the prices of our series a common stock 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for 2010 was 190 million as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 238 million for 2009 the decline in cash flows from investing activities was due to a decline in cash from business and investment dispositions an increase in cash used for business acquisitions and increased funding payments to unconsolidated ventures which were partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures cash used in investing activities during 2010 consisted of 127 million in funding to our unconsolidated network ventures payments of 49 million for property and equipment acquisitions and 35 million for the purchase of an uplink facility which were partially offset by net proceeds of 24 million related to the sale of our antenna audio business cash provided by investing activities for 2009 principally includes a 300 million nonrecurring payment received in connection with the us discovery kids transaction and 24 million in proceeds from the sale of investments which were partially offset by 55 million of property and equipment acquisitions and 31 million in funding to our unconsolidated ventures the increase in funding to ventures was due to additional costs for selling general and administrative expenses and content development related to the launch of own on january 1 2011 

net cash provided by investing activities for 2009 increased by 150 million as compared to 2008 the increase in cash flows from investing activities was due to increased proceeds from business dispositions and a decrease in capital expenditures which were partially offset with cash received in connection with our formation in 2008 and increased funding payments to unconsolidated ventures cash provided by investing activities for 2008 primarily reflects 139 million from the dispositions of accenthealth amsts and certain buildings and equipment which were components of amc 39 million received from dhc in connection with our formation on september 17 2008 and 24 million in proceeds from the sale of investments which were partially offset by 102 million of property and equipment acquisitions the increase in funding to ventures was due to additional costs for selling general and

for 2009 net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of 10 billion of term loans and 315 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility which were partially offset by borrowings and debt issuances for which we received net proceeds of 970 million and 28 million of proceeds from stock option exercises

significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to consolidation of vies accounting for acquisitions dispositions allowances for doubtful accounts content rights asset impairments redeemable noncontrolling interests fair value measurements revenue recognition depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation income taxes and contingencies 

  

revenue recognition 

we generate revenues principally from i fees charged to operators who distribute our networks which primarily include cable and dth satellite service providers ii advertising sold on our networks websites and other digital media services and iii other transactions including curriculumbased products and services affiliate and advertising sales representation services for thirdparty networks content licenses postproduction audio services and the licensing of our brands for consumer products 

general 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery occurs or services are rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured distribution revenues are reported net of remittance of sales tax value added tax and other taxes collected from customers however distribution revenues are inclusive of foreign withholding income tax revenue recognition for each source of revenue is also based on the following policies 

distribution 

cable operators satellite service providers and other distributors typically pay a persubscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming under the terms of distribution contracts “distribution revenues” the majority of our distribution fees are collected monthly throughout the year distribution revenues are recognized over the term of the contracts including any free periods based on contracted programming rates and reported subscriber levels the amount of distribution revenues due to us is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period in such cases reported distribution revenues are based upon our estimate of the number of subscribers receiving our programming for periods which the distributor has not yet reported our subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor we subsequently adjust our estimated amounts based upon the actual amount of subscribers historical differences between actual amounts and estimates have not been material 

distribution revenues are recognized net of incentives we provide to operators in exchange for carrying our networks incentives typically include cash payments to operators “launch incentives” providing the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time or both launch incentives are capitalized as assets upon launch of our network by the operator and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract including free periods in instances where the distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of the original term we evaluate the economics of the extended term and if it is determined that the launch asset continues to benefit us over the extended term then we will adjust the amortization period of the remaining launch incentives accordingly other incentives are recognized as a reduction of revenue as incurred amortization of launch incentives was 42 million 55 million and 75 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

advertising 

advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on television networks advertising revenues are recognized net of agency commissions in the period advertising spots are aired 

a substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the us guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach revenues are recognized for the actual audience level delivered we provide the advertiser with additional advertising spots in future periods if the guaranteed audience level is not delivered revenues are deferred for any shortfall in the audience level until such time as the required audience level is delivered audience guarantees are initially developed internally based on planned programming historical audience levels the success of pilot programs and market trends in the us actual audience and delivery information is published by independent ratings services in certain instances the independent ratings information is not received until after the close of the reporting period in these cases reported advertising revenue and related deferred revenue is based upon our estimate of the audience level delivered using the most current data available from the independent ratings service we subsequently adjust our estimated amounts based upon the actual audience delivered historical differences between actual amounts and estimates have not been material 

advertising revenues from online properties are recognized either as impressions are delivered or the services are performed 

other 

revenues for curriculumbased services are recognized ratably over the contract term revenues from postproduction audio services are recognized using the milestone method 

  

deferred revenues 

deferred revenues primarily consist of amounts received for television advertising for which the advertising spots have not yet aired and advanced billings to subscribers for access to our curriculum based streaming services the amounts classified as current are expected to be earned within the next year 

content rights 

content rights principally consist of television series and television specials content aired on our television networks is primarily obtained through thirdparty production companies and is classified either as produced coproduced or licensed substantially all produced content includes programming for which we have engaged third parties to develop and produce but we own most or all rights coproduced content refers to programs for which we collaborate with third parties to finance develop and distribute and we retain significant rights to exploit the programs licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been previously produced by third parties capitalized content costs are stated at the lower of cost less accumulated amortization or net realizable value 

costs of produced and coproduced content consist of development costs acquired production costs direct production costs certain production overhead costs and participation costs costs incurred for produced and coproduced content are capitalized if we have previously generated revenues from similar content in established markets and the content will be used and revenues will be generated for a period of at least one year our coproduction arrangements generally represent the sharing of production cost we record our costs but do not record the costs borne by the other party as we do not share any associated economics of exploitation program licenses typically have fixed terms and require payments during the term of the license the cost of licensed content is capitalized when the programs become available for airing development costs for programs that we have determined will not be produced are written off additionally distribution advertising marketing general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 

amortization of content rights is recognized based on the proportion that current estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues which results in either an accelerated method or a straightline method over the estimated useful lives amortization of capitalized costs for produced and coproduced content begins when a program has been aired amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the program is available for use 

we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of content by considering expected future revenue generation estimates of future revenues consider historical airing patterns and future plans for airing content including any changes in strategy estimated future revenues can change based upon market acceptance network affiliate fee rates and advertising the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving our networks and program usage accordingly we review revenue estimates and planned usage and revise our assumptions if necessary if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected a writedown to net realizable value may be required 

all produced and coproduced content is classified as longterm the portion of the unamortized licensed content balance that will be amortized within one year is classified as a current asset 

stockbased compensation 

we have incentive plans under which unit awards stock appreciation rights “sars” stock options performance based restricted stock units “prsus” and service based restricted stock units “rsus” are issued 

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for unit awards and sars based on the fair value of the award less estimated forfeitures because unit awards and sars are cashsettled we remeasure the fair value of these awards each reporting period until settlement compensation expense including changes in fair value for unit awards and sars is recognized during the vesting period in proportion to the requisite service that has been rendered as of the reporting date for grants of unit awards with graded vesting we measure fair value and record compensation expense for all vesting tranches as a single award for grants of sars with graded vesting we measure fair value and record compensation expense separately for each vesting tranche changes in the fair value of outstanding unit awards and sars that occur between the vesting date and settlement date are recorded as adjustments to compensation costs in the period in which the changes occur 

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant less estimated forfeitures compensation expense for stock options is recognized ratably during the vesting period 

the fair values of unit awards sars and stock options are estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model because the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions changes in these assumptions can materially affect the 

  

fair value of awards for unit awards and sars the expected term is the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the award for stock options the expected term is estimated to be the period from the date of grant through the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical realized volatility of our common stock and considers other factors deemed relevant the dividend yield is assumed to be 0 because we have no present intention to pay dividends the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award 

vesting for certain prsus is subject to satisfying objective operating performance conditions while vesting for other prsus is based on the achievement of a combination of objective and subjective operating performance conditions compensation expense for prsus that vest based on achieving objective operating performance conditions is measured based on the fair value of our series a common stock on the date of grant less estimated forfeitures compensation expense for prsus that vest based on achieving subjective operating performance conditions is remeasured at fair value of our series a common stock each reporting period until the date of vesting less estimated forfeitures compensation expense for all prsus is recognized ratably during the vesting period only when it is probable that the operating performance conditions will be achieved we record a cumulative adjustment to compensation expense for prsus if there is a change in the determination of whether or not it is probable the operating performance conditions will be achieved 

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for rsus based on the fair value of our series a common stock on the date of grant less estimated forfeitures compensation expense for rsus is recognized ratably during the vesting period 

when recording compensation cost for stockbased awards we are required to estimate the number of awards granted that are expected to be forfeited in estimating forfeitures we consider historical and expected forfeiture rates and future events when such information is known on an ongoing basis we adjust compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revise the forfeiture rate as necessary 

stockbased compensation expense is recorded as a component of “selling general and administrative” expense we classify as a current liability the intrinsic value of unit awards and sars that are vested or will become vested within one year 

excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options and vested rsus and prsus are reported as cash inflows from financing activities rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows

we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally an operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the first step we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using a combination of a discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis and marketbased valuation methodologies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our budget longterm business plan and our recent operating performance discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using a dcf valuation analysis a marketbased valuation analysis or both 

  

2010 impairment testing 

the majority of our goodwill balance is the result of the discovery formation on september 17 2008 and a transaction with cox communications holdings inc in 2007 the “cox transaction” as a result of the discovery formation we allocated 18 billion of goodwill previously allocated to dhc’s equity investment in dch and 251 million of goodwill for the basis differential between the carrying value of dhc’s investment in dch to our reporting units the formation of dch as part of the cox transaction required “pushdown” accounting of each shareholder’s basis in dch the result was the pushdown of 46 billion of additional goodwill previously recorded on the investors’ books to dch reporting units 

we performed our 2010 annual goodwill impairment testing as of november 30 2010 we utilized a dcf model and market approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the dcf model utilizes projected financial results for each reporting unit the projected financial results are created from critical assumptions and estimates which are based on management’s business plans and historical trends the market approach relies on data from publicly traded guideline companies for the annual goodwill impairment test performed on november 30 2010 we did not significantly change the methodology from the prior year to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

impairment  during the quarter ended september 30 2010 we impaired all css goodwill of 11 million as of november 30 2010 the fair value of all our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values we did not perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 

sensitivity analysis  to illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment relative to future changes in estimated fair values there were no reporting units for which a 20 decline in fair value would result in the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeding its fair value given the reductions required and the assumptions used in our fair value modeling at the time of our impairment review there did not appear to be any likely changes or trigger events that would indicate an impairment of our reporting units 

2011 impairment testing 

in addition to our annual impairment review of goodwill we will be required to perform an interim impairment review at our us networks segment during the first quarter of 2011 as a result of contributing the discovery health network to own on january 1 2011 as the discovery health network was determined to be a business we will be required to allocate goodwill to the network based on its fair value relative to the fair value of the remaining portion of the us networks segment as of the time of filing this annual report on form 10k the amount of goodwill allocated to the discovery health network is not determinable as the fair value estimate of the contributed assets has not been completed 

longlived assets 

longlived assets such as amortizing trademarks customer lists other intangible assets and property and equipment are not required to be tested for impairment annually instead longlived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable such events include but are not limited to the likely disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets if an impairment analysis is required the impairment test employed is based on whether our intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale if the intent is to hold the asset for continued use the impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows the asset would not be deemed to be recoverable impairment would then be measured as the excess of fair value over the asset’s carrying value fair value is typically determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset if the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met the impairment test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its fair value less costs to sell to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference significant judgments in this area involve determining whether events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value 

there were no impairments of longlived assets during 2010 

income taxes 

income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes deferred taxes are measured using rates we expect to apply to taxable income in years in 

  

which those temporary differences are expected to reverse a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized 

we report a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return our policy is to classify tax interest and penalties related to tax reserves and unrecognized tax benefits as tax expense the liability for these items is included in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as appropriate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our financial position earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks we may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments unless there is an underlying exposure therefore we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

interest rates 

we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding 35 billion under various public senior notes with fixed interest rates additionally we have access to a 10 billion revolving credit facility with no amounts outstanding as of december 31 2010 if we were to draw on the revolving credit facility interest would have been variable based on an underlying index rate the nature and amount of our longterm debt may vary as a result of future requirements market conditions and other factors 

fixed and variable rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the interest rate or yield of fixed rate debt will impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the interest rate of variable debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our outstanding indebtedness for fixed rate debt we may enter into variable interest rate swaps effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid for variable rate debt we may enter into fixed interest rate swaps to effectively fix the amount of interest paid in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings there were no material interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2010 

as of december 31 2010 the fair value of our outstanding public senior notes was 37 billion the potential change in fair value of these senior notes from an adverse 100 basispoint change in quoted interest rates across all maturities often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve would be approximately 323 million as of december 31 2010 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates through december 31 2010 our international networks segment reported into the following four regions uk emea asiapacific and latin america cash is managed centrally within our four international regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements draw downs in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings since earnings of our international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely we do not hedge our investment in the net assets of those foreign operations 

the functional currency of substantially all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting as a result fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the british pound and the euro 

  

we may enter into spot forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures to foreign currency exchange risks associated with the cost for producing or acquiring programming abroad these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows we did not hold any foreign currency derivative instruments at december 31 2010 

market values of investments 

we had investments in entities accounted for using the equity method and highly liquid instruments such as certificates of deposit “cds” mutual funds and us treasury securities that are accounted for at fair value the carrying values of investments in equity method investees were 455 million and the carrying values of investments in cds mutual funds and us treasury securities totaled 430 million at december 31 2010 investments in cds mutual funds and us treasury securities include both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our income from such investments may decrease in the future a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in interest rates would not materially impact the fair values of our investments in cds mutual funds and us treasury securities as of december 31 2010

content development 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our distributors and advertising customers our production agreements fall into three categories commissions coproductions and acquisitions commissions refer to programming for which we generally own most or all rights for at least 10 years and in exchange for paying all production costs retain all editorial control coproductions refer to programs where we retain significant but more limited rights to exploit the programs the rights retained by us are generally in proportion to the total project costs we pay or incur which generally ranges from 35 to 75 of the total project cost coproductions are typically highcost projects for which neither we nor our coproducers wish to bear the entire cost or productions in which the producer has already taken on an international broadcast partner acquisitions are license agreements for films or series that have already been produced 

as network distribution and revenues have grown our program mix has matured from acquired content to sharing in coproductions to full commissions to minimize programming expense in the early stages as an audience base begins to form we use acquired programming to a greater extent and repeat it frequently the transition from acquired content provides for more customized use of programming for individual networks and broader rights for reuse on television networks and new platforms 

we source content from a wide range of producers building longstanding relationships with some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as consistently developing and encouraging young independent producers 

the programming schedule on our most widely distributed networks is mostly a mix of highcost “special event” programming combined with miniseries and regular series largescale programming events such as planet earth  when we left earth the nasa missions  nefertiti resurrected and walking with cavemen bring brand prestige favorable media coverage and substantial crosspromotional opportunities for other content platforms given the success of these global programming “tentpoles” we will continue to invest in a mix of programs that have the potential to draw larger audiences while also increasing the investment in regularly scheduled series 

we have an extensive library of programming and footage that provides a highquality source of programming for debuting new services quickly without significant incremental spending programming can be reedited and updated to provide topical versions of subject matter in a costeffective manner library development also provides a mechanism to share content around the world and repurpose for display on new digital and mobile platforms

distribution revenues represented 49 of our consolidated total revenues in 2009 distribution revenue in the us represented 46 of us networks revenue and international distribution fees represented 61 of international networks revenue in 2009 distribution revenue is generated through affiliation agreements with cable operators dth satellite operators and other television distributors which typically have a term of three to seven years these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and package inclusion whether on more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages and for payment of a fee to us based on the numbers of subscribers that receive our networks upon the launch of a new channel we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel such payments are referred to as “launch incentives” or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time we have longterm contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite operators around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors in the us over 90 of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times in 2010 through 2017 outside of the us less than 50 of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors 

advertising revenue 

advertising revenues comprised 41 of our consolidated total revenues in 2009 advertising revenue in the us represented 51 of us networks revenue and international advertising revenue represented 29 of international networks revenue in 2009 we typically build network brands by securing as broad a subscriber base as possible after obtaining sufficient distribution to provide an attractive platform for advertising we increase our investment in programming and marketing to build audience share and drive strong ratings performance in order to increase advertising sales opportunities advertising revenue depends on the number of subscribers receiving the service viewership demographics the ability to sell commercial time over a group of networks the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies such as the nielsen company revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality marketbased variations and general economic conditions advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters revenue can also fluctuate due to the popularity of particular programs and viewership ratings in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that may require us to provide additional advertising time or refunds if the guarantees are not met 

we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions 

our two largest networks discovery channel and tlc target key demographics that historically have been considered attractive to advertisers notably viewers in the 1854 age range who are viewed as having significant spending power discovery channel’s target audience skews toward male viewers while tlc targets female viewers providing a demographic balance in our portfolio for distribution and advertising clients 

we benefit by having a portfolio of networks appealing to a broad range of demographics this allows us to create advertising packages that exploit the strength of our large networks to benefit smaller niche or targeted networks and networks on digital tiers utilizing the strength of our diverse networks coupled with our online and digital platforms we seek to create innovative programming initiatives and multifaceted campaigns for the benefit of a wide variety of companies and organizations who desire to reach key audience demographics unique to each network we deliver customized integrated marketing campaigns to clients worldwide by catering to the special needs of multiregional advertisers who are looking for integrated campaigns that move beyond traditional spot advertising to include sponsorships product placements and other opportunities 

we also generate advertising revenue from our websites we sell advertising on our websites both on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

commerce education and other revenue 

commerce education and other revenues are principally generated from subscriptions to our educational streaming services royalty payments on the sale of products online and through catalogs and other revenue including media sound services and representation services 

subscription sales to our educational streaming services are primarily sold at the beginning of each school year as school budgets are appropriated and approved the revenue derived from the subscription agreements is generally recognized ratably over the school year sponsored strategic partnership programs are recognized as the campaigns are delivered education also provides products that are sold throughout the school year 

in april 2009 we completed the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model by outsourcing the commerce directtoconsumer operations including our commerce website related marketing product development and fulfillment to a third party as a 

  

result we now receive royalties on merchandise and wholesale payments for dvds sold based upon a percentage of our licensees’ wholesale revenues with an advance against future expected royalties as part of our commerce business we also have a domestic consumer products licensing business which licenses our brands in connection with merchandise dvds sponsored strategic partnerships videogames and publishing ecommerce and catalog sales are highly seasonal with a majority of the sales occurring in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season licensing revenue may vary from period to period depending upon the popularity of the properties available for license and the popularity of licensed products in a particular period 

we have agreements to represent third parties for us affiliate and advertising representation services the fees for these services are recorded as the services are provided 

operating expenditures 

our principal operating costs consist of programming expense personnel costs sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses content expense is our largest expense category representing 28 of our 2009 consolidated operating expenses as investment in maintaining highquality editorial and production values is a key differentiator for our content in connection with creating original content we incur production costs associated with acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative talent including actors writers and producers we incur sales and marketing expense to promote brand recognition and to secure quality distribution channels worldwide 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of local countries and international bodies such as the european union programming networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the federal communications commission “fcc” in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators affect programming networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

program access 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest under fcc rules such as those owned by us from entering into exclusive contracts for programming with a cable operator and from discriminating among competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” in the price terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of programming these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against program suppliers if an mvpd claims it is unable to obtain rights to programming on nondiscriminatory terms 

effect of “mustcarry” requirements 

the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 imposed “mustcarry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations direct broadcast satellite “dbs” systems are also subject to their own mustcarry rules fcc rules require cable systems to carry the digital signals of local television stations that have mustcarry status and to carry the same signal in analog format unless all subscribers have the necessary equipment to view the digital broadcast signal the fcc’s implementation of these “mustcarry” obligations requires cable and dbs operators to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and dbs operators 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions on children’s programming 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of programming for the hearing impaired and our programming and internet websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising 

regulation of the internet 

we operate several internet websites which we use to distribute information about and supplement our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the us relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal child online protection act copa and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited 

  

pornography and marketing act canspam in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the us the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

competition 

cable and satellite network programming is a highly competitive business in the us and worldwide our cable and satellite networks and websites generally compete for advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television networks online and mobile outlets radio programming and print media our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided to viewers including broadcast networks local overtheair television stations competitors’ pay and basic cable television networks payperview and videoondemand services online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment our networks also compete with other television networks for distribution and affiliate fees derived from distribution agreements with cable television operators satellite operators and other distributors our commerce and education divisions also operate in highly competitive industries with our ecommerce and catalogue business competing with brick and mortar and online retailers and our education business competing with other providers of educational products to schools including providers with longstanding relationships such as scholastic 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 4400 employees including fulltime and parttime employees of our whollyowned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures approximately 3200 of our employees were employed in the united states with the remaining 1200 employed outside the united states over 250 of css’ creative and technical personnel are subject to one of css’ collective bargaining agreements with the international alliance of theatrical stage employees there are no active grievances strikes or work stoppages and we believe our relations with our union and nonunion employees are strong 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming websites and other content trademarks in brands names and logos domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content are of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not always prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of our intellectual property we seek to limit that threat through a combination of approaches 

  

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy which encompasses both the theft of our signal and unauthorized use of our programming including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property

 item 1a risk factors tableend investing in our securities involves risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

our business would be adversely affected if general economic conditions further weaken 

the current economic downturn in the us and in other regions of the world in which we operate could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenue and earnings we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on our networks expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns the current economic conditions and any continuation of these adverse conditions may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities a decrease in advertising expenditures would have an adverse effect on our business the decline in economic conditions has impacted consumer discretionary spending a continued reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television subscriptions particularly to the more expensive digital service tiers which could lead to a decrease in our distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for advertising 

our success is dependent upon us and foreign audience acceptance of our programming and other entertainment content which is difficult to predict 

the production and distribution of pay television programs and other entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content and programming that meet the changing preferences of viewers in general viewers in special interest groups viewers in specific demographic categories and viewers in various overseas marketplaces the commercial success of our programming and other content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing programs and other content available in the applicable marketplace at the same time other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy digital and ondemand distribution and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both i the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and ii the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect all of our revenue streams 

  

the loss of our affiliation agreements or renewals with less advantageous terms could cause our revenue to decline 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the numbers of subscribers that receive our networks these persubscriber payments represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies from market to market and from distributor to distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are as favorable to us as those in effect today a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers including us the two largest us cable television system operators provide service to approximately 39 of us households receiving television programming from a multichannel provider and the two largest satellite television operators provide service to an additional 32 of such households in the us over 90 of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times beginning in 2010 through 2017 a failure to secure a renewal or a renewal on less favorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected in addition many of the overseas markets in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our programming and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue 

we operate in increasingly competitive industries 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for distribution viewers and advertising we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals and online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers in addition there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the enormously broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our educational video business competes with other providers of educational products to schools our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access our niche viewerships with appealing categoryspecific programming adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations both domestic and foreign 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and other mvpds are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video programming business see discussion under “business — regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other programming services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees government laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a country by country basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

  

increased programming production and content costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

one of our most significant areas of expense is the production and licensing of content in connection with creating original content we incur production costs associated with among other things acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative talent including actors writers and producers we also incur higher production costs when filming in hd than standard definition the costs of producing programming have generally increased in recent years these costs may continue to increase in the future which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we recently entered into a nonbinding agreement to develop a dedicated 3d television network costs associated with 3d programming both in production and in distribution are expected to be significantly higher than those for both standard and hd television which may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 

disruption or failure of satellites and facilities and disputes over supplier contracts on which we depend to distribute our programming could adversely affect our business 

we depend on transponders on satellite systems to transmit our media networks to cable television operators and other distributors worldwide the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks we obtain satellite transponder capacity pursuant to longterm contracts and other arrangements with thirdparty vendors which expire at various times through 2022 even with backup and redundant systems transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters or other conditions that may impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption or failure occurs we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we must respond to and capitalize on rapid changes in new technologies and distribution platforms including their effect on consumer behavior in order to remain competitive and exploit new opportunities 

technology in the video telecommunications and data services industry is changing rapidly we must adapt to advances in technologies distribution outlets and content transfer and storage to ensure that our content remains desirable and widely available to our audiences while protecting our intellectual property interests we may not have the right and may not be able to secure the right to distribute some of our licensed content across these or any other new platforms and must adapt accordingly the ability to anticipate and take advantage of new and future sources of revenue from these technological developments will affect our ability to expand our business and increase revenue 

similarly we also must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by technological advances such as videoondemand and a desire for more usergenerated and interactive content devices that allow consumers to view our entertainment content from remote locations or on a timedelayed basis and technologies which enable users to fastforward or skip advertisements may cause changes in audience behavior that could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenue if we cannot ensure that our content is responsive to the viewing preferences of our target audiences and capitalize on technological advances there could be a negative effect on our business 

we continue to develop new products and services for evolving markets there can be no assurance of the success of these efforts due to a number of factors some of which are beyond our control 

there are substantial uncertainties associated with our efforts to develop new products and services for evolving markets and substantial investments may be required initial timetables for the introduction and development of new products and services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as the development of competitive alternatives rapid technological change regulatory changes and shifting market preferences may cause new markets to move in unanticipated directions 

risks associated with our international operations could harm our financial condition 

our networks are offered worldwide inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include among other things longer payment cycles foreign taxation and currency exchange risk as we continue to expand the provision of our products and services to overseas markets we cannot assure you whether these risks and uncertainties will harm our results of operations 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by export and import restrictions other trade barriers and acts of disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation nationalization war insurrection terrorism or general social or political unrest or other hostilities 

  

the loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain these individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our revenue could be adversely affected 

piracy of our entertainment content including digital piracy may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our business and profitability 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands dvds cable television and other programming digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content 

financial market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

the recent changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 34 billion of consolidated debt excluding capital leases our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness in addition we have the ability to draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which has the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

restrictive covenants in the loan agreements for our revolving credit facility and term loans and the note purchase agreements governing our private placement notes could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreements for our revolving credit facility and term loans and the note purchase agreements governing the terms of our private placement notes contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and note purchase agreements require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants 

we are a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions in our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject 

our directors overlap with those of liberty media corporation and certain related persons of advancenewhouse which may lead to conflicting interests 

our elevenperson board of directors includes three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media corporation “liberty” including john c malone the chairman of the board of liberty three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global inc “liberty global” also including mr malone who is chairman of the board of liberty global and three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron the chairman of advancenewhouse and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse both liberty and the parent company of advancenewhouse own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses liberty does not own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty representing approximately 35 of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 40 of the aggregate voting power of liberty global and owns shares representing approximately 23 of the aggregate voting power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 32 of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock awarded by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock those of our directors who are also directors of liberty or liberty global own liberty or liberty global stock and stock incentives and own our stock and stock incentives advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a convertible preferred stock and two of its directors are chairman robert j miron and its chief executive officer steven a miron the advancenewhouse series a convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 26 of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us liberty liberty global andor advancenewhouse for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or liberty liberty global andor advancenewhouse on the other hand look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at liberty liberty global or advancenewhouse have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies although the terms of any transactions or agreements will be established based upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case where the parties are at arms’ length 

  

we may compete with liberty for business opportunities 

liberty owns interests in various us and international programming companies that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign programming services that may compete with the programming services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international programming opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries or liberty and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and liberty have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including liberty for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us

business overview 

we are a leading global media and entertainment company that provides original and purchased programming across multiple distribution platforms in the us and over 170 other countries including over 100 television networks offering customized programming in 38 languages our strategy is to optimize the distribution ratings and profit potential of each of our branded channels additionally we own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties and other digital services and develop and sell consumer and educational products as well as media sound services in the us and internationally 

our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators directtohome “dth” satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers 

in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded channels we are focused on extending content distribution across new distribution platforms including brandaligned web properties mobile devices videoondemand and broadband channels which provide promotional platforms for our television programming and serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales we also operate websites including howstuffworkscom petfindercom and treehuggercom that provide supplemental news information and entertainment aligned with our television programming 

  

we were formed in connection with discovery holding company “dhc” and advancenewhouse programming partnership “advancenewhouse” combining their respective ownership interests in discovery communications holding llc “dch” and exchanging those interests with and into discovery which was consummated on september 17 2008 the “newhouse transaction” prior to the newhouse transaction dch was a standalone private company which was owned approximately 66 2  3  by dhc and 33 1  3  by advancenewhouse the newhouse transaction was completed as follows 

 

  

  

 as a result of the newhouse transaction dhc and dch became whollyowned subsidiaries of discovery with discovery becoming the successor reporting entity to dhc under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” pursuant to guidance from the financial accounting standards board “fasb” on issues relating to accounting for business combinations for accounting purposes the newhouse transaction was treated as a nonsubstantive merger and therefore the newhouse transaction was recorded at the investors’ historical bases refer to note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further description of the newhouse transaction 

we manage and report our operations in three segments us networks international networks and commerce education and other 

us networks 

us networks is our largest segment which owns and operates 11 cable and satellite channels primarily throughout the us including discovery channel tlc and animal planet as well as a portfolio of website properties and other digital services the segment’s channels are whollyowned except for discovery kids which is operated through a 5050 joint venture between us and hasbro inc currently we own and operate the discovery health channel however pursuant to our joint venture arrangement with harpo inc for the oprah winfrey network “own” we will contribute our interest in the discovery health channel to own which is expected to occur in 2011 

us networks derives revenues primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales which comprised 46 and 51 respectively of revenues for this segment for the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2009 discovery channel tlc and animal planet collectively generated 77 of us networks’ total revenues us networks earns distribution fees under multiyear affiliation agreements with cable operators dth satellite operators and other distributors of television programming distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving our programming upon the launch of a new channel we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel such payments are referred to as “launch incentives” or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time launch incentives are amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of revenues over the term of the affiliation agreement us networks generates advertising revenues by selling commercial time on our networks and websites the number of subscribers to our channels viewership demographics the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising revenue 

us networks’ largest single cost is the cost of programming including production costs for original programming us networks amortizes the cost of original or purchased programming based on the expected realization of revenue resulting in an accelerated amortization method for discovery channel tlc and animal planet content and straightline amortization method over a maximum of four years for the remaining networks 

  

international networks 

international networks manages a portfolio of channels led by the discovery channel and animal planet brands that are distributed in virtually every paytelevision market in the world through an infrastructure that includes major operational centers in london singapore and miami international networks’ regional operations cover most major markets and are organized into four locallymanaged regional operations the united kingdom “uk” europe excluding the uk middle east and africa “emea” asiapacific and latin america international networks currently operates over 100 unique distribution feeds in 38 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities most of the segment’s channels are whollyowned with the exception of the international animal planet channels which are generally joint ventures in which the british broadcasting corporation “bbc” owns 50 peoplearts which operates in latin america and iberia as a 5050 joint venture with the bbc and several channels in japan and canada which operate as joint ventures with strategically important local partners 

similar to our us networks segment the primary sources of revenues for international networks are distribution fees and advertising sales and the primary cost is programming international networks executes a localization strategy by offering shared programming with us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds for the year ended december 31 2009 distribution revenues represented approximately 61 of the segment’s operating revenues 

advertising sales are increasingly important to the segment’s financial success representing 29 of the segment’s total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are more advanced digital multichannel television markets while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital 

in developing pay television markets we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay television in relatively mature markets such as the uk the growth dynamic is changing increased market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets instead growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing pay television networks and launching new services either in pay television or free television environments 

commerce education and other 

our commerce business engages with licensees manufacturers publishers and retailers to design develop publish promote and sell a wide variety of products based on our intellectual property we primarily engage in catalog sales and online distribution of products through discoverystorecom in april 2009 we completed the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model by outsourcing the commerce directtoconsumer operations including our commerce website related marketing product development and fulfillment to a third party in exchange for royalties the new structure for our commerce business enables us to continue offering high quality dvd programming as well as many merchandise categories leveraging both licensed and make and sell products we expect a reduction in our year over year topline revenue contribution as well as a reduction in direct operating expenses through the first fiscal quarter of 2010 

our education business is focused on our domestic and international directtoschool k12 online streaming distribution subscription services as well as our professional development services for teachers benchmark student assessment services and publishing hardcopy content through a network of distribution channels including online catalog and dealers our education business also participates in a growing sponsorship global brand and content licensing business with leading nonprofits foundations trade associations and fortune 500 companies 

other businesses primarily include sound music mixing sound effects and other related services to major motion picture studios independent producers broadcast networks cable channels advertising agencies and interactive producers 

recent developments 

accounting for variable interest entities 

effective january 1 2010 we adopted the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” statement amending the accounting for interests in a variable interest entity “vie” pursuant to the adoption of this statement beginning january 1 2010 we will no longer consolidate the oprah winfrey network “own” and animal planet japan “apj” joint ventures and will account for our interest in these entities under the equity method of accounting however we continued to consolidate own and apj through december 31 2009 accordingly for the periods in which we were required to consolidate own and apj under the existing accounting standards the financial information in this annual report on form 10k includes the financial position and operating results of these entities beginning in 2010 we will apply the provisions of the new statement retrospectively to financial information for all periods presented 

  

in accordance with the existing accounting guidance that required us to consolidate own half of the operating losses generated during 2009 by own were allocated to harpo inc “harpo” our joint venture partner as a component of loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  in connection with the change in our method of accounting for our interest in own from consolidation to the equity method because of our obligation to fund own’s operations up to 100 million we will absorb all of the joint venture’s losses up to our funding commitment similarly upon adoption we will record 17 million of own’s 2009 operating losses that were previously allocated to harpo as a component of other nonoperating income expense net  

reportable segments 

effective january 1 2010 we realigned the discovery commerce business from the commerce education and other reporting segment into the us networks reporting segment in connection with this realignment we changed the name of our commerce education and other reporting segment to education and other the financial information in this annual report on form 10k has not been recast to reflect the realignment accordingly the results of operations for the discovery commerce business are included in the financial results for the commerce education and other segment beginning in 2010 we will include the discovery commerce business in the financial results for the us networks segment and will recast prior period results to conform to the new presentation 

hasbrodiscovery joint venture 

on may 22 2009 we formed a 5050 joint venture with hasbro inc “hasbro” that will operate a television network and website dedicated to highquality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming in connection with the arrangement discovery contributed the us discovery kids network “discovery kids” to the joint venture additionally hasbro acquired a 50 ownership interest in the joint venture for a cash payment of 300 million and a tax receivables agreement collectible over 20 years valued at 57 million which resulted in a total gain of 252 million the rebranded network is scheduled to premiere in late 2010 additional information regarding the joint venture is disclosed in note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

items impacting comparability 

beginning may 22 2009 we ceased to consolidate the operating results of discovery kids however as we continue to be involved in the operations of the joint venture we have not presented the financial position results of operations and cash flows of discovery kids recorded through may 21 2009 as discontinued operations our interest in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method of accounting accordingly our consolidated results of operations and our us networks segment include the operating results of discovery kids through may 21 2009 whereas for subsequent periods we record only our proportionate share of the joint venture’s net operating results the following table presents total revenues and operating expenses recognized by discovery for discovery kids prior to deconsolidation in millions 

 

 our results of operations were also impacted by the effects of consolidating own beginning in july 2008 and to a lesser extent the change in our commerce business model to a licensing model in april 2009 for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 own incurred operating expenses of 26 million and 6 million respectively 

  

results of operations — 2009 vs 2008 

the following table presents our consolidated results of operation for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 nm  not meaningful 

revenues 

distribution revenues increased 73 million for 2009 as compared to distribution revenues for 2008 due primarily to contractual rate increases subscriber growth and a reduction in amortization for launch incentives at our us networks segment and subscriber growth at our international networks segment these increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of discovery kids in may 2009 which resulted in a decline of 20 million and the absence of a onetime revenue correction recorded in 2008 that increased revenues 8 million distribution revenues were also adversely affected by unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of 37 million for the year ended december 31 2009 excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates the deconsolidation of discovery kids and the onetime revenue correction in 2008 distribution revenues increased 9 or 138 million 

advertising revenues for 2009 increased 32 million over advertising revenues for 2008 the increase in advertising revenues was principally due to higher ratings and overall price increases at our us networks segment and increased viewership and subscriber growth at our international networks segment advertising revenues in 2009 also benefited from a 6 million settlement of a prior contract dispute at our uk operations the increases were partially offset by unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of 26 million for the year ended december 31 2009 excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates and the contract dispute settlement advertising revenues grew 4 or 52 million 

other revenues which primarily consist of sales of educational services and content distribution and advertising sales services license fees dvds merchandise and sound and music services decreased 32 million for 2009 as compared with 2008 the decline 

  

is attributable to decreasing merchandise sales as a result of changing our business model from directtoconsumer to a licensing model where we receive royalties lower sales of hard copy educational content as purchasers migrate to online distribution a decline in sales of the planet earth dvd series and a 6 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates these decreases were partially offset by an increase in online streaming distribution revenues from our education business and 6 million recorded in 2009 in connection with renegotiating our agreements to provide programming to a joint venture we expect a reduction in our year over year commerce revenues and direct operating costs through the first fiscal quarter of 2010 due to the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist primarily of content amortization expense production costs distribution costs and sales commissions increased 41 million for 2009 when compared to costs of revenues for 2008 the increase was primarily due to higher content amortization expense and writeoffs primarily at our us networks and internal networks segments as well as higher distribution costs at our international networks segment total content amortization increased 53 million of which 17 million was attributable to a higher content asset balance while a 36 million was due to an increase in writeoffs was due to the decision not to proceed with certain programs or lower than expected revenues these increases were partially offset by the effect of deconsolidating discovery kids which resulted in a decline of 12 million a 6 million reduction in our music rights accrual at the international networks segment the reduction in costs of goods sold as a result of transitioning our commerce business to a license model and a 30 million favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates programming writeoffs the deconsolidation of discovery kids and the music rights accrual reduction costs of revenues increased 6 or 53 million 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which are principally comprised of employee costs marketing costs research costs and occupancy and back office support fees increased 132 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 due primarily to a 294 million increase in employee costs related to sharebased compensation programs and the impact of consolidating own beginning in july 2008 which increased costs by 19 million the increase was partially offset by lower marketing costs consulting fees nonsharebased employee costs all of which reflect targeted cost savings initiatives and improvements in operating efficiencies and a 5 million reduction due to the deconsolidation of discovery kids in may 2009 additionally selling general and administrative expenses were down as a result of favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates of 25 million 

employee costs include sharebased compensation expense arising from equity awards to employees under our incentive plans total sharebased compensation expense was 228 million for 2009 as compared to a net benefit of 66 million for 2008 the increase in sharebased compensation primarily reflects an increase in the fair value of outstanding cashsettled equity awards and to a lesser extent an increase in stock options outstanding a portion of our equity awards are cashsettled and therefore the value of such awards outstanding must be remeasured at fair value each reporting date based on changes in the price of our series a common stock compensation expense for cashsettled equity awards including changes in fair value was 205 million for 2009 as compared to a net benefit of 69 million for 2008 increased compensation expense for cashsettled awards was due to an increase in fair value which reflects the increase in the price of our series a common stock of 117 during the year ended december 31 2009 we do not intend to grant additional cashsettled equity awards except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries in which stock option awards are not permitted we are evaluating our equitybased compensation program and considering changing our current mix of awards to include performancebased restricted stock unit grants 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 31 million for 2009 as compared to the depreciation and amortization expense for 2008 the decrease was due to a decline in amortization expense resulting from lower intangible asset balances in 2009 compared to 2008 

restructuring and impairment charges 

restructuring and impairment charges increased 5 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 we recorded 32 million and 30 million of impairment charges related to intangible assets goodwill and capitalized software during 2009 and intangible assets in 2008 respectively primarily for certain asset groups at our other us networks reporting unit due to declines in expected operating performance 

we also recorded exit and restructuring charges of 34 million and 31 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively in connection with a reorganization of portions of our operations to reduce our cost structure the charges for 2009 were primarily incurred by our us networks and international networks segments as well as our corporate operations and include 29 million of severance costs and 5 million of contract termination costs we expect the majority of these charges to be paid within the next year we do not expect material future charges associated with these restructuring programs 

  

the charges incurred in 2008 were primarily related to tlc’s repositioning strategy the termination of a production group and the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to thirdparty service providers 

gain on disposition 

in connection with the formation of the hasbrodiscovery joint venture we recorded a 252 million gain during 2009 which included 127 million as a result of “stepping up” our basis for the 50 retained interest in discovery kids and 125 million for the sale of 50 of our ownership interest to hasbro 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 6 million for 2009 when compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in the average effective interest rate on our borrowings 

other nonoperating income expense net 

other nonoperating income expense net includes our realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative transactions that are not accounted for as hedging instruments realized gains and losses from sale of availableforsale securities gains and losses from equity method investments and other nonoperating expenses net of nonoperating income other nonoperating income expense net improved 93 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 the improvement was due to the absence of a 57 million charge recorded in 2008 for the otherthantemporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in hswi which was partially offset by the absence of a corresponding onetime adjustment of 47 million recorded in 2008 to reduce the liability related to the value of shares in hswi to be exchanged to its former shareholders additionally we recognized net realized and unrealized gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments of 20 million during 2009 as compared to net realized and unrealized losses of 31 million during 2008 due to increased market values the improvements were also driven by the sale of certain investments in 2009 that resulted in pretax gains of 15 million and a net increase of 12 million in income from investments accounted for using the equity method excluding the hswi impairment 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 472 million and 352 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively the effective tax rates were 46 and 47 for 2009 and 2008 the effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to a permanent difference on the 252 million gain from the sale of a 50 interest in and deconsolidation of discovery kids in may 2009 state income taxes and to a lesser extent deductions for domestic production activities 

the effective tax rate for 2008 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 principally due to the presentation of the newhouse transaction as though it was consummated on january 1 2008 accordingly our consolidated financial statements include the gross combined financial results of both dhc and dch since january 1 2008 prior to the newhouse transaction on september 17 2008 dhc owned 66 2  3   of dch and therefore recognized a portion of dch’s operating results as a result the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2008 includes the taxes recognized by both dch and dhc related to the portion of dch’s operating results recognized by dhc dhc recognized 91 million of deferred tax expense related to its investment in dch prior to the newhouse transaction for 2008 the provision for income taxes for 2008 was partially offset by the release of an 18 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of css and the release of a 10 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards for amc 

net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of net operating results allocable to the noncontrolling partners which was 1 million for 2009 and 128 million for 2008 the change in net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily a result of allocating a portion of dch’s 2008 profits to advancenewhouse for its ownership interest in dch prior to the newhouse transaction 

income from discontinued operations net of taxes 

in september 2008 as part of the newhouse transaction dhc completed the spinoff to its shareholders of amc which did not result in a gain or loss 

  

in september 2008 prior to the newhouse transaction dhc sold its ownership interests in ascent media systems  technology services llc “amsts” and ascent media cans llc dba “accenthealth” for approximately 7 million and 119 million respectively in cash the sale of these companies resulted in pretax gains of 3 million for amsts and 64 million for accenthealth 

also in september 2008 prior to the newhouse transaction dhc disposed of certain buildings and equipment for approximately 13 million in cash dhc recognized a pretax gain of approximately 9 million in connection with the asset disposals the disposed assets were part of the amc business 

the following table presents summary financial information for discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2008 in millions 

 

 stock dividends to preferred interests 

during 2009 the company recognized 8 million for noncash stock dividends for the release of approximately 500000 shares of preferred stock from escrow additional information regarding the stock dividend is set forth in note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

segment results of operations 

as noted above we manage and report our operations in three segments us networks international networks and commerce education and other corporate primarily consists of corporate functions executive management administrative support services and ancillary revenues and expenses from a consolidated joint venture corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon decisions made directly by segment executives operating results exclude marktomarket sharebased compensation restructuring and impairment charges and gains losses on business and asset dispositions consistent with our segment reporting additional financial information related to our segments is set forth in note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization “adjusted oibda” adjusted oibda is defined as revenues less costs of revenues and selling general and administrative expenses excluding i marktomarket sharebased compensation ii depreciation and amortization iii amortization of deferred launch incentives iv exit and restructuring charges v impairment charges and vi gains losses on business and asset dispositions we use this measure to assess operating results and performance of our segments perform analytical comparisons identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses and also provides investors a measure to analyze the operating performance of each segment against historical data we exclude marktomarket sharebased compensation exit and restructuring charges impairment charges and gains losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their volatility or nonrecurring nature we also exclude the amortization of deferred launch incentive payments because these payments are infrequent and the amortization does not represent cash payments in the current reporting period because adjusted oibda is a nongaap measure it should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for operating income net income cash flows provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us gaap

 revenues 

total revenues for 2009 increased 80 million as compared to total revenues for 2008 the increase in total revenues was due primarily to increases in distribution revenues of 55 million and advertising revenues of 24 million 

increased distribution revenues for 2009 were due to annual contractual rate increases an increase in paying subscribers principally for networks carried on the digital tier and a decline of 13 million for the amortization of launch incentives these increases were partially offset by the effect of deconsolidating discovery kids in may 2009 which resulted in a decline of 20 million and the absence of a onetime revenue correction recorded during the second quarter of 2008 that increased revenues 8 million 

advertising revenues for 2009 increased as a result of higher ratings and overall increased pricing which were partially offset by lower cash sellouts due to softness in the economy 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which consist primarily of content amortization expense sales commissions production costs and distribution costs increased 24 million for 2009 as compared to costs of revenues for 2008 the increase in costs of revenues was driven by an increase of 30 million in content amortization expense of which 18 million was due to a higher content asset balance reflecting our continued investment in content and 12 million was attributable to higher writeoffs of certain programming costs that are included as content amortization partially offset by decreases in production and distribution costs the increase in costs of revenues is net of a 12 million decline due to the effect of deconsolidating discovery kids

revenues 

our consolidated revenues increased 240 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 as adjusted distribution revenues increased 163 million during the year primarily due to international networks subscriber growth combined with annual contract increases for the fully distributed us networks offset by the disposition of travel channel advertising revenues increased 51 million for the period and is primarily attributed to higher pricing and cash sellout rates in us networks other revenues increased 26 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 as adjusted primarily due to an increase in licensing revenues in the international networks increase in sales of the planet earth dvd through a joint venture and increases in revenues from our representation of the travel channel through our us networks segment offset by a decline in revenues from the direct to consumer business in our commerce education and other business segment 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues which includes content amortization and other production related expenses in addition to distribution and merchandising costs decreased 203 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared to 2007 as adjusted the decrease in costs of revenues was primarily due to the effect of content impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2007 of 139 million primarily in us networks coupled with a 76 million decrease in related amortization expense these decreases were partially offset by increases in costs of revenue in the international networks and content impairment related to tlc 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses which include certain personnel marketing and other general and administrative expenses decreased 203 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 2007 as adjusted primarily attributable to a 210 million decrease in expenses arising from longterm incentive plans which were partially offset by slight increases in costs incurred in conjunction with dch preparing to become a consolidated subsidiary of ours as a result of the newhouse transaction and an increase in personnel costs in international networks expenses arising from longterm incentive plans are largely related to dch’s unitbased longterm incentive plan the discovery appreciation plan or the “dap” or “ltip” which was modified to reflect our capital structure following the newhouse transaction prior to the newhouse transaction the value of units in the ltip was indexed to the value of dhc series a common stock after the newhouse transaction the units remained outstanding and were converted at the effective time of the newhouse transaction to track changes in the value of our series a common stock the change in unit value of ltip awards outstanding is recorded as expenses arising from longterm incentive plans over the period outstanding primarily due to the decrease in both the dhc series a common stock and our series a common stock price during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a benefit of 69 million to expenses arising from longterm incentive plans in 2008 compared to expenses arising from longterm incentive plans of 141 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as adjusted in the fourth quarter 2008 eligible new hires and promoted employees received stock options that vest in four equal installments and those employees with ltip units that vest between september 18 2008 and march 14 2009 will receive cashsettled stock appreciation awards that expire in march 2010 we do not intend to make additional cashsettled stock appreciation awards except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries where stock option awards are not permitted 

depreciation and amortization 

the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2008 is due to an increase in intangible assets resulting from the reclassification of dhc intangibles following the newhouse transaction and the howstuffworkscom acquisition 

restructuring and impairment charges 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 31 million in restructuring charges of which 11 million relates to the relocation and severance costs related to tlc’s repositioning strategy 6 million for the termination of a production group and 6 million due to the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to thirdparty service providers during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded restructuring charges of 20 million related to a number of organizational and strategic adjustments the purpose of these adjustments was to better align our organizational structure with our new strategic priorities and to respond to continuing changes within the media industry 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a writeoff of intangible assets of 30 million related to our howstuffworkscom business this writeoff of intangible assets was due to the decline in the cash flows projected to be generated by the howstuffworkscom business during the second quarter of 2007 dch recorded an asset impairment of 26 million which represents writeoffs of intangible assets related to the education business 

  

gains on dispositions 

in 2007 we exchanged the capital stock of a subsidiary that held the travel channel and travelchannelcom collectively the “travel business” for cox communications holdings inc’s 25 ownership interest in us and 13 billion in cash the distribution of the travel business which was valued at 575 million resulted in a 135 million taxfree gain 

interest expense net 

on may 14 2007 we entered into a 15 billion term loan in conjunction with the transaction with cox communications holdings inc offset by a 180 million payment for a senior note that matured the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 as adjusted is primarily a result of the term loan 

other nonoperating expense income net 

other nonoperating expense income net includes our equity in the operating results of unconsolidated affiliates other nonoperating income net of nonoperating expenses as well as unrealized losses from derivative instruments equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 consisted primarily of a 57 million otherthantemporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in hswi coupled with 13 million in equity losses recorded during 2008 which is offset by equity in income from our joint ventures in canada and japan in 2007 we recognized 9 million of equity in income primarily from our joint ventures in canada and japan 

other nonoperating income consisted of a 47 million reduction of a liability related to the value of shares in hswi to be exchanged to its former shareholders which was recorded in december 2008 offsetting this nonoperating income is unrealized losses from derivative transactions unrealized losses from derivative transactions relate primarily to our use of derivative instruments to modify our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt these instruments include a combination of swaps caps collars and other structured instruments as a result of unrealized mark to market adjustments we recognized unrealized losses of 31 million and 9 million during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the foreign exchange hedging instruments used by us are spot forward and option contracts additionally we enter into nondesignated forward contracts to hedge nondollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 47 and 36 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 as adjusted respectively our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 differed from the federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to dhc’s recognition of deferred tax expense related to its investment in dch net of tax benefit from intangible amortization related to the spinoff of the travel channel in 2007 which is partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of ascent media sound inc other items impacting the effective tax rate include the following our conversion from deducting foreign taxes to claiming foreign tax credits foreign unrecognized tax positions and other miscellaneous items our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 as adjusted was not materially different than the federal income tax rate of 35 however during this period we benefited from the taxfree treatment of the gain recognized on the disposition of the travel channel and the release of travel channel deferred tax liabilities offset by the tax impact of discontinued operations 

income loss from discontinued operations net of taxes 

summarized financial information included in discontinued operations is set forth in the following table in millions 

 

   

on september 17 2008 as part of the newhouse transaction dhc completed the spinoff to its shareholders of amc a subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of dhc except for css which provides sound music mixing sound effects and other related services under brand names such as sound one pop sound soundelux and todd ao which businesses remained with us following the completion of the newhouse transaction the amc spinoff was structured such that there was no gain or loss related to the transaction 

just prior to the newhouse transaction dhc sold its ownership interests in ascent media cans llc dba accenthealth to accenthealth holdings llc an unaffiliated third party for approximately 119 million in cash it was determined that accenthealth was a noncore asset and the sale of accenthealth was consistent with dhc’s strategy to divest noncore assets dhc recognized a pretax gain of approximately 64 million in connection with the sale of accenthealth which is recorded as a component of discontinued operations as there is no continuing involvement in the operations of amc or accenthealth the financial results of their operations have been presented as discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

following a comprehensive strategic review of our businesses we closed 103 mallbased and standalone discovery stores in the third quarter of 2007 as there is no continuing involvement in the retail stores or significant migration of retail customers to ecommerce the results of the retail business are accounted for as discontinued operations in the asadjusted results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 

net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests primarily represent our and consolidated entities’ portion of earnings which are allocable to the noncontrolling partners the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended december 31 2008 is primarily a result of our increased profits allocated to noncontrolling partners prior to the newhouse transaction and reporting of our financial results in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations “asc 810”

advertising revenue increased 83 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with the prior year primarily due to higher pricing in the upfront and scatter markets as well as higher cash sellouts which were partially offset by underdelivery of committed audience levels when compared with the corresponding prior year periods 

other revenue increased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily from our representation of the travel channel which increased 11 million during the period coupled with an increase of 5 million in revenue from how stuff works which was acquired in december 2007 these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 6 million of international program sales revenue which is now reported in the international networks segment 

costs of revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2008 costs of revenues decreased 164 million when compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in content amortization expense of 156 million the decrease in content amortization expense was primarily a result of the effect of the 129 million content impairment charge recorded in 2007 following a change in management and related changes in strategy this charge coupled with the related 76 million decrease in content amortization expense was offset by 17 million of content impairment charges for tlc programs following a change in management and related changes in strategy in the second half of 2008 and content amortization expense for new programming on discovery channel tlc planet green and science channel 

selling general and administrative 

total selling general and administrative expenses increased 29 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 which was primarily a result of a 34 million increase in personnel costs primarily driven by continued investment in digital media including acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 this increase was partially offset by decreased marketing expense of 12 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with the corresponding prior year period 

  

adjusted oibda 

the us networks segment’s operating performance improved as reflected by an increase in adjusted oibda of 301 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 the improved performance is primarily due to revenue growth driven by subscriber growth coupled with higher pricing and lower costs of revenue due to declines in content amortization expense

advertising revenue increased 6 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 advertising revenue increased 42 million in emea and latin america primarily due to higher viewership combined with an increased subscriber base in most markets worldwide these increases were offset by a 35 million decrease in the uk due to an interpretation of a contract provision resulting in a limitation in our ability to monetize our audience in the uk as well as a deterioration in market conditions advertising revenue decreased 4 million due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange 

other revenue increased 24 million mainly due to improvement in licensing and sales of programs primarily in the uk offset by a 2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact

revenues 

commerce education and other total revenues decreased 29 million for the year ended 2008 when compared with the prior year a challenging retail environment in 2008 coupled with the success of the planet earth dvd in 2007 contributed to a year over year decline of 48 in revenue from the direct to consumer business which was partially offset by higher licensing revenue education revenue increased by 6 million as the core streaming business continued to grow new revenue streams in licensing and sponsorships were slightly offset by the decline in the hardcopy business as customers shifted to our digital services revenues generated by the css business were relatively flat compared with 2007 

costs of revenues 

costs of revenues decreased 35 million for the year ended december 31 2008 commensurate with the decrease in commerce’s product revenue coupled with a decrease in education’s content amortization which resulted from the fourth quarter 2007 writeoff of capitalized content costs that were not aligned with education’s product offerings

we and the bbc have formed several cable and satellite television network joint ventures to develop and distribute programming content under the terms of our agreements with the bbc it has the right every three years starting december 31 2002 to require us to purchase its ownership interests in those joint ventures due to the complexities of the redemption formula we have accrued the value of the redemption or put right at approximately 49 million as of december 31 2009 we are currently discussing with the bbc potential revisions to all of our contractual relationships including the ownership of the joint ventures while there can be no assurance that these or other negotiations would result in a definitive agreement we expect that the cost of a negotiated acquisition of the bbc’s interests in the joint ventures could substantially exceed the value of the put right 

on july 23 2008 we formed a 5050 joint venture with oprah winfrey and harpo inc pursuant to the venture agreement discovery is committed to loan up to 100 million to the venture through september 30 2011 to fund operations of which 35 million has been funded as of december 31 2009 we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet funding needs under our obligation in 2010 to the extent that funding the joint venture in excess of 100 million is necessary we may provide additional funds through a member loan or require the joint venture to seek third party financing we expect to recoup the entire amount contributed in future periods provided that the joint venture is profitable and has sufficient funds to repay us we are currently discussing with harpo a number of matters regarding the own network including digital strategy the programming and development pipeline and increases in our funding commitment which is currently 100 million 

financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2009 356 million of cash was used in financing activities as compared to 774 million used for the year ended december 31 2008 and 187 million provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2007 our primary use of cash for financing activities during 2009 was principal payments under our debt facilities totaling 13 billion this outflow was partially offset by 970 million in net cash proceeds from term loan c and the august 2019 notes discussed previously during the year ended december 31 2008 our primary uses of cash for financing activities were 356 million in cash disbursed in connection with the spinoff of ascent media corporation and principal repayments of 382 million under our debt facilities 

in 2010 we expect our uses of cash to include a minimum of 20 million for debt repayments between 210 million and 240 million for interest expense and approximately 50 million for capital expenditures additionally we expect to make payments to settle vested employee cashsettled equity awards actual amounts expensed and payable for cashsettled equity awards are dependent on future calculations of fair value which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price changes in the number of awards outstanding and changes to the plan the current portion accrued for these cashsettled awards was 117 million as of december 31 2009 

factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

if we were to experience a significant decline in operating performance or have to meet an unanticipated need for additional liquidity beyond our available commitments there is no certainty that we would be able to access the needed liquidity while we have established relationships with us and international banks and investors which continue to participate in our various credit agreements the current state of the credit markets may cause some lenders to have to reduce or withdraw their commitments if we were to seek to negotiate a refinancing or an increase in our total commitments covenants in existing debt agreements may constrain our capacity for additional debt or there may be significant increases in costs to refinance existing debt to access additional liquidity as a public company we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets however access to sufficient liquidity in these markets is not assured given our substantial debt outstanding and the continued volatility in the equity and credit markets 

on june 17 2009 we filed a registration statement on form s3 “shelf registration” with the sec in which we registered securities including debt securities common stock and preferred stock the august 2019 notes were issued under this shelf registration while we are not required to issue additional securities under this shelf registration we may issue additional securities at a future date 

our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside of our control in addition our cost to borrow is impacted by market conditions and our financial performance as measured by certain credit metrics defined in our credit agreements including interest coverage and leverage ratios 

  

we expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations in 2010 combined with 623 million of cash on hand at december 31 2009 to meet future needs including mandatory principal repayments of debt interest payments expected capital expenditures and payments to settle vested employee cashsettled equity awards in addition we have 16 billion of available capacity on our existing revolving credit facility if our cash flow from operations is less than anticipated our revolving credit facility expires in october 2010 we are currently assessing our options to extend or enter into a new facility 

we were compliant with all debt covenants as of december 31 2009 and have sufficient excess capacity to draw on existing debt commitments or incur additional debt we have no indication that any of our lenders would be unable to perform under the requirements of our credit agreements should we seek additional funding although our leverage and interest coverage covenants limit the total amount of debt we might incur relative to our operating cash flow we expect we would continue to maintain compliance with our debt covenants with a 50 reduction in our current operating performance 

contractual obligations 

we have agreements for leases of satellite transponders facilities and equipment these agreements expire at various dates through 2028 we are obligated to license programming under agreements with content suppliers that expire over various dates we also have other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business 

a summary of all of the expected payments for these commitments as well as future principal payments under the current debt arrangements and minimum payments under capital leases at december 31 2009 is as follows in millions 

 

  

     

we are subject to a contractual agreement that may require us to acquire the noncontrolling interest of certain of our subsidiaries the amount and timing of such payments are not currently known and accordingly are not included in the table above we have recorded a 49 million liability as of december 31 2009 for this redemption right refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of regulation sk that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances the results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions critical accounting policies impact the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates an appreciation of our critical accounting policies facilitates an understanding of our financial results unless otherwise noted we applied our critical accounting policies and estimates methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented for further information regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

for financial reporting purposes we are the successor reporting entity to dhc because there is no effective change in ownership in accordance with asc 810 both dhc and dch have been consolidated in our financial statements as if the transaction had occurred january 1 2008 our critical accounting policies were adopted from dch following the newhouse transaction for purposes of analyzing our critical accounting policies we present associated 2008 financial information consistent with our financial statement presentation and present associated 2007 financial information consistent with the financial statement presentation of dch 

revenues 

we derive revenues from i distribution revenues from cable systems satellite operators and other distributors ii advertising aired on our networks and websites and iii other which is largely educational sales ecommerce sales and postproduction sound and service sales 

distribution 

distributors generally pay a persubscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming under the terms of longterm distribution contracts “distribution revenues” distribution revenues are reported net of incentive costs or other consideration if any offered to system operators in exchange for longterm distribution contracts we recognize distribution revenues over the term of the contracts based on contracted monthly license fee provisions and reported subscriber levels network incentives have historically included upfront cash incentives referred to as “launch incentive” in connection with the launch of a network by the distributor within certain time frames any such amounts are capitalized as assets upon launch of our programming by the distributor and are amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of revenue over the terms of the contracts in instances where the distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of the original term we evaluate the economics of the extended term and if it is determined that the deferred launch asset continues to benefit us over the extended term then we will adjust the launch amortization period accordingly other incentives are recognized as a reduction of revenue as incurred 

the amount of distribution revenues due to us is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period therefore reported distribution revenues are based upon our estimates of the number of subscribers receiving our programming for the month plus an adjustment for the prior month estimate our subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor 

advertising 

we record advertising revenues net of agency commissions and audience deficiency liabilities in the period advertising spots are broadcast a substantial portion of the advertising sold in the united states includes guaranteed levels of audience that either the program or the advertisement will reach deferred revenue is recorded and adjusted as the guaranteed audience levels are achieved 

  

audience guarantees are initially developed by our internal research group and actual audience and delivery information is provided by third party ratings services in certain instances the third party ratings information is not received until after the close of the reporting period in these cases reported advertising revenues and related deferred revenue are based on our estimates for any underdelivery of contracted advertising ratings based on the most current data available from the third party ratings service differences between the estimated underdelivery and the actual underdelivery have historically been insignificant online advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered 

certain of our advertising arrangements include deliverables in addition to commercial time such as the advertiser’s product integration into the programming customized vignettes and billboards these contracts that include other deliverables are evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under fasb asc topic 605 revenue recognition “asc 605” 

other 

other revenues primarily consist of revenues from our education css advertising representation and commerce businesses educational service sales are generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement css services revenues are recognized when services are performed revenues from postproduction advertising representation and certain distribution related services are recognized when services are provided prepayments received for services to be performed at a later date are deferred commerce revenues are recognized upon product shipment net of estimated returns which are not material to our consolidated financial statements 

content rights 

costs incurred in the direct production coproduction or licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost fair value or net realizable value in accordance with fasb’s position on accounting by producers or distributors of films fasb asc topic 926 entertainment films “asc 926” we amortize our content assets based upon the ratio of current revenue to total estimated revenue “ultimate revenue” to determine this ratio we analyze historical and projected usage for similar programming and apply such usage factors to projected revenues by network adjusted for any future significant programming strategy changes 

the result of this policy is an accelerated amortization pattern for the fully distributed us networks segment discovery channel tlc animal planet and discovery channel in the international networks segment over a period of no more than four years the accelerated amortization pattern results in the amortization of approximately 40 to 50 of the program cost during the first year topical or current events programming is amortized over shorter periods based on the nature of the programming and may be expensed upon its initial airing all other networks in the us networks segment and international networks segment utilize up to a five year useful life for these networks with programming investment levels lower than the established networks and higher reuse of programming straightline amortization is considered a reasonable estimate of the use of content consistent with the pace of earning ultimate revenue 

ultimate revenue assessments include advertising and affiliate revenue streams ancillary revenue is considered immaterial to the assessment changes in management’s assumptions such as changes in expected use could significantly alter our estimates for amortization 

on a periodic basis management evaluates the net realizable value of content in conjunction with our strategic review of the business if we expect to alter the planned use of programming because of a change in network strategy the unamortized balance is adjusted to net realizable value when we identify the need to alter the planned use changes in management’s assumptions such as changes in expected use could significantly alter our estimates for writeoffs 

sharebased compensation 

we have incentive plans under which cashsettled unit awards stock appreciation rights “sars” stock options and restricted stock units “rsus” were issued 

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for cashsettled unit awards and sars based on the fair value of the award less estimated forfeitures because unit awards and sars are cashsettled we remeasure the fair value of outstanding unit awards and sars each reporting period until settlement compensation expense including changes in fair value for unit awards and sars is recognized during the vesting period in proportion to the requisite service that has been rendered at the reporting date for grants of unit awards with graded vesting we measure fair value and record compensation expense for the grant as a single award for grants of sars with graded vesting we measure fair value and record compensation expense separately for each tranche changes in the fair value of outstanding unit awards and sars that occur subsequent to the vesting period are recorded as adjustments to compensation costs in the period in which the changes occur 

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options and rsus based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant less estimated forfeitures for awards that vest based on service compensation expense is recognized ratably during the vesting period vesting of certain rsus is also subject to satisfying operating performance conditions at the time that we determine that it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved compensation expense is recorded for such awards 

when recording compensation cost for sharebased awards we are required to estimate the number of awards granted that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates on an ongoing basis we adjust compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revise the forfeiture rate as necessary 

the fair value of unvested cashsettled unit awards unvested sars and all stock options are estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model because the blackscholes optionpricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of awards the riskfree interest rate is based on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award for cashsettled award units and rsus the expected term is the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the award for sars the expected term is estimated to be the contractual term of the award for stock options the expected term is estimated to be the period from the date of grant through the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical realized volatility of our common stock and considers other factors deemed relevant the dividend yield is assumed to be 0 because we have no present intention to pay dividends 

the fair value of rsus is determined based on the fair value of our common stock as of the grant date 

sharebased compensation expense is recorded as a component of selling general and administrative expense we classify as a current liability the intrinsic value of cashsettled award units and sars that are vested or will become vested within one year 

excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options are reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

2009 impairment testing 

the majority of our goodwill balance is the result of the newhouse transaction in 2008 and a transaction with advancenewhouse and cox communications holdings inc in 2007 the “cox transaction” as a result of the newhouse transaction we allocated 18 billion of goodwill previously allocated to dhc’s equity investment in dch and 251 million of goodwill for the basis differential between the carrying value of dhc’s and advancenewhouse’s investments in dch to our reporting units the formation of dch as part of the cox transaction required “pushdown” accounting of each shareholder’s basis in dch the result was the pushdown of 46 billion of additional goodwill previously recorded on the investors’ books to dch reporting units 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in accordance with fasb asc topic 350 intangibles—goodwill and other “asc 350” on november 30 2009 under the guidelines established by fasb asc topic 280 segment reporting “asc 280” we have aggregated our operating segments into the following three reportable segments us networks international networks and commerce education and other however the goodwill impairment analysis under the requirements of asc 350 is performed at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is the same as or one level below an operating segment as defined in asc 280 

the following table presents our goodwill balances by reporting unit as of december 31 2009 and 2008 in millions 

 

 we utilized a discounted cash flow “dcf” model and market approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the dcf model utilizes projected financial results for each reporting unit the projected financial results are created from critical assumptions and estimates which are based on management’s business plans and historical trends the market approach relies on data from publicly traded guideline companies determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and relevant comparable company earnings multiples 

a summary of the critical assumptions utilized for our annual impairment tests in 2009 and 2008 are outlined below we believe this information coupled with our sensitivity analysis considering reporting units whose fair value would not exceed carrying value following a hypothetical reduction in fair value of 10 and 20 provide relevant information to understand our goodwill impairment testing and evaluate our goodwill balances 

  

during 2009 we did not change our reporting units however discovery kids a component of the other us networks reporting unit was deconsolidated in 2009 and was not included in the 2009 impairment testing for the annual goodwill impairment test performed on november 30 2009 we did not significantly change the methodology from 2008 to determine the fair value of our reporting units due to the improvement in the global economic environment we made changes to certain of the assumptions utilized in the dcf model for 2009 compared with the prior year generally we decreased discount rates in our 2009 dcf calculations our assumed growth rates in 2009 were generally consistent with growth rates used in 2008 the following is a summary analysis of the significant assumptions used in our dcf model as well as a sensitivity analysis on the impact of changes in certain assumptions to our overall conclusion concerning impairment of our goodwill balances 

discount rate  the discount rate represents the expected return on capital each of the us networks’ reporting units used a discount rate of 11 for 2009 which represents a decrease from a rate of 12 utilized in 2008 the international networks’ reporting units’ discount rates were a weighted average of 14 and 16 for the years 2009 and 2008 respectively for our remaining reporting units discount rates were a weighted average of 15 for the years 2009 and 2008 we used the average interest rate of a 20year government security over a one year period to determine the risk free rate in our weighted average cost of capital calculation the difference between our discount rate and the risk free rate was 7 and 8 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

growth assumptions projected annual growth is primarily driven by assumed advertising sales and cable subscriber trends offset by expected expenses other considerations include historical performance and anticipated economic conditions for the current period and long term 

we use a five year period of assumed cash flows to assess shortterm company net free cash flow for our dcf calculation the projected revenue growth for the us networks’ reporting units was a weighted average of 5 for both the 2009 and 2008 dcf calculations us networks experienced actual revenue growth of 4 and 10 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the projected expense growth for the us networks’ reporting units was a weighted average of 1 in 2009 compared with 5 in 2008 the projected revenue growth for the international networks’ reporting units was a weighted average of 7 for both the 2009 and 2008 dcf calculations international networks experienced actual revenue growth of 10 and 12 in 2009 and 2008 respectively when excluding the impacts of foreign exchange the projected expense growth for the international networks’ reporting units was a weighted average of 3 in 2009 compared with 6 in 2008 the projected revenue growth for our other reporting units was a weighted average of 5 for the 2009 dcf calculation compared with 4 in 2008 other reporting units experienced actual revenue decreases of 10 and 19 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the historical revenue declines for our other reporting units are not relevant due to the transition of our commerce business to a licensing model in 2009 and the closure of retail stores in the second half of 2007 the projected expense growth for other reporting units was 2 in 2009 compared with a decrease of 1 in 2008 

we used a weighted average terminal value growth rate of 4 for the us networks’ reporting units in both our 2009 and 2008 dcf calculations we used a weighted average terminal value growth rate of 4 and 5 for the international networks’ reporting units in our 2009 and 2008 dcf calculations respectively we used a weighted average terminal value growth rate of 6 and 7 for our other reporting units in our 2009 and 2008 dcf calculations respectively the terminal values used in our dcf model are calculated using the dividend discount model as a result the terminal values used for our reporting units are a function of their respective discount rates and terminal value growth rates 

market approach assumptions  we used earnings before interest depreciation and amortization “ebitda” revenue and price per subscriber multiples to estimate fair value using a market approach the us networks’ reporting units’ weighted average ebitda multiples were 13 and 10 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the international networks’ reporting units’ weighted average ebitda multiples were 13 and 12 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the us networks’ reporting units made up 75 of the fair value of our company in both 2009 and 2008 at the date of impairment testing the carrying value of our us networks’ reporting units made up 74 and 77 of the carrying value of net assets allocated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2009 and 2008 respectively the international networks’ reporting units made up 24 and 23 of the fair value of our company in 2009 and 2008 respectively the carrying value of the international networks’ reporting units made up 25 and 22 of the carrying value of net assets allocated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2009 and 2008 respectively the fair value of our other reporting units made up 1 and 2 of the fair value of our company in 2009 and 2008 respectively the carrying value of our other reporting units made up 1 of the carrying value of net assets allocated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in both 2009 and 2008 

impairment as of november 30 2009 the fair value of our css and antenna audio reporting units did not exceed their carrying values due to declines in operating cash flows as a result of adverse market conditions we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test as required by asc 350 which requires calculation of the reporting units implied goodwill and comparing to the book value of goodwill and determined that 6 million of goodwill of the antenna audio reporting unit was impaired the change in the goodwill balance from december 31 2008 to the date of the 2009 impairment test was due to foreign exchange the impairment was recorded as a component of restructuring and impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations 

  

sensitivity analysis  in order to analyze the sensitivity our assumptions have on our overall impairment assessment we determined the impact that a hypothetical 10 and 20 reduction in fair value would have on our conclusions 

 

  

 reductions of approximately 47 and 51 in the fair value of our largest reporting units discovery channel and tlc respectively would result in their carrying values exceeding their fair values given the reductions required and the assumptions used in our fair value modeling at the time of our impairment review there did not appear to be any likely changes or trigger events that would indicate an impairment of these reporting units 

if changes in the fair value of our reporting units caused the carrying value of a reporting unit to exceed its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be required to be performed to determine the ultimate amount of impairment loss to record 

2010 impairment testing 

we will perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of november 30 2010 unless there is a triggering event which would require the performance of impairment testing before our annual impairment testing date we monitor our anticipated operating performance to ensure that no event has occurred requiring goodwill impairment testing as part of our annual impairment testing or any interim impairment test deemed necessary we will evaluate whether our assumptions and methodologies require changes as a result of the current global economic environment 

the determination of recoverability of goodwill requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows and fair values such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future if different reporting units or different valuation methodologies had been used the impairment test results could have differed 

longlived assets 

longlived assets eg amortizing trademarks customer lists other intangibles and property plant and equipment do not require that an annual impairment test be performed instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale if the intent is to hold the asset for continued use the impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows the asset would be deemed to not be recoverable impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset if the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met eg the asset can be disposed of currently appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an active program to locate a buyer the impairment test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its fair value to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 

significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded longlived asset impairments of 26 million primarily related to our howstuffworkscom business a component of the other us networks reporting unit due to declines in expected operating performance 

the determination of recoverability of longlived assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows fair values and the appropriate grouping of assets such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future if different asset groupings or different valuation methodologies had been used the impairment test results could have differed 

  

income taxes 

income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of investments we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks we use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

interest rates 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements market conditions and other factors our interest expense is exposed to movements in shortterm interest rates of our 34 billion of debt excluding capital leases 20 billion was floating rate debt at december 31 2009 we use derivative instruments including variable to fixed and fixed to variable interest rate instruments to modify this exposure the variable to fixed interest rate instruments had a notional amount of 18 billion and 23 billion and had a weighted average interest rate of 427 and 468 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the fixed to variable interest rate agreements had a notional amount of 50 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 467 and 790 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively as of december 31 2009 we have a notional amount of 300 million of forward starting variable to fixed interest rate swaps which will start in june 2010 the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts adjusted for our credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risk aggregate a net loss position of 33 million and 107 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

of the total notional amount of 22 billion in interest rate derivatives 18 billion of these derivative instruments are highly effective cash flow hedges the fair value of these hedges at december 31 2009 and 2008 was a net loss position of 17 million and 71 million respectively with changes in the marktomarket value recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss  we do not expect material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve months as of december 31 2009 a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve equal to one percentage point would change the fair value of our interest rate derivative portfolio by approximately 40 million in addition a change of one percentage point in interest rates on our variable rate debt would impact interest expense by approximately 3 million on an annual basis 

we continually monitor our positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions that are counterparties to our derivative instruments and do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties in addition we limit the amount of derivative counterparty credit exposure with any one institution 

refer to note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments 

foreign currency exchange rates 

we continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements when appropriate substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries the majority of our foreign currency exposure is to the british pound and the euro although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting as a result fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows accordingly we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments that change in value as foreign exchange rates change we did not hold significant foreign currency derivative instruments at december 31 2009 at december 31 2008 the notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments was 75 million and the fair value was 5 million

overview 

 

discovery communications inc “discovery” we” “us” or “our” is a leading global media and entertainment company that provides original and purchased programming across multiple distribution platforms in the united states us and approximately 170 other countries with over 100 television networks offering customized programming in 35 languages we also develop and sell consumer and educational products and services as well as media sound services in the us and internationally in addition we own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties and other digital services 

 

we were formed on september 17 2008 in connection with discovery holding company “dhc” and advancenewhouse programming partnership “advancenewhouse” combining their respective ownership interests in discovery communications holding llc “dch” and exchanging those interests with and into discovery the “newhouse transaction” prior to the newhouse transaction dch was a standalone private company which was owned approximately 66 2  3  by dhc and 33 1  3  by advancenewhouse the newhouse transaction was completed as follows 

 

  

as a result of the newhouse transaction we became the successor reporting entity to dhc under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended because advancenewhouse was a onethird owner of ours prior to the completion of the newhouse transaction and is a onethird owner immediately following completion of the newhouse transaction there was no effective change in ownership our convertible preferred stock does not have any special dividend rights and only a de minimis liquidation preference additionally advancenewhouse retains significant participatory special class voting rights with respect to certain matters that could be submitted to a shareholder vote 

 

the following diagrams illustrate at a summary level the ownership interests between us dhc advancenewhouse and dch prior and subsequent to the newhouse transaction the diagrams are in general terms and are not comprehensive they reflect the economic substance of the newhouse transaction but do not precisely reflect the legal and corporate entities used to implement the newhouse transaction additionally the contribution of advancenewhouse’s interest in animal planet lp is not reflected in the diagrams because the value of this contribution was insignificant relative to the value of the overall transaction

structure subsequent to the newhouse transaction and amc spinoff 

 

 

our media content spans nonfiction genres including science exploration survival natural history sustainability of the environment technology anthropology paleontology history space archaeology health and wellness engineering adventure lifestyles and current events this type of programming tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time as a result our content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages as well as the creation of local programming tailored to individual market preferences 

 

our content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming offers a compelling reason for advertisers to purchase time on our channels our audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators directtohome or “dth” satellite operators telephone and communications companies and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers 

 

we have an extensive library of over 100000 hours of programming and footage that provides a highquality source of content for creating new services and launching into new markets and onto new platforms we generally own most or all rights to the majority of this programming and footage which enables us to exploit our library to launch new brands and services into new markets quickly without significant incremental 

spending programming can be reedited and updated to provide in a costeffective manner topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world 

 

in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded channels we are focused on growing revenue across new distribution platforms including brandaligned web properties mobile devices videoondemand and broadband channels which serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales and provide promotional platforms for our television programming we also operate internet sites such as howstuffworkscom treehuggercom and petfindercom that provide supplemental news information and entertainment aligned with our television programming 

 

we are also exploiting our programming assets to take advantage of the growing demand for high definition hd programming in the us and throughout the world in 2008 we provided hd simulcasts of five of our us networks discovery channel tlc animal planet science channel and planet green in addition to our us hd theater service which was launched in 2002 in 2008 we also expanded our international hd operations to include hd channels in 23 countries outside of the us making us one of the leading international providers of hd programming based on the number of markets we serve we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the accelerating growth in sales of hd televisions and bluray dvd players and the expanding distribution of hd channels around the world where we operate hd simulcasts of our networks we also benefit from the ability to aggregate audiences for advertising sales purposes

commerce education and other 

 

commerce 

 

commerce represents an additional revenue stream for us it also plays an important role in support of our overall strategic objectives by enhancing viewer loyalty through direct interaction with our brands discovery commerce is focused on exploiting our onair brands and increasing the reach of our products through our ecommerce platform and licensing arrangements 

 

the division’s platforms include 

 

  

during the first quarter of 2009 we will begin to operate a new business model to license the directtoconsumer component of our commerce business that includes the ecommerce platform and catalog to a thirdparty company we will receive royalties on merchandise and wholesale payments for dvds sold while the third party will assume management and operational responsibility for discoverystorecom and product development responsibility for merchandise as a result of this new 

license agreement our sales will be recorded on a net sales basis and will result in a decrease in revenues and costs our commerce operations continue to add value to our television assets by reinforcing consumer loyalty and creating opportunities for our advertising and distribution partners 

 

  

education 

 

education offers a suite of curriculumbased tools designed to foster student achievement as well as educator enhancement resources such as assessment services professional development and a nationwide educator community that promotes the integration of media and technology in the classroom education services include 

 

  

education also publishes and distributes content on dvd vhs and cdrom through catalogs an online teacher store and a network of distributors participates in licensing and sponsorship programs with corporate partners and supports our digital initiatives by providing educational content in multiple formats that meet the needs of teachers and students 

 

education also works with corporate partners to create supplemental curriculum programs and to support educationbased student initiatives 

 

creative sound services 

 

creative sound services “css” became a whollyowned subsidiary of ours in september 2008 following the spinoff of amc as part of the newhouse transaction css provides sound music mixing sound effects and other related services to major motion picture studios independent producers broadcast networks cable channels advertising agencies and interactive producers css services are marketed under the brand names toddao sound one soundelux pop sound modern music soundelux design music group and the hollywood edge with facilities in los angeles and new york 

 

content development 

 

our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership maintain innovation and quality leadership and provide value for our distributors and advertising customers our production agreements fall into three categories commissions coproductions and acquisitions commissions refer to programming for which we generally own most or all rights for at least 10 years and in exchange for paying for all production costs retain all editorial control coproductions refer to programs where we retain significant but more limited rights to exploit the programs the rights package retained by us is generally in proportion to the portion of the total project costs covered by us which generally ranges from 2570 of the total project cost coproductions are typically highcost projects for which neither we nor our coproducers wish to bear the 

entire cost or productions in which the producer has already taken on an international broadcast partner acquisitions are license agreements for films or series that have already been produced 

 

as revenue and network distribution grows our program mix has matured from acquired content to sharing in coproductions to full commissions to minimize programming expense in the early stages as an audience base begins to form acquired programming is used to a greater extent and repeated frequently the transition from acquired content provides for more customized use of programming for individual networks and broader rights for reuse on television networks and new platforms 

 

we source content from a wide range of producers building longstanding relationships with some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies as well as consistently developing and encouraging young independent producers we also have longterm relationships with some of the world’s most significant nonfiction program producers including the bbc 

 

the programming schedule on our most widely distributed networks is mostly a mix of highcost “special event” programming combined with miniseries and regular series largescale programming events such as planet earth nefertiti resurrected walking with cavemen and blue planet bring brand prestige favorable media coverage and substantial crosspromotional opportunities for other content platforms given the success of these global programming “tentpoles” we will continue to invest in a mix of programs that have the potential to draw larger audiences while also increasing the investment in regularly scheduled series 

 

we have an extensive library of over 100000 hours of programming and footage that provides a highquality source of programming for debuting new services quickly without significant incremental spending for example we were able to exploit the “longtail” popularity of our extensive nonfiction library of forensics and investigation programming to debut the rebranded investigation discovery channel in january 2008 in 2009 we launched investigation discovery in the uk programming can be reedited and updated to provide topical versions of subject matter in a costeffective manner library development also provides a mechanism to share content around the world and repurpose for display on new digital and mobile platforms 

 

sources of revenue 

 

we earn revenue principally from 1 the receipt of affiliate fees from the global delivery of nonfiction programming pursuant to affiliation agreements with cable television operators directtohome satellite operators and other distributors 2 advertising sales on our television networks and websites and 3 product subscription sales and services in the commerce education and media sound services businesses no single customer represented more than 10 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

distribution revenue 

 

distribution revenue represented 48 of our consolidated total revenue in 2008 distribution revenue in the us represented 45 of us networks revenue and international distribution fees represented 62 of international networks revenue in 2008 distribution revenue is generated through affiliation agreements with cable satellite and other television distributors which have a typical term of three to seven years these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and package inclusion whether on more widely distributed broader packages or lesserdistributed specialized packages and for payment of a fee to us based on the numbers of subscribers that receive our networks upon the launch of a new channel we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel such payments are referred to as “launch incentives” or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time we have longterm contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite operators around the world including the largest operators in the us and major international distributors in the us over 90 of distribution revenue comes from the top eight distributors with whom we have agreements that expire at various times beginning in 2010 through 2017 outside of the us we have agreements with numerous distributors with no individual agreement representing more than 10 of our international distribution revenue 

advertising revenue 

 

advertising revenue comprised 41 of our consolidated total revenue in 2008 advertising revenue in the us represented 51 of us networks revenue and international advertising revenue represented 29 of international networks revenue in 2008 we typically build network brands by securing as broad a subscriber base as possible after obtaining sufficient distribution to provide an attractive platform for advertising we increase our investment in programming and marketing to build audience share and drive strong ratings performance in order to increase advertising sales opportunities advertising revenue generated by each program service depends on the number of subscribers receiving the service viewership demographics the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by thirdparty research companies such as the nielsen company revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality and marketbased variations advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters revenue can also fluctuate due to the popularity of particular programs and viewership ratings in some cases advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that may require us to provide additional advertising time or refunds if the guarantees are not met 

 

we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets in the upfront market advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by buying in advance often receive discounted rates in the scatter market advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the ads will be run and often pay a premium the mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing demand for advertising time and economic conditions 

 

our two flagship networks discovery channel and tlc target key demographics that have historically been considered attractive to advertisers notably viewers in the 1854 age range who are viewed as having significant spending power discovery channel’s target audience skews toward male viewers while tlc and animal planet target female viewers providing a healthy gender balance in our portfolio for distribution and advertising clients 

 

we benefit by having a portfolio of networks appealing to a broad range of demographics this allows us to create advertising packages that exploit the strength of our large networks to benefit smaller niche or targeted networks and networks on digital tiers utilizing the strength of our diverse networks coupled with our online and digital platforms we seek to create innovative programming initiatives and multifaceted campaigns for the benefit of a wide variety of companies and organizations who desire to reach key audience demographics unique to each network we deliver customized integrated marketing campaigns to clients worldwide by catering to the special needs of multiregional advertisers who are looking for integrated campaigns that move beyond traditional spot advertising to include sponsorships product placements and other opportunities 

 

we also generate advertising revenue from our websites we sell advertising on our websites both on a standalone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks 

 

commerce education and other revenue 

 

commerce education and other derives revenue principally from the sale of products online and through our catalogs licensing royalties subscriptions to our educational streaming services and other revenue including media sound services as part of our commerce business we have a domestic consumer products licensing business which licenses our brands in connection with merchandise videogames and publishing we are generally paid a royalty based upon a percentage of our licensees’ wholesale revenues with an advance against future expected royalties 

 

ecommerce and catalog sales are highly seasonal with a majority of the sales occurring in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season licensing revenue may vary from period to period depending upon the popularity of the properties available for license and the popularity of licensed products in a particular period subscription sales to our educational streaming services are primarily sold at the beginning of each school year as school budgets are appropriated and approved the revenue derived from the subscription agreements are generally recognized over the school year education also provides products that are sold throughout the school year 

during the first quarter of 2009 we will begin to operate a new business model to license the directtoconsumer component of our commerce business that includes the ecommerce platform and catalog to a thirdparty company as a result we will receive royalties on merchandise and wholesale payments for dvds sold while the third party will assume management and operational responsibility for discoverystorecom and product development responsibility for merchandise 

 

operating expenditures 

 

our principal operating costs consist of programming expense sales and marketing expense personnel expense and general and administrative expenses content amortization expense is our largest expense category representing 28 of our 2008 consolidated operating expenses as investment in maintaining highquality editorial and production values is a key differentiator for our content in connection with creating original content we incur production costs associated with acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative talent including actors writers and producers we also incur higher production costs when filming in hd versus standard definition we incur sales and marketing expense to promote brand recognition and to secure quality distribution channels worldwide 

 

regulatory matters 

 

our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of us federal state and local government authorities and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of local countries and international bodies such as the european union programming networks such as those owned by us are regulated by the fcc in certain respects if they are affiliated with a cable television operator other fcc regulations although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators affect programming networks indirectly the rules regulations policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change these descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses 

 

program access 

 

the fcc’s program access rules prevent a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest under fcc rules such as those owned by us from entering into exclusive contracts for programming with a cable operator and from discriminating among competing multichannel video programming distributors “mvpds” in the price terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of programming these rules also permit mvpds to initiate complaints to the fcc against program suppliers if an mvpd is unable to obtain rights to programming on nondiscriminatory terms 

 

effect of “mustcarry” requirements 

 

the cable act of 1992 imposed “must carry” regulations on cable systems requiring them to carry the signals of local broadcast television stations direct broadcast satellite “dbs” systems are also subject to their own must carry rules the fcc recently adopted an order requiring cable systems following the anticipated end of analog television broadcasting in june 2009 to carry the digital signals of local television stations that have must carry status and to carry the same signal in analog format or to carry the signal in digital format alone provided that all subscribers have the necessary equipment to view the broadcast content the fcc’s implementation of these “mustcarry” obligations requires cable and dbs operators to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space this reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and dbs operators 

 

obscenity restrictions 

 

cable operators and other distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks 

closed captioning and advertising restrictions on children’s programming 

 

certain of our networks must provide closedcaptioning of programming for the hearing impaired and our programming and internet websites intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising 

 

regulation of the internet 

 

we operate several internet websites which we use to distribute information about and supplement our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services internet services are now subject to regulation in the united states relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13 including the federal child online protection act copa and the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act canspam in addition a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering such issues as user privacy child safety data security advertising pricing content copyrights and trademarks access by persons with disabilities distribution taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services in addition to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the united states the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions including without limitation consumer protection privacy advertising data retention intellectual property and content limitations may impose additional compliance obligations on us 

 

competition 

 

cable and satellite network programming is a highly competitive business in the united states and worldwide our cable and satellite networks and websites generally compete for advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television networks online and mobile outlets radio programming and print media our networks and websites also compete for their target audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided to viewers including broadcast networks local overtheair television stations competitors’ pay and basic cable television networks payperview and videoondemand services online activities and other forms of news information and entertainment our networks also compete with other television networks for distribution and affiliate fees derived from distribution agreements with cable television operators satellite operators and other distributors our commerce and education division also operates in highly competitive industries with our ecommerce and catalogue business competing with brick and mortar and online retailers and our education business competing with other providers of educational products to schools including providers with longstanding relationships such as scholastic 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 4000 employees approximately 3000 of our employees were employed in the united states with the remaining 1000 employed outside the united states over 250 of css’ creative and technical personnel are subject to one of css’ collective bargaining agreements with the international alliance of theatrical stage employees there are no active grievances strikes or work stoppages and we believe our relations with our union and nonunion employees are strong 

 

intellectual property 

 

our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming websites and other content trademarks in brands names and logos domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds 

 

we are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content are of primary importance to protect our intellectual property assets we rely upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition trade secret and internetdomain name statutes and laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign 

territories policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not always prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of our intellectual property we seek to limit that threat through a combination of approaches 

 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations in addition piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk in addition to the other information contained in this report you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities 

 

our business would be adversely affected if general economic conditions further weaken 

 

the current economic downturn in the united states and in other regions of the world in which we operate could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenue and earnings we derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on our networks expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns the current economic conditions and any continuation of these adverse conditions may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities a decrease in advertising expenditures likely would have an adverse effect on our business the decline in economic conditions has impacted consumer discretionary spending such a reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television subscriptions particularly to the more expensive digital service tiers which could lead to a decrease in our distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for advertising 

 

our success is dependent upon us and foreign audience acceptance of our programming and other entertainment content which is difficult to predict 

 

the production and distribution of pay television programs and other entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content and programming that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general viewers in special interest groups viewers in specific demographic categories and viewers in various 

overseas marketplaces the commercial success of our programming and other content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing programs and other content available in the applicable marketplace at the same time other factors including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities general economic conditions piracy digital and ondemand distribution and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both i the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive and ii the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors consequently reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect all of our revenue streams 

 

the loss of our affiliation agreements or renewals with less advantageous terms could cause our revenue to decline 

 

because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn distribute them to consumers we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive such as channel placement and programming package inclusion widely distributed broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed specialized programming packages and for payment of a license fee to us based on the numbers of subscribers that receive our networks these persubscriber payments represent a significant portion of our revenue our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies from market to market and from distributor to distributor and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed on terms that are as favorable to us as those in effect today a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks could adversely affect our distribution revenue such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue 

 

consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationship with programmers including us the two largest us cable television system operators provide service to approximately 35 of us households receiving cable or satellite television service and the two largest satellite television operators provide service to an additional 26 of such households we currently have agreements in place with the major us cable and satellite operators which expire at various times beginning in 2010 through 2017 a failure to secure a renewal or a renewal on less favorable terms may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected in addition many of the overseas markets in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our programming and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue 

 

we operate in increasingly competitive industries 

 

the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive we compete with other programming networks for advertising distribution and viewers we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment such as home video movies periodicals and online and mobile activities in particular websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth a portion of which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers in addition there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated our online businesses compete for users and advertising in the enormously broad and diverse market of free internetdelivered services our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products our educational video business competes with other providers of educational products to schools our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content access 

our niche viewerships with appealing categoryspecific programming adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations both domestic and foreign 

 

programming services like ours and the distributors of our services including cable operators satellite operators and internet companies are highly regulated by us federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies including the fcc as well as by state and local governments in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video programming business see discussion under “business — regulatory matters” above the us congress the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect the operations of our us media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate for example any changes to the laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that are carried by cable television operators or our other distributors may result in less capacity for other programming services such as our networks which could adversely affect our revenue 

 

similarly the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have in varying degrees government laws and regulations governing our businesses programming businesses are subject to regulation on a country by country basis changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope 

 

increased programming production and content costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

one of our most significant areas of expense is the licensing and production of content in connection with creating original content we incur production costs associated with among other things acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative talent including actors writers and producers we also incur higher production costs when filming in hd than standard definition the costs of producing programming have generally increased in recent years these costs may continue to increase in the future which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

disruption or failure of satellites and facilities and disputes over supplier contracts on which we depend to distribute our programming could adversely affect our business 

 

we depend on transponders on satellite systems to transmit our media networks to cable television operators and other distributors worldwide the distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks we obtain satellite transponder capacity pursuant to longterm contracts and other arrangements with thirdparty vendors which expire at various times through 2019 even with backup and redundant systems transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters or other conditions that may impair onground uplinks or downlinks or as a result of an impairment of a satellite currently there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming if a disruption or failure occurs we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we must respond to and capitalize on rapid changes in new technologies and distribution platforms including their effect on consumer behavior in order to remain competitive and exploit new opportunities 

 

technology in the video telecommunications and data services industry is changing rapidly we must adapt to advances in technologies distribution outlets and content transfer and storage to ensure that our content remains desirable and widely available to our audiences while protecting our intellectual property interests we may not have the right and may not be able to secure the right to distribute some of our licensed content across these or any other new platforms and must adapt accordingly the ability to anticipate 

and take advantage of new and future sources of revenue from these technological developments will affect our ability to expand our business and increase revenue 

 

similarly we also must adapt to changing consumer behavior driven by technological advances such as videoondemand and a desire for more usergenerated and interactive content devices that allow consumers to view our entertainment content from remote locations or on a timedelayed basis and technologies which enable users to fastforward or skip advertisements may cause changes in audience behavior that could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenue if we cannot ensure that our content is responsive to the lifestyles of our target audiences and capitalize on technological advances there could be a negative effect on our business 

 

our revenue and operating results are subject to seasonal and cyclical variations 

 

our business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience some seasonality due to among other things seasonal advertising patterns seasonal influences on people’s viewing habits and a heavy concentration of sales in our commerce business during the fourth quarter for example due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenue than the first and third quarters in addition advertising revenue in evennumbered years benefits from political advertising if a shortterm negative impact on our business were to occur during a time of high seasonal demand there could be a disproportionate effect on our operating results for the year 

 

we continue to develop new products and services for evolving markets there can be no assurance of the success of these efforts due to a number of factors some of which are beyond our control 

 

there are substantial uncertainties associated with our efforts to develop new products and services for evolving markets and substantial investments may be required initial timetables for the introduction and development of new products and services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as the development of competitive alternatives rapid technological change regulatory changes and shifting market preferences may cause new markets to move in unanticipated directions 

 

risks associated with our international operations could harm our financial condition 

 

our networks are offered worldwide inherent economic risks of doing business in international markets include among other things longer payment cycles foreign taxation and currency exchange risk as we continue to expand the provision of our products and services to overseas markets we cannot assure you whether these risks and uncertainties will harm our results of operations 

 

our international operations may also be adversely affected by export and import restrictions other trade barriers and acts of disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation nationalization war insurrection terrorism or general social or political unrest or other hostilities 

 

the loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue 

 

our business depends upon the continued efforts abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences if we fail to retain these individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base our revenue could be adversely affected 

piracy of our entertainment content including digital piracy may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our business and profitability 

 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content we are fundamentally a content company and piracy of our brands dvds cable television and other programming digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly affect us piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the us it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of programming into digital formats which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content 

 

financial market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

 

the recent changes in us and global financial and equity markets including market disruptions and tightening of the credit markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in significant part on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing 

 

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 37 billion of consolidated debt our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness in addition we draw down our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course which has the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

 25 

 

restrictive covenants in the loan agreements for our revolving credit facility and term loans and the note purchase agreements governing our private placement notes could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

 

the loan agreements for our revolving credit facility and term loans and the note purchase agreements governing the terms of our private placement notes contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and note purchase agreements require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants 

 

we are a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments 

 

our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash we are a holding company and our sources of cash include our available cash balances net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments availability under any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future the ability of our operating subsidiaries including discovery communications llc to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory regulatory or contractual restrictions including restrictions in our credit facility to which they may be or may become subject 

 

we cannot be certain that we will be successful in integrating any businesses we may acquire in the future 

 

our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions in selected markets integration of new businesses may present significant challenges including realizing economies of scale in programming and network operations eliminating duplicative overheads and integrating networks financial systems and operational systems we cannot assure you that with respect to any acquisition we will realize anticipated benefits or successfully integrate any acquired business with existing operations in addition while we intend to implement appropriate controls and procedures as acquired companies are integrated we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies’ disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting as required by us federal securities laws and regulations until we have fully integrated them 

 

our directors overlap with those of liberty media corporation and certain related persons of advancenewhouse which may lead to conflicting interests 

 

our elevenperson board of directors includes four persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media corporation “liberty” including john c malone the chairman of the board of liberty three persons who are currently members of the board of directors liberty global inc “liberty global” also including mr malone who is chairman of the board of liberty global and three designees of advancenewhouse including robert j miron the chairman of advancenewhouse and steven a miron the chief executive officer of advancenewhouse both liberty and the parent company of advancenewhouse own interests in a range of media communications and entertainment businesses liberty does not own any interest in us mr malone beneficially owns stock of liberty representing approximately 33 of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock owns shares representing approximately 34 of the aggregate voting power of liberty global and owns shares representing approximately 23 of the aggregate voting 

power other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors of our outstanding stock mr malone controls approximately 32 of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors assuming that the preferred stock awarded by advancenewhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock those of our directors who are also directors of liberty or liberty global own liberty or liberty global stock and stock incentives and own our stock and stock incentives advancenewhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a convertible preferred stock and two directors include its chairman robert j miron and its chief executive officer steven a miron the advancenewhouse series a convertible preferred stock which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors represents approximately 26 of the voting power of our outstanding shares the series a convertible preferred stock also grants advancenewhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions including fundamental changes to our business the issuance of additional capital stock mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions these ownership interests andor business positions could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us liberty liberty global andor advancenewhouse for example there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we on the one hand or liberty liberty global andor advancenewhouse on the other hand look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other 

 

the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders likewise those persons who serve in similar capacities at liberty liberty global or advancenewhouse have fiduciary duties to those companies therefore such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies although the terms of any transactions or agreements will be established based upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case where the parties are at arms’ length 

 

we may compete with liberty for business opportunities 

 

liberty owns interests in various us and international programming companies that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign programming services that may compete with the programming services we offer we have no rights in respect of us or international programming opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries or liberty and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders because we and liberty have overlapping directors the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity including liberty for which such individual serves as a director or officer or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries unless x such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and y such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged 

 

the personal educational media lifelong learning and travel industry investments by john s hendricks a common stock director and our founder may conflict with or compete with our business activities 

 

our founder john s hendricks manages his nondiscovery personal business investments through hendricks investment holdings llc “hih” a delaware limited liability company of which he is the sole owner and member hih owns a travel club and travelrelated properties including a resort in gateway colorado with plans to create a learning academy for guests that includes online and advanced media offerings in the area of informal and lifelong learning certain video productions and offerings of this academy may compete with our educational media offerings we and the academy may enter into a business arrangement for the offering of our video products for sale by the academy andor for the jointproduction of new educational media products 

through hih mr hendricks owns a number of business interests in the automotive field some of which are involved in programming offered by us in particular the “turbo” programming series we offer 

 

from time to time hih or its subsidiaries may enter into transactions with us or our subsidiaries although the terms of any such transactions or agreements will be established based upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case where the parties are at arms’ length 

 

it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders 

 

certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable these provisions include the following 

 

  

  

  

we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover while the plan is designed to guard 

against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us 

 

holders of any single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that series of common stock 

 

principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock under delaware law the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders including the holders of all series of our common stock principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders as a result in some circumstances our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock under the principles of delaware law referred to above stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders 

 

the exercise by advancenewhouse of its registration rights could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

as part of the newhouse transaction advancenewhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock issued to advancenewhouse in the newhouse transaction advancenewhouse’s preferred stock is convertible into a number of shares equal to onehalf of the number of shares of common stock that were issued to former dhc stockholders in the merger subject to antidilution adjustments the registration rights which are immediately exercisable are transferrable with the sale or transfer by advancenewhouse of blocks of shares representing 10 or more of the preferred stock it received in the newhouse transaction the exercise of the registration rights and subsequent sale of possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

 

we will not be fully subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 until the end of 2009 if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting our management may not be able to provide the requisite certifications and our auditors may issue adverse attestations which could among other things jeopardize the market’s confidence in our financial results 

 

as dhc accounted for its investment in dch as an equity affiliate to date discovery has not been subject to the disclosure and internal controls for financial reporting requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 we will not be subject to those requirements until the end of 2009 in the interim we will be required to document evaluate and test and possibly remediate our system of internal control over financial reporting as a result we expect to incur expenses and diversion of management’s time throughout this coming year we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations if we are not able to implement the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance management may not be able to provide the requisite certifications and our auditors may issue adverse attestations which could harm investors’ confidence in our financial results and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the sec or the financial industry regulatory authority any such action could cause our stock price to fall 

 

john c malone and advancenewhouse will each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders 

 

john c malone and advancenewhouse beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 23 and 26 respectively of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock other than voting power relating to the election of directors with respect to the election of directors mr malone is expected to control approximately 32 of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight 

common stock directors and assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advancenewhouse the an preferred stock has not been converted into shares of our common stock the an preferred stock carries with it the right to designate the three preferred stock directors to our board subject to certain conditions but will not vote with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors also under the terms of the an preferred stock advancenewhouse has special voting rights with respect to certain enumerated matters including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws fundamental changes in our business mergers and other business combinations certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock although there is no stockholder agreement voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr malone and advancenewhouse by virtue of their respective holdings each of mr malone and advancenewhouse likely will have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders

introduction 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition cash flows and results of operations this discussion is organized as follows 

 

  

 37 

 

  

overview 

 

we are a leading global media and entertainment company that provides original and purchased programming across multiple distribution platforms in the united states and approximately 170 other countries including television networks offering customized programming in 35 languages our strategy is to optimize the distribution ratings and profit potential of each of our branded channels we own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties and other digital services and develop and sell consumer and educational products and media sound services in the united states and internationally we operate through three divisions 1 us networks 2 international networks and 3 commerce education and other 

 

our media content is designed to target key audience demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our channels audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators directtohome or “dth” satellite operators and other content distributors to deliver our programming to their customers the current economic conditions and any continuation of these adverse conditions may adversely affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter their current spending priorities 

 

in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for our branded channels we are focused on growing revenue across new distribution platforms including brandaligned web properties mobile devices videoondemand and broadband channels which serve as additional outlets for advertising and affiliate sales and provide promotional platforms for our programming we also operate internet sites such as howstuffworkscom providing supplemental news information and entertainment content that are aligned with our television programming 

 

we will continue to incur incremental legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we will incur costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs associated with corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are incurring additional costs to prepare for the management attestation requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the related attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm to which we will first be subject in 2009 

 

us networks 

 

us networks is our largest division which owns and operates 11 cable and satellite channels including discovery channel tlc and animal planet as well as a portfolio of website properties and other digital services us networks also provides distribution and advertising sales services for travel channel and distribution services for bbc america and bbc world news us networks derives revenue primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales which comprised 45 and 51 respectively of revenue for this division for the year ended december 31 2008 during each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 discovery channel tlc and animal planet collectively generated more than 73 of us networks total revenue us networks earns distribution fees under multiyear affiliation agreements with cable operators dth operators and other distributors of television programming distribution fees are based on the number of subscribers receiving programming upon the launch of a new channel we may initially pay distributors to carry such channel such payments are referred to as “launch incentives” or may provide the channel to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time launch incentives are amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of revenue over the term of the affiliation agreement us networks sells commercial time on our networks and websites the number of subscribers to our channels the popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising revenue 

 

several of our domestic networks including discovery channel tlc and animal planet are currently distributed to substantially all of the cable television and direct broadcast satellite homes in the us 

accordingly the rate of growth in us distribution revenue in future periods is expected to be less than historical rates our other us networks are distributed primarily on the digital tier of cable systems and equivalent tiers on dth platforms and have been successful in maximizing their distribution within this more limited universe there is however no guarantee that these digital networks will ever be able to gain the distribution levels or advertising rates of our major networks our contractual arrangements with us distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business in 2008 we renewed the distribution agreements with one of our largest distributors 

 

us networks’ largest single cost is the cost of programming including production costs for original programming us networks amortizes the cost of original or purchased programming based on the expected realization of revenue resulting in an accelerated amortization for discovery channel tlc and animal planet and straightline amortization over three to five years for the remaining networks 

 

international networks 

 

international networks manages a portfolio of channels led by the discovery channel and animal planet brands that are distributed in virtually every paytelevision market in the world through an infrastructure that includes major operational centers in london singapore new delhi and miami international networks’ regional operations cover most major markets including the uk europe middle east and africa “emea” asia latin america and india international networks currently operates over 100 unique distribution feeds in 35 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities most of the division’s channels are wholly owned by us with the exception of 1 the international animal planet channels which are generally joint ventures in which the british broadcasting corporation “bbc” owns 50 2 people  arts which operates in latin america and iberia as a 5050 joint venture with the bbc and 3 several channels in japan canada and poland which operate as joint ventures with strategically important local partners 

 

similar to us networks the primary sources of revenue for international networks are distribution fees and advertising sales and the primary cost is programming international networks executes a localization strategy by offering high quality shared programming with us networks customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds distribution revenue represents approximately 62 of the division’s operating revenue and continues to deliver growth in markets with the highest potential for pay television expansion 

 

advertising sales are increasingly important to the division’s financial success international television markets vary in their stages of development some notably the uk are among the more advanced digital multichannel television markets in the world while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital we believe there is growth in many international markets including latin america and central and eastern europe that are in the early stage of pay tv evolution in developing pay tv markets we expect to see advertising revenue growth from subscriber growth our localization strategy and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay tv in relatively mature markets such as the uk the growth dynamic is changing increased penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid growth in those markets instead growth in advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and advertising pricing on our existing paytv networks and launching new services either in paytv or free television environments one such new launch came in early 2006 when the company acquired a broadlydistributedfreetoair cable channel in germany and relaunched it as dmax another launch will come in 2009 when we will launch a digital terrestrial channel in the uk on the free platform known as freeview which now has over 10 million homes neither of these channels generate distribution fees but both are broadly distributed enough to have strong advertising sales potential 

 

our international businesses are subject to a number of risks including fluctuations in currency exchange rates regulatory issues and political instability changes in any of these areas could adversely affect the performance of the international networks 

 

international networks’ priorities include maintaining a leadership position in nonfiction and certain fictional entertainment in international markets and continuing to grow and improve the performance of the 

international operations these priorities will be achieved through expanding local advertising sales capabilities creating licensing and digital growth opportunities and improving operating efficiencies by strengthening programming and promotional collaboration between us and international network groups 

 

commerce education and other 

 

during 2007 dch evaluated its commerce business and made the decision to transition from running brickandmortar retail locations to leveraging its products through retail arrangements and an ecommerce and catalog platform in the third quarter of 2007 dch completed the closing of its 103 mallbased and standalone discovery channel stores as a result of the store closures our asadjusted results of operations have been prepared to reflect the retail store business as discontinued operations accordingly the revenue costs and expenses of the retail store business have been excluded from the respective captions in our financial statements and have been reported as discontinued operations 

 

in february 2009 we announced our plan to transition our commerce business to a royalty model thereby providing for growth in profitability and reducing the financial risk of holding significant product inventories as such we will outsource the commerce directtoconsumer operations including our commerce website related marketing product development and fulfillment to a third party in exchange for royalties we expect to complete the transition in the second quarter of 2009 our new structure for our commerce business will enable us to continue offering high quality discovery bluray and standard definition dvd programming as well as many merchandise categories leveraging both licensed and make and sell products although we expect this new structure to facilitate growth in operating income we expect an initial compression in topline revenue contribution as well as a reduction in direct operating expenses in 2009 commerce will continue to grow our established brand and home video licensing businesses to further expand our national presence in key retailers our commerce operations continue to add value to our television assets by reinforcing consumer loyalty and creating opportunities for our advertising and distribution partners 

 

our education business will continue to focus on our directtoschool streaming distribution subscription services as well as our benchmark student assessment services publishing and distributing hardcopy content through a network of distribution channels including online catalog and dealers our education business also participates in a growing sponsorship and global brand and content licensing business 

 

with the completion of the newhouse transaction the operating results of the creative sound services “css” businesses which provide sound music mixing sound effects and other related services under brand names such as sound one pop sound soundelux and todd ao are reported in the commerce education and other segment for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

the newhouse transaction 

 

on september 17 2008 we were formed as a result of dhc and advancenewhouse programming partnership “advancenewhouse” combining their respective interests in discovery and exchanging those interests with the company the “newhouse transaction” the newhouse transaction provided among other things for the combination of dhc’s 66 2  3  interest with advancenewhouse’s 33 1  3  interest in dch the newhouse transaction was completed as follows 

 

 40 

  

as a result of the newhouse transaction we became the successor reporting entity to dhc under the exchange act because advancenewhouse was a onethird owner of discovery prior to the completion of the newhouse transaction and is a onethird owner of us immediately following completion of the newhouse transaction there was no effective change in ownership our convertible preferred stock does not have any special dividend rights and only a de minimis liquidation preference additionally advancenewhouse retains significant participatory special class voting rights with respect to certain matters that could be submitted to stockholder vote pursuant to fasb technical bulletin 855 issues relating to accounting for business combinations for accounting purposes the newhouse transaction was treated as a nonsubstantive merger and therefore the newhouse transaction was recorded at the investor’s historical basis 

 

for financial reporting purposes we are the successor reporting entity to dhc because there is no effective change in ownership in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 51 paragraph 11 both dhc and dch will be consolidated in our financial statements as if the transaction had occurred january 1 2008 the presentation of the dch financial statements in accordance with us gaap includes the results of dch’s operations as an equity method investment for the period prior to january 1 2008 for purposes of analyzing dch’s business in this management’s discussion and analysis we have presented our consolidated operating results for 2008 consistent with our financial statement presentation while the 2007 results have been presented as if the newhouse transaction occurred on january 1 2007 

 

the following table summarizes the defined terms concerning the various discovery entities included in this analysis 

 

 

 

discovery restructuring and travel channel disposition 

 

on may 14 2007 cox communications holdings inc exchanged its 25 ownership interest in dch for all of the capital stock of a subsidiary of dch that held the travel channel and travelchannelcom and approximately 13 billion in cash the result was an increase in dhc’s proportional ownership of dch from 50 to 66 2  3  consequently dhc’s 2007 earnings in equity interests of dch reflect the change in ownership

the following table represents the comparison of our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 with as adjusted results for the year ended december 31 2007 for purposes of discussion and analysis of our operations 

 

 

revenue  our consolidated revenue increased 240 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 distribution revenue increased 163 million during the year primarily due to international networks subscriber growth combined with annual contract increases for the fully distributed us networks offset by the disposition of travel channel advertising revenue increased 51 million for the period and is primarily attributed to higher pricing and cash sellout rates in us networks other revenue increased 26 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in licensing revenue in the international networks increase in sales of the planet earth dvd through a joint venture and increases in revenue from our representation of the travel channel through our us networks segment offset by a decline in revenue from the direct to consumer business in our commerce education and other business segment 

 

cost of revenue  cost of revenue which includes content amortization and other production related expenses in addition to distribution and merchandising costs decreased 203 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared to 2007 the decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to the effect of content impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2007 of 139 million primarily in us networks coupled with a 76 million decrease in related amortization expense these decreases were partially offset by increases in costs of revenue in the international networks and content impairment related to tlc 

 

selling general  administrative  selling general  administrative expenses which include certain personnel marketing and other general and administrative expenses decreased 203 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 2007 primarily attributable to a 210 million decrease in expenses arising from longterm incentive plans which were partially offset by slight increases in costs incurred in conjunction with dch preparing to become a consolidated subsidiary of ours as a result of the newhouse transaction and an increase in personnel costs in international networks expenses arising from longterm incentive plans are largely related to dch’s unitbased longterm incentive plan the discovery appreciation plan or the “dap” or “ltip” which was modified to reflect our capital structure following the newhouse transaction prior to the newhouse transaction the value of units in the ltip was indexed to the value of dhc series a common stock after the newhouse transaction the units remained outstanding and were converted at the effective time of the newhouse transaction to track changes in the value of our series a common stock the change in unit value of ltip awards outstanding is recorded as expenses arising from longterm incentive plans over the period outstanding primarily due to the decrease in both the dhc series a common stock and our series a common stock price during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a benefit of 69 million to expenses arising from longterm incentive plans in 2008 compared to expenses arising from longterm incentive plans of 141 million for the year ended december 31 2007 in the fourth quarter 2008 eligible new hires and promoted employees received stock options that vest in four equal installments and those employees with ltip units that vest between september 18 2008 and march 14 2009 will receive cashsettled stock appreciation awards that expire in march 2010 we do not intend to make additional cashsettled stock appreciation awards except as may be required by contract or to employees in countries where stock option awards are not permitted 

 

depreciation and amortization  the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2008 is due to an increase in intangible assets resulting from the reclassification of dhc intangibles following the newhouse transaction and the howstuffworkscom acquisition 

 

asset impairment  during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a writeoff of intangible assets of 30 million related to our howstuffworkscom business this writeoff of intangible assets was due to the decline in the cash flows projected to be generated by the howstuffworkscom business during the second quarter of 2007 dch recorded an asset impairment of 26 million which represents writeoffs of intangible assets related to the education business  

 

exit and restructuring costs  during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 31 million in restructuring charges of which 11 million relates to the relocation and severance costs related to tlc’s repositioning strategy 6 million for the termination of a production group and 6 million due to the closure of our commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution services to thirdparty service providers during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded restructuring charges of 20 million related to a number of organizational and strategic adjustments the purpose of these adjustments was to better align our organizational structure with our new strategic priorities and to respond to continuing changes within the media industry 

gain on disposition of a business  in 2007 we exchanged the capital stock of a subsidiary that held the travel channel and travelchannelcom collectively the “travel business” for cox communications holdings inc’s 25 ownership interest in us and 13 billion in cash the distribution of the travel business which was valued at 575 million resulted in a 135 million taxfree gain 

 

equity in loss income of unconsolidated affiliates  equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 consisted primarily of a 57 million otherthantemporary decline in the value of our equity method investment in hswi coupled with 13 million in equity losses recorded during 2008 which is offset by equity in income from our joint ventures in canada and japan in 2007 we recognized 9 million of equity in income primarily from our joint ventures in canada and japan 

 

interest expense net  on may 14 2007 we entered into a 15 billion term loan in conjunction with the transaction with cox communications holdings inc offset by a 180 million payment for a senior note that matured the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 is primarily a result of the term loan 

 

other net  other net includes our other nonoperating income net of nonoperating expenses as well as unrealized losses from derivative instruments other nonoperating income consisted of a 47 million reduction of a liability related to the value of shares in hswi to be exchanged to its former shareholders which was recorded in december 2008 offsetting this nonoperating income is unrealized losses from derivative transactions unrealized losses from derivative transactions relate primarily to our use of derivative instruments to modify our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt these instruments include a combination of swaps caps collars and other structured instruments as a result of unrealized mark to market adjustments we recognized unrealized losses of 31 million and 9 million during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the foreign exchange hedging instruments used by us are spot forward and option contracts additionally we enter into nondesignated forward contracts to hedge nondollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities 

 

income tax expense  our effective tax rate was 47 and 36 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 differed from the federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to dhc’s recognition of deferred tax expense related to its investment in dch net of tax benefit from intangible amortization related to the spinoff of the travel channel in 2007 which is partially offset by the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of ascent media sound inc other items impacting the effective tax rate include the following our conversion from deducting foreign taxes to claiming foreign tax credits foreign unrecognized tax positions and other miscellaneous items our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 was not materially different than the federal income tax rate of 35 however during this period we benefited from the taxfree treatment of the gain recognized on the disposition of the travel channel and the release of travel channel deferred tax liabilities offset by the tax impact of discontinued operations 

 

minority interests net of tax  minority interests primarily represent our and consolidated entities’ portion of earnings which are allocable to the minority partners as well as the increases and decreases in the estimated redemption value of redeemable interests in subsidiaries the increase in minority interest during the year ended december 31 2008 is primarily a result of our increased profits allocated to minority partners prior to the newhouse transaction and reporting of our financial results in accordance with arb 51 

 

net income loss from discontinued operations net of taxes  summarized financial information included in discontinued operations is as follows 

 

 

 

on september 17 2008 as part of the newhouse transaction dhc completed the spinoff to its shareholders of amc a subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of dhc except for css which provides sound music mixing sound effects and other related services under brand names such as sound one pop sound soundelux and todd ao which businesses remained with us following the completion of the newhouse transaction the amc spinoff was structured such that there was no gain or loss related to the transaction 

 

just prior to the newhouse transaction dhc sold its ownership interests in ascent media cans llc dba accenthealth to accenthealth holdings llc an unaffiliated third party for approximately 119 million in cash it was determined that accenthealth was a noncore asset and the sale of accenthealth was consistent with dhc’s strategy to divest noncore assets dhc recognized a pretax gain of approximately 64 million in connection with the sale of accenthealth which is recorded as a component of discontinued operations as there is no continuing involvement in the operations of amc or accenthealth the financial results of their operations have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets “fas 144” 

operating division results 

 

as noted above our operations are divided into three segments us networks international networks and commerce education and other corporate expenses primarily consist of corporate functions executive management and administrative support services corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives operating results exclude ltip expense restructuring amounts impairments and operating gains consistent with our segment reporting see note 24 

 

 

 

us networks 

 

 

 

as noted above in may 2007 we exchanged our subsidiary holding the travel channel travelchannelcom and approximately 13 billion in cash for cox’s interest in dch accordingly dch’s 2007 results of operations do not include travel channel after may 14 2007 the disposal of travel channel does not meet the requirements for discontinued operations presentation the following table represents us networks results of operations excluding travel channel for all periods although this presentation is not in accordance with us gaap we believe this presentation provides a more meaningful comparison of the us networks results of operations and allows the reader to better understand the us networks ongoing operations 

us networks without travel channel 

 

 

 

since the disposal of travel channel in 2007 did not meet the requirements of discontinued operations presentation and the results of travel channel are not consolidated with dch post transaction the following discussion excludes the results of travel channel for all periods so as to facilitate comparability of the us networks segment data 

 

revenue  total revenue increased 183 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 distribution revenue increased 87 million over the period driven by annual contractual rate increases for fully distributed networks combined with subscription units principally from networks carried on the digital tier distribution revenue includes a onetime 8 million adjustment resulting from improvements in our methodology of estimating accrued revenue for certain distribution operators the adjustment was recorded in its entirety in the second quarter of 2008 and is not material to the current or prior periods contra revenue items included in distribution revenue such as launch amortization and marketing consideration decreased 19 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 this decrease includes 3 million for replacement decoder boxes to support the digitization of an analog transponder recorded as contra revenue in the second quarter of 2007 

 

advertising revenue increased 83 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with the prior year primarily due to higher pricing in the upfront and scatter markets as well as higher cash sellouts which were partially offset by underdelivery of committed audience levels when compared with the corresponding prior year periods 

 

other revenue increased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily from our representation of the travel channel which increased 11 million during the period coupled with an increase of 5 million in revenue from how stuff works which was acquired in december 2007 these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 6 million of international program sales revenue which is now reported in the international networks segment 

 

cost of revenue  for the year ended december 31 2008 cost of revenue decreased 164 million when compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in content amortization expense of 156 million the decrease in content amortization expense was primarily a result of the effect of the 129 million content impairment charge recorded in 2007 following a change in management and related changes in strategy this charge coupled with the related 76 million decrease in content amortization expense was offset by 17 million of content impairment charges for tlc programs following a change in management and related changes in strategy in the second half of 2008 and content amortization expense for new programming on discovery channel tlc planet green and science channel 

 

selling general  administrative expenses  total selling general and administrative expenses increased 29 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 which was primarily a result 

of a 34 million increase in personnel costs primarily driven by continued investment in digital media including acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 this increase was partially offset by decreased marketing expense of 12 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with the corresponding prior year period 

 

international networks 

 

 

 

revenue  total revenue increased 128 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 driven by an increase in distribution revenue of 98 million distribution revenue increased 76 million in emea latin america and asia primarily as a result of a 16 increase in average paying subscription units in addition foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 13 million on distribution revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 

 

advertising revenue increased 6 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 advertising revenue increased 42 million in emea and latin america primarily due to higher viewership combined with an increased subscriber base in most markets worldwide these increases were offset by a 35 million decrease in the uk due to an interpretation of a contract provision resulting in a limitation in our ability to monetize our audience in the uk as well as a deterioration in market conditions advertising revenue decreased 4 million due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange 

 

other revenue increased 24 million mainly due to improvement in licensing and sales of programs primarily in the uk offset by a 2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact 

 

cost of revenue  cost of revenue increased 21 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 driven by a 40 million increase in content amortization expense due to continued investment in original productions and language customization to support additional local feeds for growth in local ad sales partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of 10 million and a reduction in sales commissions of 5 million 

 

selling general  administrative expenses  selling general  administrative expenses decreased 29 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 this decrease was driven by a 26 million reduction in marketing expenditures coupled with the favorable impact of 3 million from foreign exchange 

commerce education and other 

 

 

 

revenue  commerce education and other total revenue decreased 29 million for the year ended 2008 when compared with the prior year a challenging retail environment in 2008 coupled with the success of the planet earth dvd in 2007 contributed to a year over year decline of 48 in revenue from the direct to consumer business which was partially offset by higher licensing revenue education revenue increased by 6 million as the core streaming business continued to grow new revenue streams in licensing and sponsorships were slightly offset by the decline in the hardcopy business as customers shifted to our digital services revenues generated by the css business were relatively flat compared with 2007 

 

cost of revenue  cost of revenue decreased 35 million for the year ended december 31 2008 commensurate with the decrease in commerce’s product revenue coupled with a decrease in education’s content amortization which resulted from the fourth quarter 2007 writeoff of capitalized content costs that were not aligned with education’s product offerings 

 

selling general  administrative expenses  selling general  administrative expenses decreased 3 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower personnel and marketing costs incurred in commerce and education coupled with a 2 million legal expense in 2007 for a legal settlement these decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in selling general and administrative expense from the css business 

 

corporate and intersegment eliminations 

 

 

 

corporate is mainly comprised of ancillary revenue and expenses from a joint venture corporate functions executive management and administrative support services consistent with our segment reporting corporate expenses are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate business segment performance based upon decisions made directly by business segment executives 

 

corporate revenue increased 20 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared with 2007 primarily due to increased ancillary revenue from a joint venture whose primary sales were of the planet earth dvd current sales volume is not expected to continue corporate costs increased 32 million for the year ended december 31 2008 driven by increased costs incurred in conjunction with our preparing to become a public entity as a result of the newhouse transaction and costs related to the startup of own 

results of operations — 2007 vs 2006 

 

prior to the newhouse transaction our consolidated results of operations included 100 of amc’s results of operations general and administrative expenses incurred at the dhc corporate level as well as dhc’s share of earnings of dch the statement of operations reflects the css business in revenue and operating costs and expenses whereas the portion of amc’s businesses that were spunoff as a result of the newhouse transaction are reflected in loss from discontinued operations net of tax 

 

 

 

ascent media’s css group generated revenue primarily from fees for sound music mixing sound effects and other related services under brand names such as sound one pop sound soundelux and todd ao generally these services pertain to the completion of feature films television programs and advertisements these projects normally span from a few days to three months or more in length and fees for these projects typically range from less than 1000 to 200000 

 

expenses related to the corporate support from dhc are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses cost of services and operating expenses consists primarily of production wages facility costs and other direct costs 

 

revenue revenue for css decreased 4 million to 76 million for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared with the same period in 2006 this decrease was driven by smaller feature sound projects and the shut down of certain audio facilities in 2006 

 

total operating costs and expenses total operating costs and expenses decreased 7 million to 84 million for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared with the same period in 2006 this decrease was driven by the reduction of costs that resulted from the shut down of certain audio facilities and related selling general and administrative expenses

net loss from discontinued operations the net loss from discontinued operations increased 56 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from the comparable period in 2006 primarily as a result of a 72 million increase in charges related to the impairment of goodwill on the amc business for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared with the same period in 2006 the increase in goodwill impairment charges was partially offset by an improvement in operating performance on the amc business 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the following table represents a comparison of the components of the statement of cash flows as reported for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively with a reconciliation of historical dch statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2007 our asadjusted statement of cash flows represents the cash flow activities as if the newhouse transaction was completed january 1 2007 the table includes the cash flow activity for amc for both periods including cash provided by operating activities of 28 million cash provided by investing activities of 128 million and cash used in financing activities of 2 million for the year ended december 31 2008 amc cash provided by operating activities was 61 million cash used in investing activities was 15 million and cash provided by financing activities was 2 million for the year ended december 31 2007

sources of cash 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash inhand cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities we anticipate that our cash flows from operations existing cash cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months 

total liquidity at december 31 2008 as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 13 billion of total liquidity comprised of approximately 100 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately 12 billion under our revolving credit facilities in october 2008 we repaid 11 million outstanding under our uk revolving credit facility this facility was closed at our election in december 2008 and would have expired according to its terms in april 2009 

 

cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31 2008 our cash provided by operating activities was 569 million compared to 300 million for the same period as adjusted in 2007 

 

proceeds from the sale of business during the year ended december 31 2008 amc received proceeds of 139 million primarily from the sale of accent health as part of the spinoff of amc 

 

debt facilities our committed debt facilities include two term loans a revolving loan facility and various senior notes payable the second term loan was entered into on may 14 2007 for 15 billion in connection with the cox transaction total commitments of these facilities were 49 billion at december 31 2008 debt outstanding on these facilities aggregated 37 billion at december 31 2008 providing excess debt availability of 12 billion 

 

we currently have fixed the interest rate on the majority of our outstanding debt the anticipated interest payments together with the scheduled principal payments due over the next year are within the available capacity on our committed facilities although we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations and to meet our debt service obligations over the next 12 months we may seek to arrange new financing in the current year in advance of the maturity of our debt facility in 2010 also our current performance on the leverage and other financial maintenance tests is at levels within the established thresholds of the debt agreements indicating some ability to absorb lower than expected operating results and still remain within the covenant limits 

 

dch’s 15 billion term loan is secured by its assets excluding assets held by its subsidiaries the remaining term loan revolving loan and senior notes are unsecured the debt facilities contain covenants that require the respective borrowers to meet certain financial ratios and place restrictions on the payment of dividends sale of assets additional borrowings mergers and purchases of capital stock assets and investments we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december 31 2008 

 

our interest expense associated with our debt facilities is exposed to movements in shortterm interest rates derivative instruments including both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate instruments are used to modify this exposure the variable to fixed interest rate instruments have a notional principal amount of 23 billion and have a weighted average interest rate of 468 against 3 month libor at december 31 2008 the fixed to variable interest rate agreements have a notional principal amount of 50 million and have a weighted average interest rate of 790 against fixed rate private placement debt at december 31 2008 at december 31 2008 we held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of 25 million at a fixed rate of 544 

 

on january 29 2009 we entered into interest rate swap transactions which will become effective on june 30 2010 with a notional amount of 200 million under the swap transactions we will make quarterly payments at a rate of approximately 2935 per annum to the swap counterparties in exchange for a payment approximately equal to the variable rate payable under our credit pledge and security agreement dated as of may 14 2007 the swap transactions terminate on march 31 2014 which is the interest payment date before the maturity date of our credit pledge and security agreement which is may 14 2014 the terms of the swap transactions are governed by customary isda interest rate swap agreements 

 

by entering into these swap transactions we have effectively fixed the interest rate on 200 million of the borrowings under its credit pledge and security agreement at approximately 4935 per annum starting as of june 30 2010

during the year ended december 31 2008 our primary uses of cash were cash payments for content of 803 million mandatory principal payments under our bank facilities and senior notes totaling 257 million

in 2009 we expect our uses of cash to be approximately 445 million for debt repayments 225 million for interest expense and 60 million for capital expenditures we have no material commitments for capital expenditures we will also be required to make payments under our ltip as well as for stock appreciation rights issued under our incentive plan amounts expensed and payable under the ltip are dependent on future annual calculations of unit values which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price changes in units outstanding and changes to the plan 

 

joint venture arrangement on june 19 2008 we entered in to a 5050 joint venture with oprah winfrey and harpo inc “harpo” to rebrand discovery health channel as own oprah winfrey network “own network” it is expected that discovery health will be rebranded as own in late 2009 or early 2010 pursuant to the agreement we have committed to make capital contributions of up to 100 million through september 30 2011 of which 6 million has been funded as of december 31 2008 we anticipate that a significant portion of the 100 million funding obligation will occur in 2009 

 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

 

if we were to experience a significant decline in operating performance or have to meet an unanticipated need for additional liquidity beyond our available commitments there is no certainty that we would be able to access the needed liquidity while we have established relationships with us and international banks and investors which continue to participate in our various credit agreements the current tightening in the credit markets may cause some lenders to have to reduce or withdraw their commitments if we were to seek to negotiate a refinancing or an increase in our total commitments covenants in existing debt agreements may constrain our capacity for additional debt or there may be significant increases in costs to refinance existing debt to access additional liquidity as a public company we may have access to other sources of capital such as the public bond and equity markets however access to sufficient liquidity in these markets is not assured given our substantial debt outstanding and the continued volatility in the equity markets and further tightening in the credit markets 

 

our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside of our control in addition our cost to borrow is impacted by market conditions and our financial performance as measured by certain credit metrics defined in our credit agreements including interest coverage and leverage ratios 

 

contractual obligations 

 

we have agreements covering leases of satellite transponders facilities and equipment these agreements expire at various dates through 2028 we are obligated to license programming under agreements with content suppliers that expire over various dates we also have other contractual commitments arising in the ordinary course of business 

a summary of all of the expected payments for these commitments as well as future principal payments under the current debt arrangements and minimum payments under capital leases at december 31 2008 is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

we are subject to a contractual agreement that may require us to acquire the minority interest of certain of our subsidiaries the amount and timing of such payments are not currently known we have recorded a 49 million liability as of december 31 2008 for this redemption right 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes on an ongoing basis we evaluate estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances the results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions critical accounting policies impact the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates an appreciation of our critical accounting policies facilitates an understanding of our financial results amounts disclosed relate to discovery asadjusted for 2007 and discovery for 2008 unless otherwise noted we applied critical accounting policies and estimates methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented for further information regarding these critical accounting policies and estimates please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue 

 

we derive revenue from i distribution revenue from cable systems satellite operators and other distributors ii advertising aired on our networks and websites and iii other which is largely ecommerce and educational sales 

distribution distributors generally pay a persubscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming under the terms of longterm distribution contracts “distribution revenue” distribution revenue is reported net of incentive costs or other consideration if any offered to system operators in exchange for longterm distribution contracts we recognize distribution revenue over the term of the contracts based on contracted monthly license fee provisions and reported subscriber levels network incentives have historically included upfront cash incentives referred to as “launch support” in connection with the launch of a network by the distributor within certain time frames any such amounts are capitalized as assets upon launch of our programming by the distributor and are amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction of revenue over the terms of the contracts in instances where the distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of the original term we evaluate the economics of the extended term and if it is determined that the deferred launch asset continues to benefit us over the extended term then we will adjust the launch amortization period accordingly other incentives are recognized as a reduction of revenue as incurred 

 

the amount of distribution revenue due to us is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period therefore reported distribution revenue is based upon our estimates of the number of subscribers receiving our programming for the month plus an adjustment for the prior month estimate our subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor 

 

advertising we record advertising revenue net of agency commissions and audience deficiency liabilities in the period advertising spots are broadcast a substantial portion of the advertising sold in the united states includes guaranteed levels of audience that either the program or the advertisement will reach deferred revenue is recorded and adjusted as the guaranteed audience levels are achieved audience guarantees are initially developed by our internal research group and actual audience and delivery information is provided by third party ratings services in certain instances the third party ratings information is not received until after the close of the reporting period in these cases reported advertising revenue and related deferred revenue is based on our estimates for any underdelivery of contracted advertising ratings based on the most current data available from the third party ratings service differences between the estimated underdelivery and the actual underdelivery have historically been insignificant online advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered 

 

certain of our advertising arrangements include deliverables in addition to commercial time such as the advertiser’s product integration into the programming customized vignettes and billboards these contracts that include other deliverables are evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under eitf 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 

 

commerce education and other commerce revenue is recognized upon product shipment net of estimated returns which are not material to our consolidated financial statements educational service sales are generally recognized ratably over the term of the agreement css services revenue is recognized when services are performed revenue from postproduction and certain distribution related services is recognized when services are provided prepayments received for services to be performed at a later date are deferred 

 

derivative financial instruments 

 

statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities “fas 133” requires every derivative instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability the statement also requires that changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met we use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges the effective changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss as interest expense is recorded for debt we use the cumulative dollar offset method to assess effectiveness to be highly effective the ratio calculated by dividing the cumulative change in the value of the actual swap by the cumulative change in the hypothetical swap must be between 80 and 125 the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings we use derivative instruments principally to manage the risk associated 

with the movements of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates that will affect the cash flows of our debt transactions refer to note 12 for additional information regarding derivative instruments held by us and risk management strategies 

 

content rights 

 

costs incurred in the direct production coproduction or licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost fair value or net realizable value in accordance with sop 002 accounting by producers or distributors of films  we amortize our content assets based upon the ratio of current revenue to total estimated revenue “ultimate revenue” to determine this ratio we analyze historical and projected usage for similar programming and apply such usage factors to projected revenue by network adjusted for any future significant programming strategy changes 

 

the result of this policy is an accelerated amortization pattern for the fully distributed us networks segment discovery channel tlc animal planet and discovery channel in the international networks segment over a period of no more than four years the accelerated amortization pattern results in the amortization of approximately 40 to 50 of the program cost during the first year topical or current events programming is amortized over shorter periods based on the nature of the programming and may be expensed upon its initial airing all other networks in the us networks segment and international networks segment utilize up to five year useful life for these networks with programming investment levels lower than the established networks and higher reuse of programming straightline amortization is considered a reasonable estimate of the use of content consistent with the pace of earning ultimate revenue 

 

ultimate revenue assessments include advertising and affiliate revenue streams ancillary revenue is considered immaterial to the assessment changes in management’s assumptions such as changes in expected use could significantly alter our estimates for amortization amortization is approximately 658 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and the unamortized programming balance at december 31 2008 is 12 billion 

 

programming that we expect to alter planned use by reduction or removal from a network because of changes in network strategy is written down to its net realizable value based on adjusted ultimate revenues when identified on a periodic basis management evaluates the net realizable value of content in conjunction with our strategic review of the business changes in management’s assumptions such as changes in expected use could significantly alter our estimates for writeoffs during the third quarter 2008 we implemented significant changes in brand strategies for tlc as a result we recorded a content impairment charge of 17 million which is included as a component of content amortization expense consolidated content impairment including accelerated amortization of certain programs is approximately 39 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

expenses arising from longterm incentive plans 

 

expenses arising from liability awards based on longterm incentive plans are primarily related to our unitbased longterm incentive plan ltip for our employees who meet certain eligibility criteria units were awarded to eligible employees and vest at a rate of 25 per year prior to the newhouse transaction we accounted for the ltip in accordance with fas 133 accounting for derivative financial instruments and eitf 0208 accounting for options granted to employees in unrestricted publicly traded shares of an unrelated entity as the value of units in the ltip was indexed to the value of dhc series a common stock upon redemption of the ltip awards participants received a cash payment based on the difference between the market price of dhc series a common stock on the vesting date and the market price on the date of grant following the newhouse transaction units remained outstanding and were adjusted to track changes in the value of our publicly traded stock we account for these cash settled stock appreciation awards in accordance with fas 123r sharebased payment  

 

the value of units in the ltip is calculated using the blackscholes model each reporting period and the change in unit value of ltip awards outstanding is recorded as compensation expense over the period outstanding we elected to attribute expense for the units in accordance with fas 123r we use volatility of 

dhc common stock or our common stock if available in our blackscholes models however if the term of the units is in excess of the period common stock has been outstanding we use a combination of historical and implied volatility different assumptions could result in different market valuations however the most significant factor in determining the unit value is the price of common stock 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances our 2008 annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed during the fourth quarter did not result in any impairment charges however over the past year the decline in our stock price suggests in a lower estimated fair value for each of our reporting units as a result of this decline the estimated fair value of the uk reporting unit approximates its carrying value accordingly future declines in estimated fair values may result in goodwill impairment charges it is possible that such charges if required could be recorded prior to the fourth quarter of 2009 ie during an interim period if our stock price our results of operations or other factors require such assets to be tested for impairment at an interim date 

 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the first step we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow “dcf” analysis and a marketbased approach determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our budget and longterm business plan in assessing the reasonableness of its determined fair values we evaluate our results against other value indicators such as comparable company public trading values research analyst estimates and values observed in market transactions if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill and nonamortizing trademarks the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination in other words the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

 

the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to amortization are determined using a dcf valuation analysis 

 

longlived assets 

 

longlived assets eg amortizing trademarks customer lists other intangibles and property plant and equipment do not require that an annual impairment test be performed instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale if the intent is to hold the asset for continued use the impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows the asset would be deemed to be impaired impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value fair value is generally determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset if the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other 

criteria are met eg the asset can be disposed of currently appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an active program to locate a buyer the impairment test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its fair value to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 

 

significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value in 2007 there were no significant longlived asset impairments 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded longlived asset impairments of 30 million for hsw and 2 million for exit costs of certain operations 

 

the determination of recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles and longlived assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future cash flows fair values and the appropriate grouping of assets such estimates are subject to change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in the future if different reporting units asset groupings or different valuation methodologies had been used the impairment test results could have differed 

 

deferred launch incentives 

 

consideration issued to cable and satellite distributors in connection with the execution of longterm network distribution agreements is deferred and amortized on a straightline basis as a reduction to revenue over the terms of the agreements obligations for fixed launch incentives are recorded at the inception of the agreement following the renewal of a distribution agreement the remaining deferred consideration is amortized over the extended period amortization of deferred launch incentives was 75 million and 100 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2007 in connection with the settlement of terms under a preexisting distribution agreement we completed negotiations for the renewal of longterm distribution agreements for certain of our uk networks and paid a distributor 196 million most of which is being amortized over a five year period 

 

redeemable interests in subsidiaries 

 

for those instruments with an estimated redemption value redeemable interests in subsidiaries are accreted or amortized to an estimated redemption value ratably over the period to the redemption date accretion and amortization are recorded as a component of minority interest expense 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in instances where we have taken or expect to take a tax position in its tax return and we believe it is more likely than not that such tax position will be upheld by the relevant taxing authority upon settlement we may record the benefits of such tax position in our consolidated financial statements the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the adoption of fin 48 did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 0361 determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities “fsp no eitf 0361” this fsp provides that all outstanding unvested sharebased payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are 

considered participating securities because such awards are considered participating securities the issuing entity is required to apply the twoclass method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share the provisions of fsp no eitf 0361 will be effective for us on january 1 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all priorperiod earnings per share computations the adoption of fsp no eitf 0361 will not have a material impact on our earnings per share amounts 

 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp no 1423 determination of the useful life of intangible assets “fsp 1423” which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset pursuant to fas no 142 the provisions of fsp 1423 will be effective for us on january 1 2009 and will be applied prospectively we are currently evaluating the impact that the provisions of fsp 1423 will have on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements where and when appropriate substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting as a result fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk and can be affected by among other things economic conditions interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations we have established policies procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks we use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

 

the nature and amount of our longterm debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements market conditions and other factors our interest expense is exposed to movements in shortterm interest rates derivative instruments including both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate instruments are used to modify this exposure these instruments include swaps and swaptions to modify interest rate exposure the variable to fixed interest rate instruments had a notional principal amount of 23 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 468 at december 31 2008 for us and december 31 2007 for dch the fixed to variable interest rate agreements had a notional principal amount of 50 million and 225 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 790 and 965 at december 31 2008 for us and december 31 2007 for dch respectively at december 31 2008 we held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of 25 million at a fixed rate of 544 the fair value of these derivative instruments which aggregate 106 million and 50 million at december 31 2008 for us and december 31 2007 for dch respectively is recorded as a component of longterm liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

 

of the total of 29 billion principal amount a notional amount of 2 billion of these derivative instruments are highly effective cash flow hedges the value of these hedges at december 31 2008 was 71 million with changes in the marktomarket value recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss net of taxes should any portion of these instruments become ineffective due to a restructuring in our debt the monthly changes in fair value would be reported as a component of other income on the statement of operations we do not expect material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve months as of december 31 2008 a parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve equal to one percentage point would change the fair value of our interest rate derivative portfolio by approximately 49 million in addition a change of one percentage point in interest rates on variable rate debt would impact interest expense by approximately 6 million on a yearly basis 

 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow accordingly we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments that change in value as foreign exchange rates change the foreign exchange instruments used are spot forward and option contracts additionally we enter into nondesignated forward contracts to hedge nondollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances at december 31 2008 for us and december 31 2007 for dch the notional amount of foreign exchange derivative contracts was 75 million and 174 million respectively the fair value of these derivative instruments is recorded as a component of longterm liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets these derivative instruments did not receive hedge accounting treatment as of december 31 2008 an estimated 10 adverse movement in exchange rates against the us dollar would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by approximately 5 million 

 

we continually monitor our positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments and do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties in addition we limit the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution

 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure tableend  

prior to the completion of the merger of dhc with a whollyowned subsidiary of discovery on september 17 2008 kpmg llp “kpmg” was dhc’s independent registered public accounting firm as the transaction was treated as a nonsubstantive merger for accounting purposes dhc is considered our predecessor registrant in connection with the merger we made the decision to change our independent registered public accounting firm to pricewaterhousecoopers llp and dismissed kpmg as our independent registered public accounting firm as of september 18 2008 this change was approved by our audit committee 

 

during dhc’s two most recent fiscal years and through the date of dismissal of kpmg there were no disagreements with kpmg on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of kpmg would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report there were no reportable events under item 304alv of regulation sk that occurred during the fiscal years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 and through september 18 2008

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

the company’s management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

no changes were made to the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

as a result of the newhouse transaction as of september 18 2008 the company’s internal control over financial reporting largely consists of dch’s controls instead of dhc’s 

 

prior to the transaction dhc accounted for dch as an equity investment accordingly dhc’s annual management assessment of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act did not cover dch’s internal controls due to the consummation of the newhouse transaction late in the fiscal year dhc and dch submitted a request to the staff of the sec for concurrence that the company would not be required to complete an assessment of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 for the year ended december 31 2008 the company has been advised by the staff of the sec that it has no objection to this request 

 

as of december 31 2009 the company is required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 in the interim the company will be required to perform the documentation evaluation and testing required to make these assessments
