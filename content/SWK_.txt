business and operational risks 

the continued adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period could have a materially negative impact on the company’s business operations financial condition results of operations and liquidity the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread public health crisis and governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of the virus these measures have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s workforce and operations and the operations of its customers distributors suppliers and contractors there is significant uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on the companys access to its manufacturing facilities or on its support operations or workforce or similar limitations for its distributors and suppliers these measures have limited and could continue to limit customer demand andor the companys capacity to meet customer demand which could have a material negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations in addition a sustained downturn in customer demand or other economic conditions could result in material charges related to bad debt or inventory writeoffs restructuring charges or impairments of longlived assets including both tangible and intangible assets furthermore a sustained downturn in financial markets and asset values could adversely affect the company’s cost of capital liquidity and access to capital markets in addition to potentially increasing its pension funding obligations to ensure its pension plans continue to be adequately funded 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused the company to modify its business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the company determines are in the best interests of its employees customers distributors suppliers and contractors there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and the companys ability to perform critical functions could be harmed furthermore as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the company executed certain temporary and permanent cost reduction measures including adjustments to its supply chain and manufacturing labor base to match the demand environment and reductions in staffing compensation and benefits in a manner that allows the company to respond to changes in demand these cost reduction measures may not prove to be successful and the company may need to undertake further measures that could adversely impact its business andor its ability to ramp up operations in a timely manner 

the continued spread of covid19 has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the companys supply chain cause delay or limit the ability of customers to continue to operate and perform including in making timely payments to the company result in the companys inability to meet its consumers and customers needs due to disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements and cause other unpredictable events 

in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic may also limit the company’s resources or delay the company’s ability to implement strategic initiatives if strategic initiatives are delayed such initiatives may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s competitive position business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

the continued spread of covid19 has caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for certain of the company’s products as lockdowns occurred in the first and second quarters of 2020 those subject to lockdowns engaged in home improvement projects in large numbers and demand for the company’s products at its retail partners increased significantly as different geographical areas anticipate moving into a recovery era demand for the company’s products may decrease as focus shifts to activities outside the home the degree to which covid19 ultimately affects the company’s results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact the availability distribution acceptance and efficacy of a vaccine and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers in 2020 the two largest customers comprised approximately 27 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 42 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on the companys net sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

operations excellence one element of the sbd operating model is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the operations excellence principles to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences evolving industry standards or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the pace of technological change continues to accelerate and the companys ability to react effectively to such change may present significant competitive risks 

the pace of technological change is increasing at an exponential rate the continued creation development and advancement of new technologies such as 5g data networks artificial intelligence blockchain quantum computing data analytics 3d printing robotics sensor technology data storage neural networks augmented reality amongst others as well as other technologies in the future that are not foreseen today continue to transform the company’s processes products and services 

in order to remain competitive the company will need to stay abreast of such technologies require its employees to continue to learn and adapt to new technologies and be able to integrate them into its current and future business models products services and processes and also guard against existing and new competitors disrupting its business using such technologies the company’s strategy value creation model operating model and innovation ecosystem have important technological elements and many of the company’s products and offerings are based on technological advances including artificial intelligence machine learning advanced analytics and the internet of things in addition the company will need to compete for talent that is familiar with such technologies including upskilling its workforce there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes which could result in a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political legal economic and other risks arising from operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and protecting assets through legal systems outside the us including intellectual property rights which may not be recognized and which the company may not be able to protect outside the us to the same extent as under us law 

• managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery anticorruption and sanctions regulations 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements including those related to the uss relationship with china 

• the application of certain labor regulations outside of the united states 

• compliance with a wide variety of nonus laws and regulations 

• ongoing stability or changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where the company operates particularly in emerging markets 

• the threat of nationalization and expropriation 

• increased costs and risks of doing business and managing a workforce in a wide variety of jurisdictions 

• the increased possibility of cyber threats in certain jurisdictions 

• government controls limiting importation of goods 

• government controls limiting payments to suppliers for imported goods 

• limitations on or impacts from the repatriation of foreign earnings and 

• exposure to wage price and capital controls 

changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally the company is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws or sanctions regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from including importation into the us of the companys products manufactured overseas may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions in recent years changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements have negatively impacted the company’s business for example in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that the company may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact the company’s results of operations furthermore imported products and materials may be subject to future tariffs or other trade measures in the us imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or failure by the company’s suppliers to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union eu or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as fluctuations in freight costs port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather due to climate change or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

in addition the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to 

achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions with catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure or other costs associated with information technology system implementations or cyber security risks 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations factors that are hard to predict or are beyond the company’s control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions acts or threats of war or terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches sabotage generalized labor unrest or public health crises including pandemics could damage or disrupt the company’s infrastructure or that of its suppliers or distributors if the company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations or cannot quickly repair damage to its information production or supply systems the company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected if a material or extended disruption occurs the company may lose its customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to its reputation and longterm consumer demand for its products and services could decline although the company maintains business interruption insurance it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions these events could materially and adversely affect the company’s product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the company relies heavily on digital technology including those of third parties to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions digital technologies are important to sales and marketing production planning manufacturing customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the companys various businesses in many countries additionally the company relies on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors and the companys business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such thirdparty systems 

in addition the company is in the process of system integrations conversions and capability additions such as ecommerce artificial intelligence and data analytics to drive enhanced business outcomes there can be no assurances that expected expense or revenue synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of system integrations conversions or capability additions it is possible the costs to complete the system integrations conversions or capability additions may exceed expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations and overall business is increased when complex system changes such as integrations conversions or additions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s digital technology could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

despite efforts to prevent such situations and maintaining insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s digital technologies may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or cyber attacks 

industry and economic risks 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

in addition many of the company’s products incorporate battery technology as other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products or increase their current consumption of battery technology the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the company’s supply chain in addition increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials if the company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints related increased costs or drive alternative technology through innovation its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 39 of its revenues outside the us including 19 from europe and 11 from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales in these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

• depressed consumer and business confidence may decrease demand for products and services 

• customers may implement cost reduction initiatives or delay purchases to address inventory levels 

• significant declines of foreign currency values in countries where the company operates could impact both the revenue growth and overall profitability in those geographies 

• a slowing or contracting chinese economy could reduce china’s consumption and negatively impact the company’s sales in that region as well as globally 

• a devaluation of foreign currencies could have an effect on the credit worthiness as well as the availability of funds of customers in those regions impacting the collectability of receivables 

• a devaluation of foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the value of financial assets of the company in the effected countries and 

• the impact of an event individual country default brexit or break up of the euro could have an adverse impact on the global credit markets and global liquidity potentially impacting the company’s ability to access these credit markets and to raise capital 

continuing uncertainty associated with brexit could adversely affect the company’s business 

while the uk parliament has voted to approve the withdrawaltransition agreement negotiated by the eu and the uk government and while in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that will apply provisionally after the end of the transition period significant uncertainty remains with respect to the impacts of brexit brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets any impact from brexit on the companys business and operations over the long term will depend in part on the outcome of the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement future agreements or lack thereof between the uk and the eu including with respect to tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other negotiations 

in particular the companys operations in the uk will be particularly exposed to the risks and uncertainties relating to brexit under the trade and cooperation agreement uk service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire eu single market uk goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free movement of people between the uk and the eu the bank of england and other observers have warned of a significant probability of a brexitrelated recession in the uk volatility in exchanges rates including potential declines in the value of the british pound 

and in interest rates are also expected disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on the companys products and services these impacts could cause a significant decline in revenue as the company generates approximately 4 of its revenues in the uk in addition as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate including uk competition laws brexit could lead to potentially divergent national laws and regulations lack of clarity about the future relationship between the uk and the eu and the laws and regulations that may apply including in particular with respect to aspects of laws and regulations which were not covered by the trade and cooperation agreement such as financial laws and regulations could increase costs and depress economic activity any of the foregoing factors could result in an uncertain and difficult regulatory environment that could negatively impact the company’s uk business 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

financing risks 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness and may in the future issue additional equity securities including in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8  the company has a fiveyear 20 billion committed credit facility and a 364day 10 billion committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities at january 2 2021 as of january 2 2021 the company had 43 billion principal amount of indebtedness 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

• a limitation on creating liens on certain property of the company and its subsidiaries 

• a restriction on entering into certain saleleaseback transactions 

• customary events of default if an event of default occurs and is continuing the company might be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or agreement and 

• maintenance of a specified financial ratio the company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its committed revolving credit facilities the interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to adjusted interest expense adjusted ebitdaadjusted interest expense such adjustments to interest or ebitda include but are not limited to removal of noncash interest expense and stockbased compensation expense in april 2020 the company entered into an amendment to a amend the definition of adjusted ebitda to allow for additional adjustment addbacks which primarily relate to anticipated incremental charges related to the covid19 pandemic for amounts incurred beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021 and b lower the minimum interest coverage ratio from 35 to 25 times for the period from and including the second quarter of 2020 through the end of fiscal year 2021 the interest coverage ratio must not be less than 25 times and is computed 

quarterly on a rolling twelve months last twelve months basis under this covenant definition the interest coverage ratio was 84 times ebitda or higher in each of the 2020 quarterly measurement periods management does not believe it is reasonably likely the company will breach this covenant failure to maintain this ratio could adversely affect further access to liquidity 

future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and acquisition strategy 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the company may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions 

furthermore there could be a number of followon effects from a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as its access to the capital markets 

discontinuation reform or replacement of the london interbank offered rate libor and other benchmark rates or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing may adversely affect the company 

a portion of the company’s indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain shortterm prevailing interest rates including the libor the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates these may be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate or other benchmark rates over the next several years the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets these changes and related uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing at this time the company cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of libor or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has approximately 100 billion of goodwill approximately 22 billion of indefinitelived trade names and approximately 19 billion of net definitelived intangible assets 

at january 2 2021 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2020 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of approximately 40 million and expects to contribute 41 million to its defined benefit plans in 2021 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at january 2 2021 was approximately 24 billion 

strategic risks 

the successful execution of the company’s business strategy depends on its ability to recruit retain train motivate and develop employees and execute effective succession planning 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and management personnel its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain train and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth in addition the company must invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling its employees including placing an emphasis on lifelong learning 

a shortage of key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy and changes in the key management team can result in loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge departure of other key employees disruptions to the company’s operations and inefficiency during transitional periods the company’s reputation business revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to recruit retain train motivate and develop employees and successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2020 the company completed the consolidated aerospace manufacturing llc “cam” acquisition as well as smaller acquisitions and may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

• the failure to identify the most suitable candidates for acquisitions 

• the difficulties and cost in obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals 

• the ability to identify and close on appropriate acquisition opportunities within desired time frames at reasonable cost 

• the anticipated additional revenues from the acquired companies do not materialize despite extensive due diligence 

• the possibility that the acquired companies will not be successfully integrated or that anticipated cost savings synergies or other benefits will not be realized 

• the acquired businesses will lose market acceptance or profitability 

• the diversion of company management’s attention and other resources 

• the incurrence of unexpected costs and liabilities including those associated with undisclosed preclosing regulatory violations by the acquired business and 

• the loss of key personnel clients or customers of acquired companies 

in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and acquisition strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

• combine businesses and operations 

• integrate departments systems and procedures and 

• obtain cost savings and other efficiencies from such reorganizations including the companys margin resiliency initiative 

failure to effectively integrate acquired companies consummate or manage any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation andor adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the company’s activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the company’s growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

legal tax regulatory and compliance risks 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation any inability to protect the companys other intellectual property rights could also reduce the value of its products and services or diminish its competitiveness 

the company considers its intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and licenses held to be a significant part and valuable aspect of its business the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements 

the company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the companys success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

in addition the companys ability to compete could be negatively impacted by its failure to obtain and adequately protect its intellectual property and preserve its associated intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trade secrets and licenses as well as its products and any new features of its products or processes the companys patent applications may not be approved and any patents owned could be challenged invalidated or designed around by third parties in addition the companys patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the company’s computer systems and networks certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its thirdparty vendors cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out direct largescale complex automated attacks against a company or through vendor software supply chain compromises in particular the company is increasingly relying on its it infrastructure to support its operations as it manages the impact of covid19 including supporting remotework protocols for a substantial number of the company’s employees in regions impacted by the spread of covid19 which can increase cyber risks the company is not able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting material security breach or data loss in addition it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or thirdparty vendors 

breaches of the company’s technology systems or those of the company’s vendors whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering vendor software supply chain compromises physical breaches or other actions have and may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ websites applications data processing and certain products and services or disruption of other business operations furthermore any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about the company’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft breaches of the company’s products that rely on technology and internet connectivity can expose the company to product and other liability risk and reputational harm measures that the company takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents including implementing and conducting training on insider trading policies for the company’s employees and maintaining contractual obligations for the company’s thirdparty vendors can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training organizational investments incident response plans table top exercises and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems products and services or those of the company’s third parties could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company the report rumor or assumption regarding a potential breach may have similar results even if no breach has been attempted or occurred any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws 

to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to the company is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches similarly the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” came into effect in january 2020 provides among other things a new private right of action for data breaches requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and provides consumers with additional rights the california privacy rights and enforcement act which will become effective on january 1 2023 amends and expands the ccpa creating new industry requirements consumer privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms the companys reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the company fails or is perceived to have 

failed to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders in many cases these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the company and its subsidiaries 

all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time privacy laws that may be implemented in the future including the schrems ii decision invalidating the eu  us privacy shield will continue to require changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs or may result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and may subject the company to remedies that may harm its business including fines or demands or orders that the company modify or cease existing business practices 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states lastly it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision cash tax liability and effective tax rate beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation arrangements between the company and its distributors franchisees or vendors intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company has been and could be in the future subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation the failure of the company’s products systems and services to be properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered resulting in personal injuries property damage or business interruption could subject the company to claims for damages the company has and is currently defending product liability claims some of which have resulted in settlements or monetary judgments against the company the costs associated with defending ongoing or future product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the company maintains an awareness of and responsibility for the potential health and safety impacts on its customers the companys product development processes include tollgates for product safety review and extensive testing is conducted on product safety safety reviews are performed at various product development milestones including a review of product labeling and marking to ensure safety and operational hazards are identified for the customer 

despite safety and quality reviews the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require or the company may voluntarily institute the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase the companys costs and adversely impact its reputation 

the company’s sales to government customers exposes it to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations procurement regulations governmental policy shifts early termination of contracts audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

the company derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and foreign governments government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements these requirements although customary in government contracts could impact the company’s performance and compliance costs including limiting or delaying the company’s ability to share information with its business partners customers and investors which may negatively impact the company’s business and reputation 

the us government may demand contract terms that are less favorable than standard arrangements with private sector customers and may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with the company for example the us government may have contract clauses that permit it to terminate any of the company’s government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience and procurement regulations permit termination for default based on the company’s performance in addition changes in us government budgetary priorities could lead to changes in the procurement environment affecting availability of government contracting or funding opportunities changes in government procurement policy priorities regulations technology initiatives and requirements andor contract award criteria may negatively impact the company’s potential for growth in the government sector changes in government cybersecurity and system requirements could negatively impact the company’s eligibility for the award of future contracts negatively impacting the company’s business and reputation 

government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks and contracts are generally subject to audits investigations and approval of policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable law if violations of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business each of these factors could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 

  

a future payments on longterm debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities excluding certain fair value adjustments included in longterm debt as discussed further in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements 

b future interest payments on longterm debt reflect the applicable interest rate in effect at january 2 2021  

c inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials components and sourced products 

d future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value and accrued interest as of january 2 2021 the ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ perhaps significantly based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impacts of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2020 would have been an incremental pretax loss of approximately 43 million based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 157 million or approximately 081 per diluted share in 2020 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 73 million or approximately 038 per diluted share 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its commercial paper program in which the pricing is partially based on shortterm us interest rates at january 2 2021 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan esop section of mda additionally the company has 120 million of liabilities as of january 2 2021 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2020 2019 and 2018 investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a 280 million increase a 323 million increase and a 72 million decrease respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 41 million in 2021 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no inst ruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements solely due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ability to access equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan esop — as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans have been funded overall esop expense was affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares were released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 63 million in 2020 income of 05 million in 2019 and expense of 04 million in 2018 us defined contribution retirement plan expense will increase in the future as all remaining unallocated shares were released in the first quarter of 2020 

critical accounting estimates — preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for credit losses — the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables the allowance is determined using two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection rates writeoff experience and forecasts of future economic conditions 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company or adverse changes in forecasts of future economic conditions then the companys estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories — inventories in the us are primarily valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are primarily valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost and net realizable value the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its 

inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market or net realizable value as applicable cost is used for inventory valuation if market value or net realizable value as applicable is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 35020 goodwill  acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses at january 2 2021 the company reported 10038 billion of goodwill 2198 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 1858 billion of net definitelived intangibles 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its estimated fair value an impairment charge would be recorded for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2020 in accordance with accounting standards update asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test impairment tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units for its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2020 the company applied a quantitative test for all of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model based on the results of this testing it was determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its respective carrying amount by in excess of 40 with the exception of the infrastructure reporting unit as discussed below 

as previously disclosed in the companys form 10q for the third quarter of 2020 the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 16 in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january 2 2021 the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit which included approximately 585 million of goodwill at yearend the key assumptions applied to the updated cash flow projections for the infrastructure reporting unit included a 95 discount rate nearterm revenue growth rates over the next six years which represented a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4 and a 3 perpetual growth rate based on this analysis it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 23 the increase in excess fair value is reflective of an improved nearterm outlook based on results and trends in the fourth quarter of 2020 management remains confident in the longterm viability and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on its leading market position in its respective industries and the companys continued commitment to and investments in organic growth and margin resiliency initiatives 

for the company’s remaining reporting units the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 75 to 95 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next six years which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 3 to 5 and perpetual growth rates of 3 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models for these reporting units utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

the company also tested its indefinitelived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2020 utilizing a discounted cash flow model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales with the exception of an immaterial trade name the company determined that the fair values of its indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units or indefinitelived trade names do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existi ng at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at january 2 2021 for the united states and international pension plans were 239 and 131 respectively the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 28 2019 for the united states and international pension plans were 320 and 180 respectively as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 525 and 390 respectively at january 2 2021 the company will use a 316 w eightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2021 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2021 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 6 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 667 million at january 2 2021 a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 108 million at january 2 2021 the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized approximately 19 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2020 which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of january 2 2021 the company had reserves of 174 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 103 million to 245 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making this determination management considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing temporary differences estimates of future taxable income taxplanning strategies and the realizability of net operating 

loss carryforwards in the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made conversely if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made 

the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 which requires a twostep process first management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority the company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the companys tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months these changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits litigation or other proceedings with taxing authorities the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty

a material weakness as defined in rule 12b2 under the exchange act is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis

1 the design of its control to consider all the relevant authoritative accounting guidance for financial instruments with debt and equitylike features and 

2 the design of its control to consider financial instruments with debt and equitylike features in the calculation of earnings per share 

the company assessed whether there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of the above control deficiencies the first control deficiency could result in a determination that there are two units of account in which the forward stock purchase contracts when evaluated separately as freestanding instruments would be precluded from equity classification as a result the asset or liability related to the forward stock purchase contracts would be subject to marktomarket accounting which would be significantly influenced by factors outside of the company’s control including fluctuations in its share price the second control deficiency resulted in material errors in the calculation of diluted earnings per share previously disclosed in the company’s historical financial statements based on these factors the company concluded that the deficiencies noted above each rise to the level of a material weakness 

remediation of material weaknesses 

the company acknowledges that its management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and assessing the effectiveness of its internal controls the company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures to ensure that the control deficiencies identified above are remediated as soon as possible management is in the process of implementing its remediation plan which includes steps to design and implement new controls and expand education and training related to the accounting considerations for complex financing transactions the company will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that the controls are operating effectively

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in item 7 and in other documents that the company files with the sec before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

business and operational risks 

the continued adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period could have a materially negative impact on the company’s business operations financial condition results of operations and liquidity the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread public health crisis and governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of the virus these measures have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s workforce and operations and the operations of its customers distributors suppliers and contractors there is significant uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures and restrictions on the companys access to its manufacturing facilities or on its support operations or workforce or similar limitations for its distributors and suppliers these measures have limited and could continue to limit customer demand andor the companys capacity to meet customer demand which could have a material negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations in addition a sustained downturn in customer demand or other economic conditions could result in material charges related to bad debt or inventory writeoffs restructuring charges or impairments of longlived assets including both tangible and intangible assets furthermore a sustained downturn in financial markets and asset values could adversely affect the company’s cost of capital liquidity and access to capital markets in addition to potentially increasing its pension funding obligations to ensure its pension plans continue to be adequately funded 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused the company to modify its business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the company determines are in the best interests 

of its employees customers distributors suppliers and contractors there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and the companys ability to perform critical functions could be harmed furthermore as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic the company executed certain temporary and permanent cost reduction measures including adjustments to its supply chain and manufacturing labor base to match the demand environment and reductions in staffing compensation and benefits in a manner that allows the company to respond to changes in demand these cost reduction measures may not prove to be successful and the company may need to undertake further measures that could adversely impact its business andor its ability to ramp up operations in a timely manner 

the continued spread of covid19 has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the companys supply chain cause delay or limit the ability of customers to continue to operate and perform including in making timely payments to the company result in the companys inability to meet its consumers and customers needs due to disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements and cause other unpredictable events 

in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic may also limit the company’s resources or delay the company’s ability to implement strategic initiatives if strategic initiatives are delayed such initiatives may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s competitive position business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

the continued spread of covid19 has caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for certain of the company’s products as lockdowns occurred in the first and second quarters of 2020 those subject to lockdowns engaged in home improvement projects in large numbers and demand for the company’s products at its retail partners increased significantly as different geographical areas anticipate moving into a recovery era demand for the company’s products may decrease as focus shifts to activities outside the home the degree to which covid19 ultimately affects the company’s results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact the availability distribution acceptance and efficacy of a vaccine and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers in 2020 the two largest customers comprised approximately 27 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 42 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on the companys net sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and 

services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

operations excellence one element of the sbd operating model is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the operations excellence principles to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences evolving industry standards or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the pace of technological change continues to accelerate and the companys ability to react effectively to such change may present significant competitive risks 

the pace of technological change is increasing at an exponential rate the continued creation development and advancement of new technologies such as 5g data networks artificial intelligence blockchain quantum computing data analytics 3d printing robotics sensor technology data storage neural networks augmented reality amongst others as well as other technologies in the future that are not foreseen today continue to transform the company’s processes products and services 

in order to remain competitive the company will need to stay abreast of such technologies require its employees to continue to learn and adapt to new technologies and be able to integrate them into its current and future business models products services and processes and also guard against existing and new competitors disrupting its business using such technologies the company’s strategy value creation model operating model and innovation ecosystem have important technological elements and many of the company’s products and offerings are based on technological advances including artificial intelligence 

machine learning advanced analytics and the internet of things in addition the company will need to compete for talent that is familiar with such technologies including upskilling its workforce there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes which could result in a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political legal economic and other risks arising from operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and protecting assets through legal systems outside the us including intellectual property rights which may not be recognized and which the company may not be able to protect outside the us to the same extent as under us law 

• managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery anticorruption and sanctions regulations 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements including those related to the uss relationship with china 

• the application of certain labor regulations outside of the united states 

• compliance with a wide variety of nonus laws and regulations 

• ongoing stability or changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where the company operates particularly in emerging markets 

• the threat of nationalization and expropriation 

• increased costs and risks of doing business and managing a workforce in a wide variety of jurisdictions 

• the increased possibility of cyber threats in certain jurisdictions 

• government controls limiting importation of goods 

• government controls limiting payments to suppliers for imported goods 

• limitations on or impacts from the repatriation of foreign earnings and 

• exposure to wage price and capital controls 

changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally the company is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws or sanctions regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from including importation into the us of the companys products manufactured overseas may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions in recent years changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements have negatively impacted the company’s business for example in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that the company may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact the company’s results of operations furthermore imported products and materials may be subject to future tariffs or other trade measures in the us imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s 

cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or failure by the company’s suppliers to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union eu or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as fluctuations in freight costs port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather due to climate change or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

in addition the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s business and financial results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions with catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure or other costs associated with information technology system implementations or cyber security risks 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations factors that are hard to predict or are beyond the company’s control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions acts or threats of war or terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches sabotage generalized labor unrest or public health crises including pandemics could damage or disrupt the company’s infrastructure or that of its suppliers or distributors if the company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations or cannot quickly repair damage to its information production or supply systems the company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected if a material or extended disruption occurs the company may lose its customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to its reputation and longterm consumer demand for its products and services could decline although the company maintains business interruption insurance it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions these events could materially and adversely affect the company’s product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the company relies heavily on digital technology including those of third parties to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions digital technologies are important to sales and marketing production planning manufacturing customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the companys various businesses in many countries additionally the company relies on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors and the companys business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such thirdparty systems 

in addition the company is in the process of system integrations conversions and capability additions such as ecommerce artificial intelligence and data analytics to drive enhanced business outcomes there can be no assurances that expected expense or revenue synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of system integrations conversions or capability additions it is possible the costs to complete the system integrations conversions or capability additions may exceed expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations and overall business is increased when complex system changes such as integrations conversions or additions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s digital technology could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

despite efforts to prevent such situations and maintaining insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s digital technologies may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or cyber attacks 

industry and economic risks 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

in addition many of the company’s products incorporate battery technology as other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products or increase their current consumption of battery technology the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the company’s supply chain in addition increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials if the company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints related increased costs or drive alternative technology through innovation its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 39 of its revenues outside the us including 19 from europe and 11 from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales in these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

• depressed consumer and business confidence may decrease demand for products and services 

• customers may implement cost reduction initiatives or delay purchases to address inventory levels 

• significant declines of foreign currency values in countries where the company operates could impact both the revenue growth and overall profitability in those geographies 

• a slowing or contracting chinese economy could reduce china’s consumption and negatively impact the company’s sales in that region as well as globally 

• a devaluation of foreign currencies could have an effect on the credit worthiness as well as the availability of funds of customers in those regions impacting the collectability of receivables 

• a devaluation of foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the value of financial assets of the company in the effected countries and 

• the impact of an event individual country default brexit or break up of the euro could have an adverse impact on the global credit markets and global liquidity potentially impacting the company’s ability to access these credit markets and to raise capital 

continuing uncertainty associated with brexit could adversely affect the company’s business 

while the uk parliament has voted to approve the withdrawaltransition agreement negotiated by the eu and the uk government and while in december 2020 the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that will apply provisionally after the end of the transition period significant uncertainty remains with respect to the impacts of brexit brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets any impact from brexit on the companys business and operations over the long term will depend in part on the outcome of the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement future agreements or lack thereof between the uk and the eu including with respect to tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other negotiations 

in particular the companys operations in the uk will be particularly exposed to the risks and uncertainties relating to brexit under the trade and cooperation agreement uk service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire eu single market uk goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free movement of people between the uk and the eu the bank of england and other observers have warned of a significant probability of a brexitrelated recession in the uk volatility in exchanges rates including potential declines in the value of the british pound and in interest rates are also expected disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on the companys products and services these impacts could cause a significant decline in revenue as the company generates approximately 4 of its revenues in the uk in addition as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate including uk competition laws brexit could lead to potentially divergent national laws and regulations lack of clarity about the future relationship between the uk and the eu and the laws and regulations that may apply including in particular with respect to aspects of laws and regulations which were not covered by the trade and cooperation agreement such as financial laws and regulations could increase costs and depress economic activity any of the foregoing factors could result in an uncertain and difficult regulatory environment that could negatively impact the company’s uk business 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

financing risks 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness and may in the future issue additional equity securities including in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8  the company has a fiveyear 20 billion committed credit facility and a 364day 10 billion committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities at january 2 2021 as of january 2 2021 the company had 43 billion principal amount of indebtedness 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

• a limitation on creating liens on certain property of the company and its subsidiaries 

• a restriction on entering into certain saleleaseback transactions 

• customary events of default if an event of default occurs and is continuing the company might be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or agreement and 

• maintenance of a specified financial ratio the company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its committed revolving credit facilities the interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to adjusted interest expense adjusted ebitdaadjusted interest expense such adjustments to interest or ebitda include but are not limited to removal of noncash interest expense and stockbased compensation expense in april 2020 the company entered into an amendment to a amend the definition of adjusted ebitda to allow for additional adjustment addbacks which primarily relate to anticipated incremental charges related to the covid19 pandemic for amounts incurred beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021 and b lower the minimum interest coverage ratio from 35 to 25 times for the period from and including the second quarter of 2020 through the end of fiscal year 2021 the interest coverage ratio must not be less than 25 times and is computed quarterly on a rolling twelve months last twelve months basis under this covenant definition the interest coverage ratio was 84 times ebitda or higher in each of the 2020 quarterly measurement periods management does not believe it is reasonably likely the company will breach this covenant failure to maintain this ratio could adversely affect further access to liquidity 

future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and acquisition strategy 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the company may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions 

furthermore there could be a number of followon effects from a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current 

market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as its access to the capital markets 

discontinuation reform or replacement of the london interbank offered rate libor and other benchmark rates or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing may adversely affect the company 

a portion of the company’s indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain shortterm prevailing interest rates including the libor the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates these may be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate or other benchmark rates over the next several years the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets these changes and related uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing at this time the company cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of libor or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has approximately 100 billion of goodwill approximately 22 billion of indefinitelived trade names and approximately 19 billion of net definitelived intangible assets at january 2 2021 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2020 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of approximately 40 million and expects to contribute 41 million to its defined benefit plans in 2021 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at january 2 2021 was approximately 24 billion 

strategic risks 

the successful execution of the company’s business strategy depends on its ability to recruit retain train motivate and develop employees and execute effective succession planning 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and management personnel its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made 

in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain train and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth in addition the company must invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling its employees including placing an emphasis on lifelong learning 

a shortage of key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy and changes in the key management team can result in loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge departure of other key employees disruptions to the company’s operations and inefficiency during transitional periods the company’s reputation business revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to recruit retain train motivate and develop employees and successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2020 the company completed the consolidated aerospace manufacturing llc “cam” acquisition as well as smaller acquisitions and may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

• the failure to identify the most suitable candidates for acquisitions 

• the difficulties and cost in obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals 

• the ability to identify and close on appropriate acquisition opportunities within desired time frames at reasonable cost 

• the anticipated additional revenues from the acquired companies do not materialize despite extensive due diligence 

• the possibility that the acquired companies will not be successfully integrated or that anticipated cost savings synergies or other benefits will not be realized 

• the acquired businesses will lose market acceptance or profitability 

• the diversion of company management’s attention and other resources 

• the incurrence of unexpected costs and liabilities including those associated with undisclosed preclosing regulatory violations by the acquired business and 

• the loss of key personnel clients or customers of acquired companies 

in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and acquisition strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

• combine businesses and operations 

• integrate departments systems and procedures and 

• obtain cost savings and other efficiencies from such reorganizations including the companys margin resiliency initiative 

failure to effectively integrate acquired companies consummate or manage any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation andor adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the company’s activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the company’s growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

legal tax regulatory and compliance risks 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation any inability to protect the companys other intellectual property rights could also reduce the value of its products and services or diminish its competitiveness 

the company considers its intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and licenses held to be a significant part and valuable aspect of its business the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements 

the company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the companys success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

in addition the companys ability to compete could be negatively impacted by its failure to obtain and adequately protect its intellectual property and preserve its associated intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trade secrets and licenses as well as its products and any new features of its products or processes the companys patent applications may not be approved and any patents owned could be challenged invalidated or designed around by third parties in addition the companys patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the company’s computer systems and networks certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its thirdparty vendors cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out direct largescale complex automated attacks against a company or through vendor software supply chain compromises in particular the company is increasingly relying on its it infrastructure to support its operations as it manages the impact of covid19 including supporting remotework protocols for a substantial number of the company’s employees in regions impacted by the spread of covid19 which can increase cyber risks the company is not able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting material security breach or data loss in addition it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or thirdparty vendors 

breaches of the company’s technology systems or those of the company’s vendors whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering vendor software supply chain compromises physical breaches or other actions have and may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ websites applications data processing and certain products and services or disruption of other business operations furthermore any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about the company’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft breaches of the company’s products that rely on technology and internet connectivity can expose the company to product and other liability risk and reputational harm measures that the company takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents including implementing and conducting training on insider trading policies for the company’s employees and maintaining contractual obligations for the company’s thirdparty vendors can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training organizational investments incident response plans table top exercises and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated 

global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems products and services or those of the company’s third parties could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company the report rumor or assumption regarding a potential breach may have similar results even if no breach has been attempted or occurred any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws 

to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to the company is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches similarly the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” came into effect in january 2020 provides among other things a new private right of action for data breaches requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and provides consumers with additional rights the california privacy rights and enforcement act which will become effective on january 1 2023 amends and expands the ccpa creating new industry requirements consumer privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms the companys reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the company fails or is perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders in many cases these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the company and its subsidiaries 

all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time privacy laws that may be implemented in the future including the schrems ii decision invalidating the eu  us privacy shield will continue to require changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs or may result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and may subject the company to remedies that may harm its business including fines or demands or orders that the company modify or cease existing business practices 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states lastly it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision cash tax liability and effective tax rate beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation arrangements between the company and its distributors franchisees or vendors intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company has been and could be in the future subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation the failure of the company’s products systems and services to be properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered resulting in personal injuries property damage or business interruption could subject the company to claims for damages the company has and is currently defending product liability claims some of which have resulted in settlements or monetary judgments against the company the costs associated with defending ongoing or future product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the company maintains an awareness of and responsibility for the potential health and safety impacts on its customers the companys product development processes include tollgates for product safety review and extensive testing is conducted on product safety safety reviews are performed at various product development milestones including a review of product labeling and marking to ensure safety and operational hazards are identified for the customer 

despite safety and quality reviews the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require or the company may voluntarily institute the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase the companys costs and adversely impact its reputation 

the company’s sales to government customers exposes it to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations procurement regulations governmental policy shifts early termination of contracts audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

the company derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and foreign governments government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements these requirements although customary in government contracts could impact the company’s performance and compliance costs including limiting or delaying the company’s ability to share information with its business partners customers and investors which may negatively impact the company’s business and reputation 

the us government may demand contract terms that are less favorable than standard arrangements with private sector customers and may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with the company for example the us government may have contract clauses that permit it to terminate any of the company’s government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience and procurement regulations permit termination for default based on the company’s performance in addition changes in us government budgetary priorities could lead to changes in the procurement environment affecting availability of government contracting or funding opportunities changes in government procurement policy priorities regulations technology initiatives and requirements andor contract award criteria may negatively impact the company’s potential for growth in the government sector changes in government cybersecurity and system requirements could 

negatively impact the company’s eligibility for the award of future contracts negatively impacting the company’s business and reputation 

government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks and contracts are generally subject to audits investigations and approval of policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable law if violations of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business each of these factors could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation 

other risks

the company’s results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations the company may provide public guidance on expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in the company’s other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions the company makes at the time it provides such guidance the company’s guidance may not always be accurate the company may also choose to withdraw guidance as it did in response to the uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic if in the future the company’s results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts the company reduces its guidance for future periods or the company withdraws guidance the market price of the company’s common stock could decline significantly

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impacts of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2020 would have been an incremental pretax loss of approximately 43 million based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 157 million or approximately 085 per diluted share in 2020 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 73 million or approximately 040 per diluted share 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its commercial paper program in which the pricing is partially based on shortterm us interest rates at january 2 2021 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan esop section of mda additionally the company has 120 million of liabilities as of january 2 2021 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2020 2019 and 2018 investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a 280 million increase a 323 million increase and a 72 million decrease respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 41 million in 2021 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no inst ruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements solely due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ability to access equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan esop — as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans have been funded overall esop expense was affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares were released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 63 million in 2020 income of 05 million in 2019 and expense of 04 million in 2018 us defined contribution retirement plan expense will increase in the future as all remaining unallocated shares were released in the first quarter of 2020 

critical accounting estimates — preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for credit losses — the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables the allowance is determined using two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection rates writeoff experience and forecasts of future economic conditions 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company or adverse changes in forecasts of future economic conditions then the companys estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories — inventories in the us are primarily valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are primarily valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost and net realizable value the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its 

inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market or net realizable value as applicable cost is used for inventory valuation if market value or net realizable value as applicable is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 35020 goodwill  acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses at january 2 2021 the company reported 10038 billion of goodwill 2198 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 1858 billion of net definitelived intangibles 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its estimated fair value an impairment charge would be recorded for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2020 in accordance with accounting standards update asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test impairment tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units for its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2020 the company applied a quantitative test for all of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model based on the results of this testing it was determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its respective carrying amount by in excess of 40 with the exception of the infrastructure reporting unit as discussed below 

as previously disclosed in the companys form 10q for the third quarter of 2020 the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 16 in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january 2 2021 the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit which included approximately 585 million of goodwill at yearend the key assumptions applied to the updated cash flow projections for the infrastructure reporting unit included a 95 discount rate nearterm revenue growth rates over the next six years which represented a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4 and a 3 perpetual growth rate based on this analysis it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 23 the increase in excess fair value is reflective of an improved nearterm outlook based on results and trends in the fourth quarter of 2020 management remains confident in the longterm viability and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on its leading market position in its respective industries and the companys continued commitment to and investments in organic growth and margin resiliency initiatives 

for the company’s remaining reporting units the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 75 to 95 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next six years which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 3 to 5 and perpetual growth rates of 3 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models for these reporting units utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

the company also tested its indefinitelived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2020 utilizing a discounted cash flow model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales with the exception of an immaterial trade name the company determined that the fair values of its indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units or indefinitelived trade names do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existi ng at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at january 2 2021 for the united states and international pension plans were 239 and 131 respectively the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 28 2019 for the united states and international pension plans were 320 and 180 respectively as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 525 and 390 respectively at january 2 2021 the company will use a 316 w eightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2021 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2021 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 6 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 667 million at january 2 2021 a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 108 million at january 2 2021 the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized approximately 19 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2020 which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of january 2 2021 the company had reserves of 174 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 103 million to 245 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making this determination management considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing temporary differences estimates of future taxable income taxplanning strategies and the realizability of net operating 

loss carryforwards in the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made conversely if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made 

the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 which requires a twostep process first management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority the company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the companys tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months these changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits litigation or other proceedings with taxing authorities the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in item 7 and in other documents that the company files with the sec before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers in 2019 the two largest customers comprised approximately 25 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 40 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on the companys net sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

operations excellence an element of the new sbd operating model is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the operations excellence principles to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring 

actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences evolving industry standards or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation any inability to protect the companys other intellectual property rights could also reduce the value of its products and services or diminish its competitiveness 

the company considers its intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and licenses held to be a significant part and valuable aspect of its business the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 

the company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the companys success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

in addition the companys ability to compete could be negatively impacted by its failure to obtain and adequately protect its intellectual property rights including patents copyrights trade secrets and licenses as well as its products and any new features of its products or processes the companys patent applications may not be approved and any patents owned could be challenged invalidated or designed around by third parties in addition the companys patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage 

the successful execution of the companys business strategy depends on its ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and management personnel its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and 

motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth in addition the company must invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling its employees including placing an emphasis on lifelong learning a shortage of key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the pace of technological change continues to accelerate and the companys ability to react effectively to such change may present significant competitive risks 

the pace of technological change is increasing at an exponential rate the continued creation development and advancement of new technologies such as 5g data networks artificial intelligence blockchain quantum computing data analytics 3d printing robotics sensor technology data storage neural networks augmented reality amongst others as well as other technologies in the future that are not foreseen today continue to transform processes products and services the company will need to stay abreast of such technologies require its employees to continue to learn and adapt to new technologies and be able to integrate them into its current and future business models products services and processes and also guard against existing and new competitors disrupting its business using such technologies in addition the company will need to compete for talent that is familiar with such technologies including upskilling its workforce there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes which could result in a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political legal economic and other risks arising from operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows in early 2020 an outbreak of the coronavirus occurred in china and other jurisdictions the extent of the outbreak and its impact on the companys operations is uncertain a prolonged outbreak could cause interruptions to the companys operations and its customers and suppliers additionally the company is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws or sanctions regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations 

that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from including importation into the us of the companys products manufactured overseas may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions in recent years changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements have negatively impacted the company’s business for example in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that the company may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact the company’s results of operations furthermore imported products and materials may be subject to future tariffs or other trade measures in the us imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or failure by the company’s suppliers to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union eu or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

in addition the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the company’s computer systems and networks certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its thirdparty vendors cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out largescale complex automated attacks the company may not be able to 

anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting security breach or data loss in addition it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or thirdparty vendors 

breaches of the company’s technology and systems or those of the company’s vendors whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ websites applications data processing and certain products and services or disruption of other business operations furthermore any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about the company’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information “pii” the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that the company takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents including implementing and conducting training on insider trading policies for the company’s employees and maintaining contractual obligations for the company’s thirdparty vendors can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training organizational investments incident response plans table top exercises and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems products and services or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws   

to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to the company is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches similarly the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which was enacted in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1 2020 provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties the companys reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the company fails or is perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders in many cases these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the company and its subsidiaries all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time implementation of the gdpr and ccpa and other data localization laws will continue to require changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs or may result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and may subject the company to remedies that may harm its business including fines or demands or orders that the company modify or cease existing business practices 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions or other costs associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems including those of third parties to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the companys various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations and maintaining insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or computer viruses computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates additionally the company relies on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors and the companys business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such thirdparty systems 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations factors that are hard to predict or beyond the company’s control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt the company’s infrastructure or that of its suppliers or distributors if the company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations or cannot quickly repair damage to its information production or supply systems the company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected if a material or extended disruption occurs the company may lose its customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to its reputation and longterm consumer demand for its products and services could decline although the company maintains business interruption insurance it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions these events could materially and adversely affect the company’s product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

in addition many of the company’s products incorporate battery technology as other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the company’s supply chain in addition increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials if the company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints or related increased costs its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 41 of its revenues outside the us including 20 from europe and 13 from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales in these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 continuing uncertainty associated with brexit could adversely affect the company’s business 

while the uk parliament has voted to approve the withdrawaltransition agreement negotiated by the eu and the uk government significant uncertainty remains with respect to the impacts of brexit brexit could adversely affect european or worldwide political regulatory economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets any impact from brexit on the companys business and operations over the long term will depend in part on the outcome of tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other negotiations the uk conducts 

in particular the companys operations in the uk will be particularly exposed to the risks and uncertainties relating to brexit depending on the terms of brexit the uk could lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members the bank of england and other observers have warned of a significant probability of a brexitrelated recession in the uk volatility in exchanges rates including potential declines in the value of the british pound and in interest rates are also expected disruptions and uncertainty caused by brexit may also cause customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on the companys products and services these impacts could cause a significant decline in revenue as the company generates approximately 4 of its revenues in the uk in addition as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate brexit could lead to potentially divergent national laws and regulations which could result in an uncertain and difficult regulatory environment that could negatively impact the companys uk business 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates with respect to the effects on 

translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness and may in the future issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8  the company has a fiveyear 20 billion committed credit facility and a 364day 10 billion committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities at december 28 2019  

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions 

furthermore there could be a number of followon effects from a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as its access to the capital markets 

discontinuation reform or replacement of the london interbank offered rate libor and other benchmark rates or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing may adversely affect the company 

the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates these may be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” or other benchmark rates over the next several years the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets these changes and related uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing at this time the company cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of libor or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2019 the company completed the ies attachments acquisition as well as a number of other smaller acquisitions in addition the company reached an agreement in january 2020 to acquire consolidated aerospace manufacturing llc cam and may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage the pending cam acquisition and any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation andor adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states lastly it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation arrangements between the company and its distributors franchisees or vendors intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the company maintains an awareness of and responsibility for the potential health and safety impacts on its customers the companys product development processes include tollgates for product safety review and extensive testing is conducted on product safety safety reviews are performed at various product development milestones including a review of product labeling and marking to ensure safety and operational hazards are identified for the customer 

despite safety and quality reviews the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require or the company may voluntarily institute the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase the companys costs and adversely impact its reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has approximately 92 billion of goodwill approximately 22 billion of indefinitelived trade names and approximately 14 billion of net definitelived intangible assets at december 28 2019  the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2019  the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of approximately 48 million and expects to contribute 38 million to its defined benefit plans in 2020  

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at december 28 2019 was approximately 22 billion

extraordinary customer experience 

customers are increasingly demanding worldclass experiences from their brands and expectations for execution at the customer level are growing every day it is no longer sufficient to have great products on the shelf or in the catalog the company knows that to sustain market share growth it needs to evolve and adapt to provide the types of experiences that customers now expect while commercial excellence has always been an important part of sfs 20 and will continue to be part of the companys new model the companys new thrust in this area takes it to another level each of the companys businesses

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impacts of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2019 would have been an incremental pretax loss of approximately 37 million based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 158 million  or approximately 088 per diluted share in 2019  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 120 million  or approximately 067 per diluted share 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio 

including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its commercial paper program in which the pricing is partially based on shortterm us interest rates at december 28 2019  the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan esop section of mda additionally the company has 108 million of liabilities as of december 28 2019 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2019  2018  and 2017  investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a 323 million increase a 72 million decrease and a 217 million increase respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 38 million in 2020  the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ability to access equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan esop — as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in income of 05 million in 2019 and expense of 04 million in 2018 and 13 million in 2017  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines in addition esop expense will increase once all remaining unallocated shares are released which will occur in the first quarter of 2020 

critical accounting estimates — preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 

second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories — inventories in the us are primarily valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are primarily valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost and net realizable value the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market or net realizable value as applicable cost is used for inventory valuation if market value or net realizable value as applicable is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 35020 goodwill  acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses at december 28 2019  the company reported 9238 billion of goodwill 2186 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 1436 billion of net definitelived intangibles 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its estimated fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2019 in accordance with accounting standards update asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units accordingly for its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2019 the company applied the qualitative assessment for three of its reporting units while performing the quantitative test for two of its reporting units for the reporting units in which a quantitative test was performed it was noted that the fair value for each of these reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by in excess of 45 based on the results of the company’s annual impairment testing it was determined that the fair value of each of its reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount 

in performing the qualitative assessments the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as actual and planned financial performance the company also assessed changes in each reporting units fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed 

with respect to the quantitative tests the company assessed the fair values of the two reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 75 to 95 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which represented cumulative annual growth rates 

ranging from approximately 2 to 7 and perpetual growth rates of 3 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions based on the results of this testing the company determined that the fair value for each of these reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by in excess of 45 furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

the company also tested its indefinitelived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2019 utilizing a discounted cash flow model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units or indefinitelived trade names do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 28 2019 for the united states and international pension plans were 320 and 180  respectively the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 29 2018 for the united states and international pension plans were 420 and 262  respectively as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 625 and 473  respectively at december 28 2019  the company will use a 470 weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2020 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2020 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 631 million at december 28 2019  a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 93 million at december 28 2019  the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized approximately 15 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2019  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 28 2019  the company had reserves of 2138 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 1491 million to 2861 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making this determination management considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing temporary differences estimates of future taxable income taxplanning strategies and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards in the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made conversely if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made 

the act subjects a us shareholder to current tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries the financial accounting standards board fasb staff qa topic 740 no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income  states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred the company has elected to recognize the tax on gilti as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred 

the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 which requires a twostep process first management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority the company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the companys tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months these changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty 

additional information regarding income taxes is available in note q income taxes

liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 87 million and 86 million as of december 28 2019  and december 29 2018  respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in item 7 and in other documents that the company files with the sec before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers the two largest customers comprised approximately 22 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 37 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on net sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

core sfs  industry 40 is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the core sfs principles to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if 

such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences evolving industry standards or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the companys success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political legal economic and other risks arising from operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 



 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally the company is subject to complex us foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the uk bribery act of 2010 and other antibribery and anticorruption laws although the company has implemented internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices such measures may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations any determination that the company has violated antibribery or anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to the company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation its ability to attract and retain employees its business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from including importation into the us of the companys products manufactured overseas may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions for example changes in us policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact the company’s business in 2018 the us imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from china and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries additional tariffs imposed by the us on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that the company may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact the company’s results of operations furthermore imported products and materials may be subject to future tariffs or other trade measures in the us imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union eu or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these 

alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

in addition the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy compliance 

the company’s operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the company’s computer systems and networks certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its thirdparty vendors cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out largescale complex automated attacks the company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting security breach or data loss in addition it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or thirdparty vendors 

breaches of the company’s or the company’s vendors’ technology and systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking “phishing” attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data material interruptions or malfunctions in the company’s or such vendors’ websites applications data processing and certain products and services or disruption of other business operations furthermore any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company including information about the company’s business employees or customers as well as sensitive personally identifiable information “pii” the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft measures that the company takes to avoid detect mitigate or recover from material incidents including implementing and conducting training on insider trading policies for the company’s employees and maintaining contractual obligations for the company’s thirdparty vendors can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or may become ineffective 

to conduct its operations the company regularly moves data across national borders and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the laws that may be applicable to the company is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign laws for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders in many cases these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the company and its subsidiaries all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time implementation of the gdpr and data localization laws will continue to require changes to certain business practices thereby increasing costs or may result in negative publicity require significant management time and attention and may subject the company to remedies that may harm its business including fines or demands or orders that the company modify or cease existing business practices 

the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data including employee training organizational investments incident response plans table top exercises and technical defenses the cost and operational consequences of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threats despite the company’s best efforts it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the 

measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers any material breaches of cybersecurity including the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems products and services or those of the company’s third parties even if no breach has been attempted or occurred could cause the company to experience reputational harm loss of customers and revenue fines regulatory actions and scrutiny sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation liability for failure to safeguard the company’s customers’ information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions or other costs associated with information technology cyber attacks system implementations data privacy or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems including those of third parties to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations and maintaining insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or computer viruses computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates additionally the company relies on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors and the companys business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such thirdparty systems 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations factors that are hard to predict or beyond the company’s control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt the company’s infrastructure or that of its suppliers or distributors if the company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations or cannot quickly repair damage to its information production or supply systems the company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected if a material or extended disruption occurs the company may lose its customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to its reputation and longterm consumer demand for its products and services could decline although the company maintains business interruption insurance it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions these events could materially and adversely affect the company’s product sales financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

in addition many of the company’s products incorporate battery technology as other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the company’s supply chain in addition increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials if the company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints or related increased costs its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 45  of its revenues from outside the us including 22  from europe and 14  from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales from these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2018  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 1000 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 055  the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools 

including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in  note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8  the company has a fiveyear 20 billion  committed credit facility and a 364day 10 billion  committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities at december 29 2018  

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition changes in regulatory standards or industry practices such as the transition away from libor to the secured overnight financing rate sofr as a benchmark reference for shortterm interests could create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing 

furthermore there could be a number of followon effects from a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as its access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2018 the company completed the nelson acquisition as well as a number of other smaller acquisitions in addition the company reached an agreement to acquire international equipment solutions attachments group ies attachments which is expected to close in the first half of 2019 and may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage the pending ies attachments acquisition and any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation andor adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees 

fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states lastly it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 changes to us international taxation and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 following enactment of the act and the associated onetime transition tax in general repatriation of foreign earnings to the united states can be completed with no incremental us tax however repatriation of foreign earnings could subject the company to us state and nonus jurisdictional taxes including withholding taxes on distributions while repatriation of some foreign earnings held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of the company’s foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 could be repatriated to the united states pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” issued by the sec in december 2017 issuers were permitted up to one year from the enactment of the act to complete the accounting for the income tax effects of the act “the measurement period” the company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the act within the measurement period and has included those effects in income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation arrangements between the company and its distributors franchisees or vendors intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has approximately 90 billion  of goodwill approximately 22 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and approximately 13 billion  of net definitelived intangible assets at december 29 2018  the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2018  the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of approximately 45 million  and it expects to contribute 44 million  to its defined benefit plans in 2019  

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at december 29 2018  was approximately 20 billion

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able 

to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2018  would have been an incremental pretax loss of approximately 52 million based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 174 million or approximately 096 per diluted share in 2018  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 1000 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 055  

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us which is based on libor rates at december 29 2018  the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan esop section of mda additionally the company has 85 million of liabilities as of december 29 2018  pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2018  2017  and 2016  investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a 72 million  decrease a 217 million  increase and a 260 million increase respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 44 million  in 2019  the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ability to access equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of 

annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan esop   — as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 04 million  in 2018  income of 13 million  in 2017  and expense of 31 million  in 2016  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines in addition esop expense will increase once all remaining unallocated shares are released which could occur as early as 2019 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories — inventories in the us are primarily valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are primarily valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost and net realizable value the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market or net realizable value as applicable cost is used for inventory valuation if market value or net realizable value as applicable is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with asc 35020 goodwill  acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses at december 29 2018  the company reported 8957 billion  of goodwill 2199 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 1286 billion  of net definitelived intangibles 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its estimated fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2018 in accordance with accounting standards update asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units accordingly for its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2018 the company applied the qualitative assessment for two of its reporting units while performing the quantitative test for three of its reporting units based on the results of this testing the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in performing the qualitative assessments the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as actual and planned financial performance the company also assessed changes in each reporting units fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed 

with respect to the quantitative tests the company assessed the fair values of the three reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 80 to 95 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 5 to 8 and perpetual growth rates of 3 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions based on the results of this testing the company determined that the fair values of each of the three reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

the company also tested its indefinitelived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2018 utilizing a discounted cash flow model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units or indefinitelived trade names do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 29 2018  for the united states and international pension plans were 420  and 262  respectively the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 30 2017  for the united states and international pension plans were 353  and 224  respectively as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 625  and 437  respectively at december 29 2018  the company will use a 551  weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2019 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2019 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using 

the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 616 million  at december 29 2018  a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 81 million at december 29 2018  the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 4 million  of defined benefit plan income in 2018  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 29 2018  the company had reserves of 2466 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 2140 million  to 3443 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making this determination management considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing temporary differences estimates of future taxable income taxplanning strategies and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards in the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made conversely if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made 

the act subjects a us shareholder to current tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries the financial accounting standards board fasb staff qa topic 740 no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income  states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred the company has elected to recognize the tax on gilti as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred 

the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 which requires a twostep process first management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority the company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes many factors are considered when evaluating 

and estimating the companys tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months these changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission sec before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers the two largest customers comprised approximately 21 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 29 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on net sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

core sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business 

processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the core sfs principles to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the companys success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from including importation into the us of our products manufactured overseas may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions furthermore imported products and materials may be subject to future tariffs or other trade measures in the us imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions or other costs associated with information technology cyber attacks system implementations data privacy or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or computer viruses computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates additionally the company relies on software applications and enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors and our business may be adversely affected by service disruptions or security breaches in such thirdparty systems 

security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s information technology systems cloud storage systems networks services and assets as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the company’s customers data if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches including as a result of human error and technological failures and business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations as well as reputational competitive or business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

the company is also subject to us and international data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations which may impose fines and penalties for noncompliance and may have an adverse effect on the companys operations for example the european union’s general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which becomes effective in may 2018 extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents regardless of the companys location and imposes significant new requirements on how the company collects processes and transfers personal data 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the companys operations disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for the companys products and make it difficult or impossible to manufacture products deliver products to customers or receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

in addition many of the company’s products incorporate battery technology as other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the company’s supply chain in addition increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials if the company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints or related increased costs its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 46 of its revenues from outside the us including 22  of its revenues from europe and 14  from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales from these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 



the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2017  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 124 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 007  the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in  note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8  the company has a fiveyear 175 billion committed credit facility and a 364day 125 billion committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities at december 30 2017  

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as its access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2017 the company completed the acquisitions of newell tools and the craftsman brand as well as a number of other smaller acquisitions in addition the company recently reached an agreement to purchase the nelson fastener systems industrial business which is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage the pending acquisition and any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states lastly it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “act” the act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 2 requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 4 requiring a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which is a current inclusion in us federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations 5 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax amt and changing how existing amt credits can be realized 6 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax beat 7 creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and 8 changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after december 31 2017 

pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” issued by the sec in december 2017 issuers are permitted up to one year from the enactment of the act to complete the accounting for the income tax effects of the act see note a significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8 for further information about sab 118 as of december 30 2017 the company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the act however in certain cases as described in note q income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8 the company has   made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax in other cases the company has not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continues to account for those items based on existing accounting guidance under accounting standards codification asc 740 income taxes  and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment during the fourth quarter of 2017 a provisional net charge of 236 million was recognized for the items the company was able to reasonably estimate which has been included as a component of income taxes on continuing operations the final impacts of the act may be materially different from current estimates which are based on management’s preliminarily analysis of currently available information in all cases estimates of the impact of the act may be updated to account for changes in interpretations of the act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the act and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the act the company will continue to examine the impact that the act may have on its operations in future periods notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall net impact of the legislation remains uncertain and could adversely impact the companys results of operations or financial condition 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has 88 billion  of goodwill 22 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 13 billion  of net definitelived intangible assets at december 30 2017  the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2017  the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 67 million  and it expects to contribute 41 million  to its defined benefit plans in 2018  

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at december 30 2017  was 2213 billion  

risks associated with hostilities involving north korea 

the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars crosscurrency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2017  would have been an incremental pretax loss of approximately 50 million based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 147 million or approximately 077 per diluted share in 2017  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 124 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 007  

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us which is based on libor rates at december 30 2017  the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan esop section of mda additionally the company has 87 million of liabilities as of december 30 2017  pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2017  2016  and 2015  investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a 217 million  increase a 260 million increase and an 11 million decrease respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 41 million  in 2018  the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ability to access equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan  as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 13 million  in 2017  income of 31 million  in 2016  and expense of 08 million  in 2015  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a 

significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are primarily valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are primarily valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost and net realizable value the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market or net realizable value as applicable cost is used for inventory valuation if market value or net realizable value as applicable is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with asc 35020 goodwill  acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses at december 30 2017  the company reported 8776 billion  of goodwill 2206 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 1302 billion  of net definitelived intangibles 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its estimated fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2017 beginning in 2013 the company adopted asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  for its goodwill impairment testing asu 201108 permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units accordingly the company applied the qualitative assessment for two of its reporting units while performing the quantitative test for three of its reporting units based on the results of the annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2017 the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in performing the qualitative assessments the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as actual and planned financial performance the company also assessed changes in each reporting units fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed 

with respect to the quantitative tests the company assessed the fair values of the three reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 85 to 90 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 4 to 7 and perpetual growth rates of 3 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions based on the results of this testing the company determined that the fair values of each of the three reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

as previously disclosed in the companys form 10q for the third quarter of 2017 the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 18 in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 30 2017 the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit which included approximately 271 million of goodwill at yearend based on this analysis which included updated assumptions of nearterm revenue and profitability levels it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 37 the increase in excess fair value is reflective of an improved nearterm outlook due to solid results in 2017 including robust organic growth of 12 management remains confident in the longterm viability and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on its leading market position in its respective industries and the companys continued commitment to and investments in organic growth initiatives including solid progress being made with respect to breakthrough innovation projects under sfs 20 

the company also tested its indefinitelived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2017 utilizing both qualitative assessments and quantitative tests for the qualitative assessments the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each trade name these factors primarily included macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as the trade names actual and planned financial performance as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the trade names exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed for the quantitative impairment tests the company utilized a discounted cash flow model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units or indefinitelived trade names do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 30 2017  for the united states and international pension plans were 353  and 224  respectively the company’s weightedaverage discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 2016 for the united states and international pension plans were 395  and 238  respectively as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 625  and 441  respectively at december 30 2017  the company will use a 530  weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2018 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2018 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 650 million  at december 30 2017  a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 98 million at december 30 2017  the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 19 million  of defined benefit plan expense in 2017  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 30 2017  the company had reserves of 1761 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 1434 million  to 2771 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in making this determination management considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing temporary differences estimates of future taxable income taxplanning strategies and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards in the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made conversely if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made 

the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 740 which requires a twostep process first management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority the company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes on continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the companys tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to 

certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months these changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no single customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2016  however the two largest customers comprised approximately 19 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 28  of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on net sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the core sfs principles to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the companys success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from including importation into the us of our products manufactured overseas may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions furthermore imported products and materials may be subject to future border adjustment taxes or tariffs in the us imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology cyber attacks system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or computer viruses computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

further security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s information technology systems networks services and assets as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the company’s data if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations as well as reputational competitive or business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions 

may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the companys operations disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for the companys products and make it difficult or impossible to manufacture products deliver products to customers or receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices and there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 48 of its revenues from outside the us including 23  of its revenues from europe and 16  from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales from these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 



 the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2016  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 155 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 082  the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8  the company has a fiveyear 175 billion committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against this facility at december 31 2016  

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

in addition to a number of smaller acquisitions completed in recent years the company has also entered into definitive agreements in october 2016 and january 2017 to acquire newell tools and the craftsman brand respectively the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage the pending acquisitions and any future acquisitions or general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted lastly the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has 66940 million  of goodwill 15085 million  of indefinitelived trade names and 7910 million  of net definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2016  these amounts exclude approximately 3028 million of goodwill 652 million of an indefinitelived trade name and 318 million of net definitelived intangibles that are classified within assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 refer to note t divestitures  for further discussion the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2016  the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 57 million  and it expects to contribute 66 million  to its defined benefit plans in 2017  

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at december 31 2016  was 2082 billion  

risks associated with hostilities involving north korea 

the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers

strategic objectives 

the company continues to employ the following strategic framework 

 the company is continuing to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue earnings and cash flow growth the company also remains focused on growing organically including increasing its presence in emerging markets with a goal of generating greater than 20 of annual revenues from those markets over time and leveraging sfs 20 focused on upgrading innovation and digital capabilities while maintaining commercial and supply chain excellence and funding required investments in part through functional transformation strategic acquisitions combined with strong organic growth performance will help enable the company to reach its objective of doubling its size to 22 billion in revenue by 2022 while expanding the margin rate furthermore the companys strategic framework including its focus on diversification has driven continued improvements in financial performance sales outside the us represented 48 of total net sales in 2016  up from 29 in 2002 while sales to us and international home centers and mass merchants have decreased to 28  of total sales in 2016  compared to 31 in 2010

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 



  

 

to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax liabilities the related amount will be included in the table above however due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the 3754 million of such liabilities at december 31 2016  the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 

aside from debt payments for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal and tax obligations payments of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars cross currency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures the assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2016  would have been approximately 6 million incremental pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 123 million or approximately 065 per diluted share in 2016  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 155 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 082  

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us which is based on libor rates at december 31 2016  the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan section of mda additionally the company has 70 million of liabilities as of december 31 2016  pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2016  2015  and 2014  

investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in a 260 million  increase an 11 million decrease and a 285 million increase respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 66 million  in 2017  the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan  as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in income of 31 million  in 2016  and expense of 08 million  in 2015  and 07 million  in 2014  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are primarily valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are primarily valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a writedown to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value a writedown would be recorded 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with asc 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses at december 31 2016  the company reported 66940 million  of goodwill 15085 million  of indefinitelived trade names and 7910 million  of net definitelived intangibles these amounts exclude approximately 3028 million of goodwill 652 million of an indefinitelived trade name and 318 million of net definitelived intangibles that are classified within assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2016 refer to note t divestitures  for further discussion 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its estimated fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2016 beginning in 2013 the company adopted asu 201108 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” for its goodwill impairment testing asu 201108 permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units accordingly the company applied the qualitative assessment for four of its reporting units while performing the quantitative test for its infrastructure reporting unit based on the results of the annual 2016 impairment testing the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in performing the qualitative assessment the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as actual and planned financial performance the company also assessed changes in each reporting units fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed 

with respect to the quantitative test the company assessed the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections included a 9 discount rate nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which represented a cumulative annual growth rate of approximately 5 and a 3 perpetual growth rate these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions based on the results of this testing the company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair value resulting from the discounted cash flow valuation model utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with its quarterly forecasting cycle the company updated the forecasted operating results for each of its businesses based on the most recent financial results and best estimates of future operations the updated forecasts reflected an expected decline in nearterm revenue growth and profitability for the infrastructure reporting unit within the industrial segment primarily due to ongoing difficult market conditions in the oil  gas industry mainly related to project delays as a result of continued geopolitical challenges and a cyclical slowdown in offshore pipeline activity as well as a slower than expected recovery in the scrap steel market accordingly in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit which included approximately 269 million of goodwill at yearend based on this analysis which included revised assumptions of nearterm revenue growth and profitability levels it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 14 therefore management concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment had occurred management is confident in the longterm viability 

and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on the strong longterm growth prospects of the markets and geographies served the companys continued commitment to and investments in organic growth initiatives including solid progress being made with respect to breakthrough innovation projects under the sfs 20 program and infrastructures leading market position in its respective industries 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analyses while useful should not be used as a sole predictor of potential impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

the company also tested its indefinitelived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2016 utilizing both qualitative assessments and quantitative tests for the qualitative assessments the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each trade name these factors primarily included macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as the trade names actual and planned financial performance as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the trade names exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed for the quantitative impairment tests the company utilized a discounted cash flow model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 400  and 250  respectively at december 31 2016  the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 425  and 325  respectively at january 2 2016 as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 650  and 475  respectively at december 31 2016  the company will use a 535  weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2017 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2017 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 691 million  at december 31 2016  a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 90 million at december 31 2016  the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 12 million  of defined benefit plan expense in 2016  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities 

recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 31 2016  the company had reserves of 1609 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 1283 million  to 2671 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses and capital losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not”   that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers all positive and negative evidence including estimates of future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes for further discussion 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases insurance coverage only for severe losses that are unlikely and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different self insured retentions in the form of deductibles and self insurance through its captive insurance company exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum self insured retention is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a period of approximately 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 89 million and 96 million as of december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the 

warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 103 million  reserve for expected warranty claims as of december 31 2016  is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both companyinitiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for certain locations including one of its major distribution centers the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 1 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2016  as of december 31 2016  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 67 million  and 58 million  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no single customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2015  however the two largest customers comprised nearly 18 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 27  of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic conditions the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event 

the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase 

costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology cyber attacks system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or computer viruses computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

further security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s information technology systems networks services and assets as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the company’s data if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations as well as reputational competitive or business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the companys operations disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for its products and make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture its products deliver products to customers or to receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the us could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 47 of its revenues from outside the us including 22 of its revenues from europe and 16 from various emerging market countries each of the company’s segments generates sales from these marketplaces while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2015  translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 220 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 113  the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8  the company has an amended and restated fiveyear 175 billion  committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against this facility at january 2 2016  

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

  

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years including but not limited to infastech jiangsu guoqiang tools gq and niscayah the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions and general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to 

audit based on the most currently available information which involves inherent uncertainty the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome of any audit or related litigation could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax accruals additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted lastly the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar since a significant amount of the company’s earnings are generated outside the united states 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to writedown all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has 7084 billion  of goodwill 1578 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 0964 billion  of definitelived intangible assets at january 2 2016  the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2015  the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 66 million  and it expects to contribute 52 million  to its defined benefit plans in 2016 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at january 2 2016  was 2129 billion  

legal or technological hurdles associated with the expansion of use of rfid and rtls technologies in company products could adversely affect the companys growth initiatives and long term results 

the companys growth initiatives call for expansions of use of rfid and rtls technologies both geographically and through incorporation of these technologies into new products in connection with these activities the company may encounter both technological difficulties and legal impediments including but not limited to design requirements ownership claims and licensing or permitting requirements that could delay or prevent the use of these technologies in certain products andor in certain geographies any such impediments could adversely impact the companys plans for growth and future results 

risks associated with hostilities involving north korea 

the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers

strategic objectives 

the company continues to employ the following strategic framework 

 the company is continuing to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue earnings and cash flow growth the company is focused on growing organically including increasing its presence in emerging markets with a goal of generating greater than 20 of annual revenues from those markets and leveraging the stanley fulfillment system a now expanded program focused on breakthrough innovation and digital capabilities while accelerating commercial and supply chain excellence and funding these required investments through functional transformation these objectives have been significantly enhanced by the black  decker merger which along with the impact from the company’s diversification strategy has driven continued improvements in financial performance sales outside the us represented 47 of total net sales in 2015  up from 29 in 2002 as further illustration of this diversification strategy sales to us and international home centers and mass merchants accounted for approximately 27  of total sales in 2015  compared to 31 in 2010 

execution of the above strategy has resulted in approximately 62 billion of acquisitions since 2002 aside from the black  decker merger several divestitures including the sale of hhi in december 2012 increased brand investment improved efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing operation and enhanced investments in organic growth enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity over the last decade the company has returned approximately 50 of normalized free cash flow to its shareowners

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 



  

 32 

 

to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax liabilities the related amount will be included in the table above however due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the 3439 million of such liabilities at january 2 2016 the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 

aside from debt payments for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal tax obligations and the equity purchase contract fees payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices bond prices and commodity prices amongst others 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the euro canadian dollar british pound australian dollar brazilian real argentine peso the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars cross currency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures the assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2015 would have been approximately 27 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company generally does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the 

combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 132 million or approximately 068 per diluted share in 2015 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 220 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 113  

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at january 2 2016 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan section of mda additionally the company has 59 million of liabilities as of january 2 2016 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2015 2014 and 2013 there was an 110 million  decrease and 285 million and 102 million increase respectively in investment returns on pension plan assets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 52 million  in 2016 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan  as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 08 million  in 2015  07 million  in 2014  and 19 million  in 2013  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higherthanexpected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lastin firstout “lifo” cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of firstin firstout “fifo” cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a writedown to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with asc 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is morelikelythannot an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is morelikelythannot that an impairment exists goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 7084 billion  of goodwill 1578 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 0964 billion  of definitelived intangibles at january 2 2016  

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

during the third quarter of 2015 as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment the company assessed the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 8 to 105 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which ranged from 2 to 10 and perpetual growth rates ranging from 3 to 35 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions based on the results of this testing the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts furthermore management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rates and perpetual growth rates in each of the reporting units the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rates were decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

the fair values of indefinitelived trade names were also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection with its quarterly forecasting cycle the company updated the forecasted operating results for each of its businesses based on the most recent financial results and best estimates of future operations the updated forecasts reflected an expected decline in nearterm revenue growth and profitability for the infrastructure reporting unit within the industrial segment primarily due to ongoing difficult market conditions in the oil  gas industry particularly in certain markets such as china and russia as well as continued declines in scrap steel prices accordingly in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january 2 2016 the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit which included approximately 273 million of goodwill at yearend based on this analysis which included revised assumptions of nearterm revenue growth and profitability levels it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 13 therefore management concluded it was not morelikelythannot that an impairment had occurred management is confident in the longterm viability and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on the strong longterm growth prospects of the markets and geographies served the intensified focus and investments being made in organic growth initiatives bolstered by the recently implemented sfs 20 program and infrastructures leading market position in its respective industries 

in the event that future operating results of any of the companys reporting units do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analyses while useful should not be used as a sole predictor of potential impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 425  and 325  respectively at january 2 2016  the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 375  and 325  respectively at january 3 2015 as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 650  and 525  respectively at january 2 2016  the company will use a 560  weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2016 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2016 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million on a pretax basis 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 692 million  at january 2 2016  a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 85 million at january 2 2016  the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 11 million  of defined benefit plan expense in 2015  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation 

progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of january 2 2016  the company had reserves of 1707 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 1304 million  to 2608 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses and capital losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not”   that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers all positive and negative evidence including estimates of future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes for further discussion 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases insurance coverage only for severe losses that are unlikely and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different self insured retentions in the form of deductibles and self insurance through its captive insurance company exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum self insured retention is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a period of approximately 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 96 million and 102 million as of january 2 2016 and january 3 2015 respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 105 million  reserve for expected warranty claims as of january 2 2016 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting 

future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both companyinitiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for certain locations including one of its major distribution centers as well as certain us personal property predominantly vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 1 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2015  as of january 2 2016  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 40 million  and 34 million  respectively

competition 

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands its commitment to customer service strong customer relationships the breadth of its product lines and its innovative products and customer value propositions

major customers 

a significant portion of the company’s cdiy products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers has provided the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss as a result of the company’s acquisition strategy sales to us home centers and mass merchants declined from a high of approximately 40 in 2002 to 15 before the black  decker merger in 2014 sales to us home centers and mass merchants were 19 as acquisitions in the various growth platforms are made in future years the proportion of sales to these valued us home center and mass merchant customers is expected to continue to decrease to levels existing prior to the black  decker merger

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2014 however the two largest customers comprised nearly 16 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 23 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic condition the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

the company generates revenue outside of the united states and expects it to continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology cyber attacks system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures or computer viruses computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

further security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the company’s information technology systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the company’s data if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches and business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations as well as reputational competitive or business harm which may adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as 

opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the companys operations disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for its products and make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture its products deliver products to customers or to receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the european union eu the risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on the european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 25  of its revenues from europe each of the company’s segments generate sales from the european marketplace with the sales activity being somewhat concentrated within france the nordic region germany and the uk while the company believes any downturn in the european marketplace would be offset to some degree by sales growth in emerging markets and relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 11 

 the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian latin american and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2014 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 85 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 042  the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8  the company has a five year 15 billion  committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against this facility at january 3 2015 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

  

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions as well as general business reorganizations may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations 

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years including but not limited to infastech a 60 controlling share in jiangsu guoqiang tools gq and niscayah the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions and general business reorganizations and mitigate the related risks may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs significant restructuring costs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic sales and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company as income tax expense future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the companys prospective income tax expense 

pursuant to the rules of asc 740 accounting for income taxes income tax payments made may differ from the total income tax expense recorded primarily due to deferred taxes and income tax reserves the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the companys worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the companys income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the companys worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has 7276 billion  of goodwill 1593 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 1159 billion  of definitelived intangible assets at january 3 2015  the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2014 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 155 million  and it expects to contribute 94 million  to its defined benefit plans in 2015 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at january 3 2015  was 2290 billion  

legal or technological hurdles associated with the expansion of use of rfid and rtls technologies in company products could adversely affect the companys growth initiatives and long term results 

the companys growth initiatives call for expansions of use of rfid and rtls technologies both geographically and through incorporation of these technologies into new products in connection with these activities the company may encounter both technological difficulties and legal impediments including but not limited to design requirements ownership claims and licensing or permitting requirements that could delay or prevent the use of these technologies in certain products andor in certain geographies any such impediments could adversely impact the companys plans for growth and future results 

risks associated with hostilities involving north korea 

the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers

strategic objectives 

the company has maintained a consistent strategic framework over time 

 in 2012 the company intensified its focus on organic growth in order to achieve its longterm objective of 46 organic growth stanleys strategy involves industry geographic and customer diversification in order to pursue sustainable revenue earnings and cash flow growth 

two aspects of the company’s vision are to be a consolidator within the tool industry and to increase its presence in emerging markets with a goal of ultimately generating greater than 20 of annual revenues from emerging markets these objectives have been significantly enhanced by the black  decker merger which along with the impact from the company’s diversification strategy has driven continued improvements in financial performance sales outside the us represented 51 of total net sales in 2014  up from 29 in 2002 as further illustration of the companys diversification strategy 2014  sales to us and international home centers and mass merchants were approximately 23 including nearly 16 in sales to the company’s two largest customers which is down from 31 in 2010 including 20 in sales to the companys two largest customers as operations in the various growth platforms within the industrial and security segments continue to expand in future years the proportion of sales to these valued us and international home centers and mass merchants is expected to continue to decrease although they will remain important and highly valued customers 

execution of the above strategy has resulted in approximately 62 billion of acquisitions since 2002 aside from the black  decker merger several divestitures including the sale of hhi in december 2012 increased brand investment improved efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing operation and enhanced investments in organic growth enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity over the last decade the company has returned approximately 50 of normalized free cash flow to its shareowners 

the company’s longterm financial objectives are 

 the company’s longterm capital allocation objectives pertaining to the deployment of free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures are 

 as mentioned previously the company has intensified its focus on increasing organic growth concentrated in five major areas during the next few years 1 increase presence in emerging markets in the power tools hand tools and commercial hardware midprice point categories 2 create a smart tools and storage market using radio frequency identification rfid and realtime locating system rtls technology 3 utilize technology to create differentiated solutions to satisfy vertical market demand for the electronic security business focus on banking retail healthcare  education 4 expand offshore oil and gas pipeline service revenue in the companys oil  gas business and 5 continue to identify and realize revenue synergies associated with several acquisitions and the black  decker merger 

in terms of capital allocation the company plans to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders by continuing its pause in strategic merger and acquisition activity possibly commencing small bolt on acquisitions in the latter half of 2015 continued dividend growth and reducing its basic share count by the share equivalent of up to 1 billion worth of shares by the end of 2015 the company expects the impact of its share repurchase activities to include the efficient use of equity derivatives to reduce and manage the timing of the capital requirements of this program which could result in cash settlement through 2017

cash payments for dividends were 321 million 313 million and 304 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in dividends in 2014 was primarily attributable to the increase in quarterly dividends per common share to 052 per share as announced in july 2014 the dividend paid to shareholders of record in december 2014 extended the companys record for the longest consecutive annual and quarterly dividend payments among industrial companies listed on the new york stock exchange 

fluctuations in foreign currency rates negatively impacted cash by 147 million and 45 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively the negative impact in 2014 was primarily driven by the continued strengthening of the us dollar particularly in the second half of the year against the companys major currencies most notably the euro british pound canadian dollar swedish krona and japanese yen 

credit ratings and liquidity 

the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a as well as its shortterm commercial paper borrowings in october 2014 fitch changed their outlook on their a rating of the company’s sr debt from negative to stable there were no other changes in any of the companies credit ratings during 2014 

the companys debt capacity for its current ratings is impacted by the level of long including current maturities and shortterm debt as presented in its financial statements as well as other obligations that ratings agencies and fixed income investors deem to increase the level of financial burden on the company those other obligations include among other things postretirement benefits as presented in its financial statements postretirement benefit obligations and thereby the companys debt capacity and its credit rating could potentially be impacted by significant reductions in interest rates and revisions to mortality tables as well as any corrections in the equity markets the companys projected benefit obligation at january 3 2015 was relatively consistent compared to december 28 2013 as the positive impacts from the favorable return on plan assets higher employer contributions and foreign currency fluctuations offset the negative impacts from the revision in mortality tables and decrease in discount rates refer to note l employee benefit plans for further discussion 

failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to access committed credit facilities

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity

to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax liabilities the related amount will be included in the table above however due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the 3414 million of such liabilities at january 3 2015 the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 

aside from debt payments for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal tax obligations and the equity purchase contract fees payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above

shortterm borrowings longterm debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian latin american and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars cross currency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables primarily for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company may also enter into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2014 would have been approximately 36 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 124 million or approximately 062 per diluted share in 2014 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 85 million  and diluted earnings per share by approximately 042  

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at january 3 2015 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan section of mda additionally the company has 54 million of liabilities as of january 3 2015 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2014 2013 and 2012 there were 285 million 102 million and 194 million respectively in investment returns on pension plan assets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 94 million in 2015 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan  as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 07 million in 2014  19 million in 2013  and 259 million in 2012  the decrease in net esop expense in 2014  and 2013 is related to the release of 230032 and 219900 shares respectively of unallocated stock triggered by an additional contribution to the esop which was used by the esop to make an additional payment on the associated loan as 

more fully discussed in note l employee benefit plans  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with asc 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definitelived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 7276 billion  of goodwill 1593 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 1159 billion  of definitelived intangibles at january 3 2015  

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2014 beginning in 2013 the company adopted asu 201108 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” for its goodwill impairment testing asu 201108 permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount 

including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units accordingly the company applied the qualitative assessment for four of its reporting units while performing the twostep quantitative test for the remaining two reporting units based on the results of the annual 2014 impairment testing the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in performing the qualitative assessment the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as actual and planned financial performance the company also assessed changes in each reporting units fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed 

with respect to the twostep quantitative tests the company assessed the fair value of the two reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model which is consistent with previous goodwill impairment tests the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 85 to 90 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which ranged from 0 to 7 and a perpetual growth rate of 35 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rates and perpetual growth rate in each of the reporting units the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated 

the fair values of indefinitelived trade names were also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that the company’s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analyses while a useful tool should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 375  and 325  respectively at january 3 2015  the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 450  and 400  respectively at december 28 2013 as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 700  and 575  respectively at january 3 2015  the company will use a 590  weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2015 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2015 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million pretax 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 781 million  at january 3 2015  this projected benefit obligation reflects the adoption of new mortality tables used for the companys us pension and postretirement plans a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 103 million at january 3 2015  the 

primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 16 million  of defined benefit plan expense in 2014  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of january 3 2015  the company had reserves of 1773 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 1357 million  to 2689 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses and capital losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not”   that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers all positive and negative evidence including estimates of future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company is subject to tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases insurance coverage only for severe losses that are unlikely and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different self insured retentions in the form of deductibles and self insurance through its captive insurance company exist for 

each of these lines of insurance the maximum self insured retention is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a period of approximately 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 102 million and 105 million as of january 3 2015 and december 28 2013 respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 110 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of january 3 2015 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for certain locations including one of its major distribution centers as well as certain us personal property predominantly vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 1 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2014  as of january 3 2015  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 39 million and 34 million respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2013 however the two largest customers comprised nearly 15 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 24 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic condition the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in 2014 and beyond may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

the company generates revenue outside of the united states and expects it to continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the companys operations disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for its products and make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture its products deliver products to customers or to receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics resins wood and corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the european union eu the risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on the european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

the company generates approximately 26 of its revenues from europe each of the company’s segments generate sales from the european marketplace with the sales activity being somewhat concentrated within france the nordic region germany and the uk while the company believes any downturn in the european marketplace would be offset to some degree by sales growth in emerging markets and relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 11 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian latin american and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2013 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 60 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately 030 the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item 8  the company has a five year 15 billion  committed credit facility and a 500 million  364 day committed credit facility no amounts were outstanding against these facilities at december 28 2013 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

  

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s longterm growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2013 the company completed the acquisition of infastech and purchased a 60 controlling share in jiangsu guoqiang tools gq as well as a number of smaller acquisitions in 2012 the company completed seven smaller acquisitions in 2011 the company completed the acquisition of niscayah and nine smaller acquisitions prior to 2010 along with the merger the company completed a number of acquisitions including but not limited to crcevans gdp sonitrol and xmark the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s longterm growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of recent acquisitions in 2013 the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic sales and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company as income tax expense future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the companys prospective income tax expense 

pursuant to the rules of asc 740 accounting for income taxes income tax payments made may differ from the total income tax expense recorded primarily due to deferred taxes and income tax reserves the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the companys worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the companys income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the companys worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions the company has 76 billion of goodwill 16 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 15 billion of definitelived intangible assets at december 28 2013 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2013 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 110 million and it expects to contribute 101 million to its defined benefit plans in 2014 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at december 28 2013 was 2129 billion 

legal or technological hurdles associated with the expansion of use of rfid and rtls technologies in company products could adversely affect the companys growth initiatives and long term results 

the companys growth initiatives call for expansions of use of rfid and rtls technologies both geographically and through incorporation of these technologies into new products in connection with these activities the company may encounter both technological difficulties and legal impediments including but not limited to design requirements ownership claims and licensing or permitting requirements that could delay or prevent the use of these technologies in certain products andor in certain geographies any such impediments could adversely impact the companys plans for growth and future results 

risks associated with hostilities involving north korea 

the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea escalation of hostilities with north korea andor military action in the region could cause disruptions in the companys supply chain which could in turn cause product shortages delays in delivery andor increases in the companys cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers

strategic objectives 

the company has maintained a consistent strategic framework over time 

 in 2012 the company undertook to intensify its focus on organic growth in order to achieve its longterm objective of 46 organic growth stanleys strategy involves industry geographic and customer diversification in order to pursue sustainable revenue earnings and cash flow growth 

two aspects of the company’s vision are to be a consolidator within the tool industry and to increase its relative weighting in emerging markets these objectives have been significantly enhanced by the black  decker merger which along with the impact from the company’s diversification strategy has driven continued improvements in financial performance sales outside the us represented 53 of total net sales in 2013 up from 29 in 2002 as further illustration of the companys diversification strategy 2013 sales to us and international home centers and mass merchants were approximately 24 including nearly 15 in sales to the company’s two largest customers as operations in the various growth platforms security engineered fastening and infrastructure continue to expand in future years the proportion of sales to these valued us and international home centers and mass merchants is expected to continue to decrease although they will remain important and highly valued customers 

execution of this strategy has entailed approximately 62 billion of acquisitions since 2002 aside from the black  decker merger several divestitures including the sale of hhi in december 2012 and increased brand investment enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity since 2000 the company has returned 50 of free cash flow to its shareowners

results of operations 

below is a summary of the company’s operating results at the consolidated level followed by an overview of business segment performance 

terminology the term “organic” is utilized to describe results aside from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods 

net sales net sales were 11001 billion  in 2013  up 8  compared to 10148 billion  in 2012  acquisitions and organic sales volume provided increases of 6 and 3 in net sales respectively while unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of 1 in net sales overall pricing was relatively flat from 2012 to 2013 in the cdiy segment organic sales increased 4 compared to 2012  as a result of successful new product introductions and promotions within the d e walt black  decker and bostitch power tool lines as well as market share gains in the us europe and emerging markets due to the implementation of organic growth initiatives in the industrial segment organic sales grew 5 relative to 2012  due to strong organic growth in the oil  gas industrial  automotive repair and engineered fastening businesses while acquisitions primarily infastech provided an additional 17 increase to net sales in the security segment sales increased approximately 1 compared to 2012 mainly due to modest increases in price and acquisitions as well as favorable impacts of foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by lower sales volumes in the european business 

net sales were 10148 billion in 2012  as compared to 9377 billion  in 2011  an 8  increase organic sales volume provided a 2 increase in net sales and the impact of acquisitions provided an additional 8 increase while unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of 2 in net sales the cdiy segment grew 5 organically in comparison to 2011  which was driven by successful new product introductions and market share gains under the d e walt and black  decker brands in the industrial segment organic sales grew 1 relative to 2011  due to strong organic growth in the engineered fastening business which was partially offset by iar exposure to weakening european markets and declines in the infrastructure business due to lagging results in the onshore pipeline business organic net sales in the security segment declined 4 compared to 2011  which was attributable to a difficult european market impacting the css business and weakness within the mas business in the us tied to slow commercial construction as well as soft national account spending 

gross profit the company reported gross profit of 3933 billion  or 357  of net sales in 2013  compared to 3696 billion  or 364  of net sales in 2012  merger and acquisitionrelated charges which reduced gross profit were approximately 30 million in both 2013  and 2012  excluding these charges gross profit was 360 of net sales in 2013  and 367 of net sales in 2012  the decrease in the profit rate year over year was primarily driven by lower security margins due to sales volume decline field service inefficiencies and high european rmr attrition and negative impacts from foreign currency which more than outweighed the positive impacts of higher volumes productivity projects and cost synergies 

the company reported gross profit of 3696 billion  or 364  of net sales in 2012  compared to 3451 billion  or 368  of net sales in 2011  merger and acquisitionrelated charges which reduced gross profit were approximately 30 million in 2012 compared to 21 million in 2011 excluding these charges gross profit was 367 of net sales in 2012 and 370 of net sales in 2011 the decrease in the profit rate year over year was primarily due to negative mix driven by higher revenues in cdiy which had lower profit margins than security and industrial these factors outweighed the positive impacts from productivity projects and margin improvement initiatives 

sga expense selling general and administrative expenses inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts “sga” were 2715 billion  or 247  of net sales in 2013  as compared 2500 billion  or 246  of net sales in 2012  within sga merger and acquisitionrelated compensation costs and integrationrelated expenses totaled 1363 million and 1384 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively excluding these charges sga was 234 of net sales in 2013 compared to 233 of net sales in 2012 the slight increase in sga rate was mainly attributable to higher expenses associated with the organic growth initiatives and increased sales volume partially offset by cost synergies and continued cost containment efforts 

sga expenses were 2500 billion  or 246  of net sales in 2012  as compared with 2358 billion  or 250  of net sales in 2011  within sga merger and acquisitionrelated compensation costs and integrationrelated expenses totaled 1384 million and 983 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively excluding these charges sga was 233 of net sales in 2012 compared to 241 of net sales in 2011 the favorable sga rate was mainly driven by sales volume leverage cost synergies and cost containment efforts 

distribution center costs ie warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs are classified within sga this classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales due to diversity in practice to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies the company’s gross margins may not 

be comparable such distribution costs classified in sga amounted to 2304 million  in 2013 2030 million  in 2012 and 2022 million  in 2011  

corporate overhead  the corporate overhead element of sga and gross profit which is not allocated to the business segments amounted to 254 million in 2013  252 million  in 2012  and 245 million  in 2011  the previously discussed merger and acquisitionrelated charges that unfavorably impacted corporate overhead totaled 89 million in 2013  77 million in 2012  and 75 million in 2011  corporate overhead excluding merger and acquisitionrelated costs represented 15 17 and 18 of net sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

othernet othernet totaled 2874 million  of expense in 2013  compared to 2998 million of expense in 2012  the decrease was primarily driven by reduced negative impacts of foreign currency losses related to derivatives and lower deal transaction costs partially offset by higher amortization expense from intangible assets associated with the infastech acquisition and other 2013 acquisitions 

othernet amounted to 2998 million  of expense in 2012  compared to 2543 million  of expense in 2011  the increase primarily pertained to higher amortization expense from intangible assets associated with the niscayah acquisition and other 2012 acquisitions defined benefit pension settlements and unfavorable impacts of foreign currency

interest net net interest expense in 2013  was 1476 million  compared to 1341 million  in 2012  and 1139 million  in 2011  the increase in net interest expense in 2013 versus 2012 mainly relates to the incremental interest costs associated with the higher debt levels during 2013 partially offset by higher interest income the increase in net interest expense in 2012 versus 2011 mainly relates to lower interest income stemming from lower cash balances 

income taxes  the companys effective tax rate was 118  in 2013 144  in 2012 and 79  in 2011 the effective tax rate in 2013 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the companys earnings being realized in lowertaxed foreign jurisdictions the acceleration of certain tax credits the recurring benefit of various foreign business integration structures and the reversal of certain foreign and us state uncertain tax position reserves related largely to statute expiration the effective tax rate in 2012 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings and the inclusion of 489 million in benefits from a favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies the effective tax rate in 2011 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the inclusion of 73 million of benefits from a favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies benefits resulting from foreign tax credits and the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings 

business segment results

in the oil  gas business which was driven by a continued rebound in north america onshore operations as well as strong offshore growth performance 

segment profit increased 219 million  and reflects 248 million  of merger and acquisitionrelated charges excluding these charges segment profit was 4610 million  or 149  of net sales in 2013 compared to 4222 million  excluding merger and acquisitionrelated charges of 79 million  or 165  of net sales in 2012 the decrease in the profit rate was driven by higher operating expenses associated with the organic growth initiatives negative impacts from foreign currency and the impact of modestly below line average infastech margins

cdiy as previously discussed working capital turns improved to 80 times at december 28 2013 as compared to 76 times for 2012 which reflects processdriven improvements from sfs operating cash flows in 2013 were also negatively impacted by increases in employee related payments and investments in organic growth initiatives 

in 2012  cash flows from operations were 966 million  a 33 million decrease compared to 999 million million in 2011  cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by merger and acquisitionrelated charges and payments of 357 million and 218 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively after adjusting for the impact of the decrease in these charges and payments cash flows from operations improved in 2012 by a net amount of 106 million due to an increase in earnings operating cash flows reflected a continued focus on working capital resulting in 48 million of inflows in 2012 and 170 million of inflows in 2011 working capital turns improved to 76 times at december 29 2012 as compared to 72 times for 2011 

free cash flow management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide dividends to shareowners as previously discussed operating cash flow was affected by 280 million and 357 million of merger and acquisitionrelated charges and payments in 2013  and 2012 respectively additionally capitalized expenditures included 72 million and 122 million of merger and integration spending in 2013 and 2012 respectively free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the company’s common stock and business acquisitions among other items

credit ratings and liquidity 

the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a as well as its shortterm commercial paper borrowings there have been no changes to any of the ratings during 2013

contractual obligations the following summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 

payments due by period   



  

 

to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities the related amount will be included in the table above however due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the 3109 million of such liabilities at december 28 2013 the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 

aside from debt payments for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal tax obligations and the equity purchase contract fees payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian latin american and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars cross currency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2013 would have been approximately a 29 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact on pretax earnings of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 98 million or approximately 048 per diluted share in 2013 translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pretax earnings by approximately 60 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately 030 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at december 28 2013 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 

overall the company experienced inflation of approximately 53 million 82 million and 236 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively price erosion has also occurred in 2013 and 2012 in addition to inflation with a cumulative unfavorable impact of 136 million the impact of inflation is expected to continue in 2014 with cost and pricing actions being aggressively pursued to offset any adverse impact on operations 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of mda additionally the company has 46 million of liabilities as of december 28 2013 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2013 2012 and 2011 there were 102 million 194 million and 119 million respectively in investment returns on pension plan assets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 101 million in 2014 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan  as detailed in note l employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us core and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 19 million in 2013 259 million in 2012 and 284 million in 2011 the decrease in net esop expense in 2013 is related to the release of 219000 shares of unallocated stock triggered by an additional contribution to the esop which was used by the esop to make an additional payment on the associated loan as more fully discussed in note l employee benefit plans  esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies  management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

i nventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with asc 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 7565 billion  of goodwill 1614 billion  of indefinitelived trade names and 1453 billion  of definitelived intangibles at december 28 2013 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2013 the company adopted asu 201108 “intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” for its 2013 goodwill impairment test asu 201108 permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value further analysis is performed to assess impairment such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the company’s reporting units accordingly the company applied the qualitative assessment for four of its reporting units while performing the twostep quantitative test for the remaining two reporting units based on the results of the annual 2013 impairment testing the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in performing the qualitative assessment the company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as actual and planned financial performance the company also assessed changes in each reporting units fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed as a result of the qualitative assessments performed the company concluded that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed 

with respect to the twostep quantitative tests the company assessed the fair value of the two reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation model which is consistent with previous goodwill impairment tests the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates which ranged from 85 to 90 nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years which ranged from 0 to 6 and a perpetual growth rate of 35 these assumptions contemplated business market and overall economic conditions management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting 

from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rates and perpetual growth rate in each of the reporting units the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated based upon the companys 2013 annual impairment testing analyses including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 

the fair values of indefinitelived trade names were also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used included discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales based on these quantitative impairment tests the company determined that the fair values of the indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

in the event that the company’s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analyses while a useful tool should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 450  and 400  respectively at december 28 2013 

the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 375  and 400  respectively at december 29 2012 as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns the company’s expected rate of return assumption for the united states and international pension plans were 625  and 600  respectively at december 28 2013 the company will use a 650 weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2014 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2014 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 5 million pretax 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 780 million at december 28 2013 a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 91 million at december 28 2013 the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 27 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2013 which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 28 2013 the company had reserves of 184 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 138 million  to 274 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses and capital losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not”   that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers all positive and negative evidence including estimates of future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company is subject to tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence and 40 million in the aggregate per annum the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 105 million and 106 million as of december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 122 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december 28 2013 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the company also establishes a reserve for 

product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 1 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2013  as of december 28 2013  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 31 million and 26 million respectively

major customers 

a significant portion of the company’s cdiy products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers has provided the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss as a result of the company’s diversification strategy sales to us home centers and mass merchants declined from a high of approximately 40 in 2002 to 15 before the black  decker merger in 2012  sales to us home centers and mass merchants were 18 as acquisitions in the various growth platforms convergent and mechanical security engineered fastening infrastructure and healthcare are made in future years the proportion of sales to these valued us and international home center and mass merchant customers is expected to continue to decrease to levels prior to the black  decker merger

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2012 however the two largest customers comprised nearly 16 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 24 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

if customers in the convergent security solutions css business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons the companys attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides 

in times of tough economic condition the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in 2013 and beyond may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company has significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

the company generates revenue outside of the united states and expects it to continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated 

inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the companys operations disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for its products and make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture its products deliver products to customers or to receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum nickel and resin additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the european union eu the risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on the european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2010 a financial crisis emerged in europe triggered by high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign debt in greece ireland italy portugal and spain which created concerns about the ability of these eu “peripheral nations” to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations these conditions impacted financial markets and resulted in high and volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt of many eu nations the financial stress experienced by the peripheral nations has decreased and yields on governmentissued bonds and their associated volatilities have come off their recent highs despite these improving signs and the extraordinary measures taken by the ecb through the european financial stability facility worries about sovereign finances and their potential contagion effect over other economies in the region persist 

risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices among other factors there can be no assurance that the market disruptions in europe including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions will not spread nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or even if provided will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in europe or elsewhere to the extent uncertainty regarding the economic recovery continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer credit factors the companys business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected 

the company generates approximately 27 of its revenues from europe each of the company’s segments generate sales from the european marketplace with the sales activity being somewhat concentrated within france the nordic region germany and the uk while the company believes any downturn in the european marketplace would be offset to some degree by sales growth in emerging markets and relative stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british asian and latin america currencies including the chinese renminbi rmb in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2012 foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted revenues by approximately 270 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately 010 the translation impact will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company has a committed revolving credit agreement expiring in march 2015 supporting borrowings up to 12 billion and a 10 billion 364 day committed credit facility expiring in july 2013 no amounts were outstanding against these facilities at december 29 2012 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

  

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as access to the capital markets 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2012 the company completed seven smaller acquisitions in 2011 the company completed the acquisition of niscayah and nine smaller acquisitions in 2010 along with the merger the company completed the acquisition of crcevans as well as nine smaller acquisitions prior to 2010 the company completed a number of acquisitions including but not limited to gdp sonitrol and xmark in 2008 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of the company’s growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on its ability to 

 failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of certain smaller acquisitions in 2012 the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

expansion of the companys activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures 

the companys growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic sales and acquisitions local business practices in these regions may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to the company when investigating potential acquisitions the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue postcompletion or as a successor to the target where such practices are discovered the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction in assessing the risk the company looks at among other factors the nature of the violation the potential liability including any fines or penalties that might be incurred the ability to avoid minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures due diligence and risk assessment are however imperfect processes and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities should that occur the company may incur fees fines penalties injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the companys earnings 

sequestration or other actions of the us government resulting in significant cuts in us government spending could adversely affect the companys growth initiatives and future results 

the companys growth initiatives call for increased sales to us government customers in the healthcare security and industrial verticals should sequestration take effect or other actions be taken that significantly cut us government spending in those areas the companys growth initiatives and future results may be adversely impacted 

a downturn in the us economy could adversely affect the companys business 

almost 50 of the companys 2012 annual revenues were from the united states the company is targeting a 23 increase in organic growth in 2013 and 46 organic growth over the long term some of this growth will come from the us market a downturn in the us economy would make it more difficult for the company to attain these growth objectives and could adversely impact results 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company as income tax expense future tax law changes may materially increase the companys prospective income tax expense 

pursuant to the rules of asc 740 accounting for income taxes income tax payments made may differ from the total income tax expense recorded primarily due to deferred taxes and income tax reserves the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the companys worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the companys income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the companys worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the merger and other acquisitions the company has 70 billion of goodwill 16 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 13 billion of definitelived intangible assets at december 29 2012 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2012 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 107 million and it expects to contribute 80 million to its defined benefit plans in 2013 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at december 29 2012 was 1836 billion 

legal or technological hurdles associated with the expansion of use of rfid and rtls technologies in company products could adversely affect the companys growth initiatives and long term results 

the companys growth initiatives call for expansions of use of rfid and rtls technologies both geographically and through incorporation of these technologies into new products in connection with these activities the company may encounter both technological difficulties and legal impediments including but not limited to design requirements ownership claims and licensing requirements that could delay or prevent the use of these technologies in certain products andor in certain geographies any such impediments could adversely impact the companys plans for growth and future results

terminology the terms “organic” and “core” are utilized to describe results aside from the impact of acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods the company has included information as if the black  decker merger had occurred on january 3 2010 for the year ended january 1 2011 “pro forma” information this “pro forma” analysis is provided to aid understanding of the 2011 and 2010 trends since the merger occurred march 12 2010 

net sales net sales were 10191 billion  in 2012  up 8  compared to 9436 billion  in 2011  organic sales volume provided a 2 increase in net sales and the impact of acquisitions provided an additional 8 increase while unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of 2 to net sales the cdiy segment grew 5 organically in comparison to 2011 which was driven by successful new products and market share gains under the d e walt and black  decker brands in the 

industrial segment organic sales grew 1 relative to 2011 due to strong organic growth in the engineered fastening business which was partially offset by iar exposure to weakening european markets and declines in the infrastructure business due to lagging results in the onshore pipeline business organic net sales in the security segment declined 4 compared to 2011 which was attributable to a difficult european market impacting the css business and weakness within the mas business in the us tied to slow commercial construction as well as soft national account spending 

net sales were 9436 billion in 2011  as compared to 7497 billion  in 2010  a 26  increase organic sales volume provided a 6 increase in net sales the impact of a full year of results from the black  decker merger provided an 10 increase to sales the impact of other acquisitions primarily niscayah and crcevans provided an additional 8 increase in net sales while the favorable effects of foreign currency translations in all regions but most significantly in europe and asia contributed an additional 2 to net sales the primary drivers of the organic volume growth continue to be new product introductions resulting in market share gains and continued high growth rates in emerging markets inclusive of continued revenue synergy realizations from the black  decker merger organic sales volume increased 5 in cdiy 10 in industrial and 2 in security cdiys organic volume growth was primarily driven by strength in professional power tools via new product introductions and increased promotional activity on older generation products this growth was offset by lower sales volume in hand tools and fastening largely due to soft end markets in the retail channels and lower sales of outdoor products in the first half of the year due to inclement weather in north america organic sales volume growth in the industrial segment was strong in each major business component and in most geographic regions due primarily to the success of new products and increased market share gains within the security segment limited overall organic sales growth reflects 6 organic sales growth from healthcare solutions due to strong sales in the patient security and radio frequency identification “rfid”enabled systems offset by lower css installation revenues on a pro forma basis net sales increased 14 with acquisitions accounting for 7 of the increase organic growth providing 5 of the increase and 2 reflecting the benefit of foreign currency translation

the company reported gross profit of 3468 billion  or 368  of net sales in 2011  compared to 2690 billion  or 359  of net sales in 2010  the inclusion of a full year of black  decker as well as acquisition activity specifically niscayah and crcevans were the main drivers behind the overall increase in gross profit further gross profit was negatively impacted by 21 million of merger and acquisitionrelated charges in 2011 related largely to facility closures and 146 million in 2010   pertaining to the inventory stepup amortization from the initial turn of black  decker and crcevans inventories and facility closure costs the gross profit rates excluding these charges were 370 in 2011 as compared to 378 of net sales in 2010 the lower gross profit margin rate in 2011 excluding merger and acquisitionrelated charges is primarily due to the effect of commodity inflation and cdiy promotional discounting on older generation products all of which combined outweighed the positive impacts of organic volumerelated increases price increases in response to commodity inflation cost synergies and productivity initiatives 

sga expense selling general and administrative expenses inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts “sga” were 2520 billion  or 247  of net sales in 2012  as compared 2381 billion  or 252  of net sales in 2011  within sga merger and acquisitionrelated compensation costs and integrationrelated expenses totaled 1384 million and 983 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively excluding these charges sga was 234 of net sales in 2012 compared to 242 of net sales in 2011 the favorable sga rate is mainly driven by sales volume leverage cost synergies and continued cost containment efforts

distribution center costs ie warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs are classified within sga this classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales due to diversity in practice to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies the company’s gross margins may not be comparable such distribution costs classified in sga amounted to 205 million in 2012 and 2011 and 188 million in 

2010  the increase from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of black  decker results as well as higher sales volume 

corporate overhead  the corporate overhead element of sga and gross profit which is not allocated to the business segments amounted to 252 million in 2012  and 245 million  in 2011  and 2010  the previously discussed merger and acquisitionrelated charges that unfavorably impacted corporate overhead totaled 77 million in 2012  75 million in 2011  and 81 million in 2010  corporate overhead excluding merger and acquisitionrelated costs represented 17 18 and 22 of net sales in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

othernet othernet totaled 3019 million  of expense in 2012  compared to 2557 million million of expense in 2011  the increase primarily pertains to higher amortization expense from intangible assets associated with the niscayah acquisition and other 2012 acquisitions defined benefit pension settlements and unfavorable impacts of foreign currency

income taxes  the companys effective tax rate was 149 in 2012 77 in 2011 and 107 in 2010 the effective tax rate in 2012 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings and the inclusion of 489 million in benefits from a favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies the effective tax rate in 2011 differed from the us statutory rate primarily due to the inclusion of 73 million of benefits from a favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies benefits resulting from foreign tax credits and the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings the effective rate differed from the us statutory rate in 2010 primarily due to the inclusion of approximately 36 million of benefits attributable to the favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies partially offset by various nondeductible transaction costs and other restructuring costs associated with the merger

credit ratings and liquidity 

the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a as well as its shortterm commercial paper borrowings there have been no changes to any of the ratings during 2012 

failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to access committed credit facilities

internationally including acquisitions and longterm financial objectives no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of these undistributed foreign earnings however should management determine at a later point to repatriate additional foreign earnings the company would be required to accrue and pay taxes at that time 

contractual obligations the following summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 

payments due by period   



  

 

to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities the related amount will be included in the table above however due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the 2401 million of such liabilities at december 29 2012 the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 

aside from debt payments for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal tax obligations and the equity purchase contract fees payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian latin american and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars cross currency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2012 would have been approximately a 34 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 89 million or 054 per diluted share the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was approximately 010 unfavorable in 2012 017 favorable in 2011 and 014 favorable in 2010 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at december 29 2012 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects the company experienced inflation primarily commodity related of approximately 82 million 236 million and 70 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively price erosion has also occurred in 2012 and 2011 in addition to inflation with a cumulative unfavorable impact of 247 million the impact of inflation is expected to continue in 2013 with cost and pricing actions being aggressively pursued to offset any adverse impact on operations 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of mda additionally the company has 40 million of liabilities as of december 29 2012 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse 

changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2012 2011 and 2010 there were 194 million 119 million and 138 million respectively in investment returns on pension plan assets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 80 million in 2013 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings

employee stock ownership plan  as detailed in note l employee benefit plans the company has an esop under which the ongoing us cornerstone and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 259 million in 2012 284 million in 2011 and 34 million in 2010 the esop expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the merger of the black  decker us defined contribution plan into the esop in 2011 esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates —  preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 7021 billion of goodwill 1608 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 1327 billion of definitelived intangibles at december 29 2012 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years these assumptions contemplate business market and overall economic conditions the fair value of indefinitelived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used include discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2012 based on this testing the company determined that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived trade names exceeded their respective carrying values the discount rates used in testing goodwill ranged from 95 to 14 the near term growth rates and perpetual growth rates which varied for each reporting unit ranged from approximately 7 to 11 and 2 to 4 respectively management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate in all reporting units the discount rate was decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rates were decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated based upon the company’s 2012 annual impairment testing analysis including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 

in the event that the company’s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analysis while a useful tool should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 375 and 400 respectively at december 29 2012 

the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 425 and 500 respectively at december 31 2011 as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns for 2012 net periodic benefit cost the company’s expected rate of return assumption was 625 for both united states and international plans the company will use a 600 weightedaverage expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2013 net periodic benefit cost a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2013 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 4 million pretax 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive 

income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 850 million at december 29 2012 a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 99 million at december 29 2012 the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 45 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2012 which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 29 2012 the company had reserves of 188 million  for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 141 million  to 283 million  which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes  income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers all positive and negative evidence including estimates of future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company is subject to tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the companys unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence and 48 million in the aggregate per annum the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 106 million and 105 million as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 124 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december 29 2012 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 3 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2012  as of december 29 2012  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 31 million and 27 million respectively

a significant portion of the company’s cdiy and industrial products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers has provided the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss as a result of the company’s diversification strategy sales to us home centers and mass merchants declined from a high of approximately 40 in 2002 to 15 before the merger in 2011 sales to us home centers and mass merchants were 18 as acquisitions in the various growth platforms electronic and mechanical security engineered fastening infrastructure and healthcare solutions are made in future years the proportion of sales to these valued us and international home center and mass merchant customers is expected to continue to decrease to premerger levels 

working capital 

the company continues to practice the operating disciplines encompassed by the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” sfs has five primary elements that work in concert sales and operations planning operational lean complexity reduction global supply management and ordertocash excellence the company develops 

  

standardized business processes and system platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability sfs is instrumental in the reduction of working capital evidenced by the improvement in working capital turns for legacy stanley from 46 in 2003 to 86 at the end of 2009 directly preceding the merger closing out 2010 once blended with the legacy black  decker working capital turns of 47 working capital turns for the combined company were 57 the opportunity to deploy sfs across the entire combined enterprise and increase turns represented a significant opportunity to generate incremental free cash flow through the initial integration of the legacy black  decker businesses and the ongoing improvement of the legacy stanley businesses with the sfs model working capital turns experienced a 23 improvement from the end of 2010 to 70 at the end of 2011 excluding the impact of niscayah in 2012 and beyond the company plans to further leverage sfs to generate ongoing improvements both in the existing business and future acquisitions in working capital turns cycle times complexity reduction and customer service levels 

raw materials 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel the company also purchases resins batteries motors and electronic components to use in manufacturing and assembly operations the raw materials required are procured globally and available from multiple sources at competitive prices the company employs a supplier risk mitigation strategy in order to identify and address any potential supply disruption associated with commodities components finished goods and critical services the company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or energy used in its production processes 

backlog 

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the company’s cdiy and industrial segment businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 4 2012 the company had approximately 770 million in unfilled orders which mainly relate to the company’s security segment substantially all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year as of february 5 2011 and february 6 2010 unfilled orders amounted to 705 million and 320 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

no business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments the company owns numerous patents none of which individually is material to the company’s operations as a whole these patents expire at various times over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the company’s operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in duration but generally run from one to 40 years 

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide in the cdiy segment the stanley ®  fatmax ®  dewalt ®  black  decker ®  bostitch ®  bailey ®  powerlock ®  tape rule case design ®  dustbuster ®  portercable ®  and workmate ® of trademarks are material the stanley ®  best ®  blick tm  hsm ®  national ®  sargent  greenleaf ®  sg ® sonitrol ®  niscayah ®  xmark ®  kwikset ®  weiser ®  and baldwin ® trademarks are material to the security segment the dewalt ®  crc ®  labounty ®  mac ®  mac tools ®  proto ®  vidmar ®  facom ®  usag ®  and emhart teknologies tm trademarks are material to the industrial segment the terms of these trademarks typically vary from 10 to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms 

environmental regulations 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

  

in the normal course of business the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims in addition the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of december 31 2011 and january 1 2011 the company had reserves of 165 million and 173 million respectively for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable of the 2011 amount 12 million is classified as current and 153 million as longterm which is expected to be paid over the estimated remediation period the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 140 million to 355 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with policy 

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity additional information regarding environmental matters is available in note s contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

employees 

at december 31 2011 the company had approximately 44700 employees 16600 of whom are employed in the us approximately 800 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 21 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the company’s hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the company’s labor agreements in the us expire in 2012 2013 and 2014 there have been no significant interruptions of the company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2011 however the two largest customers comprised nearly 16 of net sales with us and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprised approximately 23 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

if customers in our electronic security solutions business are dissatisfied with our services and switch to competitive services or disconnect for other reasons our attrition rates may increase in periods of increasing attrition rates recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services we provide 

in times of tough economic condition the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new 

  

products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in 2012 may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

  

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

we have significant operations outside of the united states which are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states 

we generate revenue outside of the united states and expect it to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue business operations outside of the united states are subject to political economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

  

in addition the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of our suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for our products and make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our products deliver products to customers or to receive materials from suppliers 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum nickel and resin additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products changes in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results 

  

uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the european union eu the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on the european economy could have a significant adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in 2010 a financial crisis emerged in europe triggered by high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign debt in greece ireland italy portugal and spain which created concerns about the ability of these eu “peripheral nations” to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations these conditions impacted financial markets and resulted in high and volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt of many eu nations certain european nations continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress and yields on governmentissued bonds in greece ireland italy portugal and spain have risen and remain volatile despite assistance packages to greece ireland and portugal the creation of a joint euimf european financial stability facility in may 2010 and a recently announced plan to expand financial assistance to greece uncertainty over the outcome of the eu governments’ financial support programs and worries about sovereign finances persist market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of european banks and insurers to the eu peripheral nations has resulted in a widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for some european financial institutions 

risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices among other factors there can be no assurance that the market disruptions in europe including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions will not spread nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or even if provided will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in europe or elsewhere to the extent uncertainty regarding the economic recovery continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer credit factors our business and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected 

the company generates approximately 28 of its revenues from europe which increases to 31 on a proforma basis with the full year impact of the niscayah acquisition each of the company’s segments generate sales from the european marketplace with the sales activity being somewhat concentrated within france the nordic region germany and the uk while the company believes any downturn in the european marketplace would be offset to some degree by sales growth in emerging markets and stability in north america the company’s future growth profitability and financial liquidity could be affected in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi rmb in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2011 foreign currency translation positively impacted revenues by approximately 200 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately 017 the translation impact will vary over time and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company has a committed revolving credit agreement expiring in march 2015 supporting borrowings up to 12 billion further in connection with the niscayah acquisition the company entered into a revolving credit agreement in july 2011 that will expire in july 2012 this facility had 750 million capacity at december 2011 no amounts were outstanding against either facility at december 31 2011 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 

  

  

   

 future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts options and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

the company’s growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products and services andor customer insolvencies 

in addition the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings the company’s ability to access the credit markets and the cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing as well as access to the capital markets 

the failure to successfully continue to integrate the businesses of stanley and black  decker in the expected time frame could adversely affect the company’s future results 

the success of the merger continues to depend in large part on the ability of the company to realize the anticipated benefits including cost savings from combining the businesses of stanley and black  decker to realize these anticipated benefits the businesses of stanley and black  decker must be successfully integrated this integration is complex and timeconsuming the failure to integrate successfully and to successfully manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger 

  

potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

 

  

  

  

 additionally the company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial integrationrelated expenses resulting from the merger and other acquisitions the company anticipates incurring 242 million of such charges in 2012 while management believes this estimate is reasonable the amount of future integration expense is not certain and could result in the company taking significant additional charges against earnings in future periods 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

in 2011 the company completed the acquisition of niscayah and nine smaller acquisitions in 2010 along with the merger the company completed the acquisition of crcevans as well as nine smaller acquisitions prior to 2010 the company completed a number of acquisitions including but not limited to gdp sonitrol and xmark in 2008 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 

acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the success of the company’s growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on its ability to 

 

  

  

   

  

 failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of niscayah crcevans and certain other smaller acquisitions the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company future tax law changes may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes effective also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

  

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s products could be recalled 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of the merger and other acquisitions the company has 69 billion of goodwill 16 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 15 billion of definitelived intangible assets at december 31 2011 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities money market instruments and insurance contracts the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2011 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 131 million and it expects to contribute 110 million to its defined benefit plans in 2012 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at december 31 2011 was 1789 billion

net sales net sales were 10376 billion in 2011 as compared to 8344 billion in 2010 a 24 increase organic sales volume provided a 5 increase in net sales the impact of a full year of results from the merger provided an 11 increase to sales the impact of other acquisitions primarily niscayah and crcevans provided an additional 7 increase in net sales while the favorable effects of foreign currency translation in all regions but most significantly in europe and asia contributed an additional 1 to net sales the primary drivers of the organic volume growth continues to be new product introductions resulting in market share gains and continued high growth rates in emerging markets inclusive of continued revenue synergy realizations from the merger on a geographic basis 2011 organic sales increased 5 in the americas 25 in latin america 3 in europe and 6 in asia excluding the engineered fastening business in japan and china where it has experienced the continued effects of the first quarter 2011 japanese earthquake and tsunami organic sales in asia were up 25 as compared to full year 2010 on a pro forma basis net sales increased 12 with acquisitions accounting for 6 of the increase organic growth providing 4 of the increase and 2 reflecting the benefit of foreign currency translation 

organic sales volume increased 4 in cdiy 10 in industrial and 1 in security cdiy’s organic volume growth was primarily driven by strength in professional power tools via new product introductions and increased promotional activity on older generation products this growth was offset by lower sales volume in hand tools and fastening largely due to soft end markets in the retail channels the ongoing impact of lower volume from pfister resulting from the loss of business at a major customer in the first quarter of 2011 and lower sales of outdoor products in the first half of the year due to inclement weather in north america organic sales volume growth in the industrial segment was strong in each major business component and in most geographic regions due primarily to the success of new products and increased market share gains within the security segment limited overall organic sales growth reflects 6 organic sales growth from heathcare solutions due to strong sales in the patient security and radio frequency identification “rfid”enabled systems offset by lower electronic security solutions installation revenues and delays in the remodeling expenditures at a large mechanical access solutions customer 

net sales were 8344 billion in 2010 as compared to 3683 billion in 2009 a 127 increase the merger provided a 115 increase to sales along with 7 from other acquisitions primarily ssds and crcevans organic unit volume increased 5 while price and currency were both flat compared to the prior year organic sales growth was driven by the successful launch of various new products which generally have been well received by customers and overall improvement in end market demand especially in industrial and emerging markets by segment legacy stanley unit volume increased 3 in cdiy decreased 3 in security which was negatively impacted by the continued weakness in us commercial construction markets along with a large us retailer’s inventory correction and increased 25 in industrial the industrial segment benefited from strong end user demand market share gain and global customer restocking in certain distribution channels which subsided by the fourth quarter on a geographic basis legacy stanley unit volume sales increased 3 in the americas 17 in latin america 6 in europe and 12 in the asian region on a pro forma basis the legacy black  decker business achieved strong unit volume growth of 11 reflecting positive end market demand including robust sales growth in emerging markets along with strong new product performance particularly the 12volt lithium ion power tools 

gross profit the company reported gross profit of 3794 billion or 366 of net sales in 2011 compared to 2935 billion or 352 of net sales in 2010 the inclusion of a full year of black  decker as well as acquisition activity specifically niscayah and crcevans were the main drivers behind the overall increase in gross profit further gross profit was negatively impacted by 37 million of merger and acquisitionrelated 

  

charges in 2011 related largely to facility closures and 195 million in 2010 pertaining to the inventory stepup amortization from the initial turn of black  decker and crcevan’s inventories and facility closure costs the gross profit rates excluding these charges were 369 in 2011 as compared to 375 of net sales in 2010 the lower gross profit margin rate in 2011 excluding merger and acquisitionrelated charges is primarily due to the effect of commodity inflation and cdiy promotional discounting on older generation products all of which combined outweighed the positive impacts of organic volumerelated increases price increases in response to commodity inflation cost synergies and productivity initiatives 

the company reported gross profit of 2935 billion or 352 of net sales in 2010 compared to 1492 billion or 405 of net sales in 2009 the addition of black  decker and acquisition activity were the main drivers to the overall increase in gross profit gross profit in 2010 was negatively impacted by 195 million of merger and acquisitionrelated charges as previously discussed aside from merger and acquisitionrelated charges gross profit increased to 3130 billion or 375 of net sales in 2010 this performance was driven by sales volume leverage benefits from prior year restructuring actions and the continued execution of productivity initiatives partially offset by unfavorable commodity inflation 

sga expense selling general and administrative expenses inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts “sga” were 2552 billion or 246 of net sales in 2011 as compared 2153 billion or 258 of net sales in 2010 merger and acquisitionrelated charges totaled 99 million in 2011 and 82 million in 2010 for certain executive and mergerrelated compensation costs and integrationrelated consulting fees excluding merger and acquisitionrelated charges sga was 236 of net sales in 2011 compared with 248 of net sales in the prior year the favorable sga rate primarily reflects sales volume leverage and cost synergies partially offset by the impact of acquisitions on a pro forma basis including merger and acquisitionrelated charges sga expense was 2373 billion or 256 of net sales in 2010 

sga expenses were 2153 billion or 258 of net sales in 2010 as compared with 1016 billion or 276 of net sales in 2009 merger and acquisitionrelated charges totaled 82 million in 2010 and 5 million in 2009 for certain executive and mergerrelated compensation costs and integrationrelated consulting fees black  decker and acquisitions contributed an additional 985 million of operating sga the remaining increase in sga primarily relates to corporate overhead discussed below investments to fund future growth and the reinstatement of certain us retirement benefits that were temporarily suspended in 2009 as part of cost saving measures excluding merger and acquisitionrelated charges sga for 2010 was 2071 billion or 248 of net sales the improvement in the sga rate as a percentage of sales mainly reflects sales volume leverage savings from restructuring actions and cost synergies along with the other aforementioned factors 

distribution center costs ie warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs are classified within sga this classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales due to diversity in practice to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies the company’s gross margins may not be comparable such distribution costs classified in sga amounted to 240 million 197 million and 101 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of black  decker results in the 2011 period as well as higher sales volume in the current year 

corporate overhead the corporate overhead element of sga and gross profit which is not allocated to the business segments amounted to 245 million in 2011 and 2010 and 71 million in 2009 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full nine months of black  decker in 2010 the previously discussed merger and acquisitionrelated charges that unfavorably impacted corporate overhead totaled 75 million in 2011 81 million in 2010 and 5 million in 2009 corporate overhead excluding merger and acquisitionrelated costs represented 16 20 and 18 of net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

othernet othernet expense totaled 278 million of expense in 2011 compared to 199 million of expense in 2010 the increase primarily pertains to higher amortization expense from intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions 14 million of incremental merger and acquisitionrelated charges and the impact of defined benefit plan curtailment gains of 20 million in 2010 

othernet amounted to 199 million of expense in 2010 compared to 138 million of expense in 2009 the increase is primarily related to higher intangible asset amortization expense and 37 million of merger and acquisitionrelated charges inclusive of 20 million of defined benefit plan curtailment gains 

gain on debt extinguishment in may 2009 the company repurchased 103 million of its junior subordinated debt securities for 59 million in cash and recognized a 44 million pretax gain on extinguishment 

interest net net interest expense in 2011 was 113 million compared to 101 in 2010 and 61 million in 2009 the increase in net interest expense mainly relates to the incremental interest costs associated with new debt issuances in the second half of 2010 partially offset by higher interest income the increase in 2010 versus 2009 relates to higher longterm borrowing levels resulting primarily from the 18 billion in debt acquired in connection with the merger 

income taxes the company’s effective tax rate was 11 in 2011 compared to 16 in 2010 and 19 in 2009 the low tax rate in 2011 can be largely attributable to the inclusion of 73 million of benefits from a favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies benefits resulting from foreign tax credits and the distribution of domestic and foreign earnings the effective tax rate differed from the statutory tax rates in 2010 primarily due to various nondeductible transaction costs and other restructuring costs associated with the merger which were principally offset by the inclusion of 36 million of benefits attributable to the favorable settlement of certain tax contingencies the lower effective tax rate versus statutory tax rates in 2009 primarily relates to benefits realized upon resolution of certain tax audits the effective tax rate may vary in future periods based upon changes in domestic and foreign earnings changes in the tax law in the jurisdictions the company operates as well as other factors

liquidity sources and uses of capital the company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities 

operating activities cash flow from operations was 999 million in 2011 compared to 739 million in 2010 representing a 260 million increase cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by merger and acquisitionrelated charges and payments of 218 million and 382 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively after adjusting for the impact of the decrease in merger and acquisitionrelated charges and payments cash flows from operations improved in 2011 by a net amount of 312 million due to increases in earnings cash flow from operations reflects a continued focus on working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable resulting in 134 million of inflows in 2011 and 135 million of inflows in 2010 working capital turns improved to 70 times excluding niscayah at december 31 2011 as compared to 57 times for 2010 which reflects improvements in both days outstanding of accounts receivable and accounts payable while inventory turns remained consistent the improvement in overall working capital turns reflects the processdriven improvements from sfs sfs principles continue to be deployed across all businesses and regions to improve working capital efficiency over time 

in 2010 cash flow from operations was 739 million a 202 million increase compared to 537 million in 2009 cash flows from operations improved in 2010 primarily due to an increase in various noncash expenses associated with the merger and the other 2010 acquisitions such expenses include among other items 174 million of inventory stepup amortization a 41 million increase in intangible asset amortization and a 108 million increase in other depreciation and amortization inflows from working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable were 135 million in 2010 compared with inflows of 226 million in 2009 the change from 2009 is driven by higher receivables and inventory associated with improved 2010 sales volume working capital turns improved to 57 times at january 1 2011 as compared to 52 times for 2009 pro forma with black  decker due to improvements in days outstanding accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable cash flow from operations in 2010 was also negatively impacted by approximately 382 million in payments for merger and acquisitionrelated items including 182 million in discretionary cash contributions to improve the funded status of legacy black  decker pension plans

cash payments for dividends were 276 million 202 million and 104 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in cash dividends in 2011 was primarily attributable to the increase in dividends per common share to 041 per share as announced in february 2011 which represents the 44 th consecutive year of dividend increases the increase in 2010 cash dividend payments versus 2009 is due to higher shares outstanding stemming from the merger

credit ratings and liquidity 

the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a as well as its shortterm commercial paper borrowings there have been no changes to any of the ratings during 2011 

failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to access committed credit facilities in march 2011 the company entered into a new four year 12 billion committed credit facility the “credit agreement” in connection with entering into the credit agreement the company terminated the existing 8000 million amended and restated credit agreement additionally the 7000 million 364day credit agreement dated as of march 12 2010 expired in accordance with its terms on march 11 2011 borrowings under the credit agreement may include us dollars up to the 12 billion commitment or in euro or pounds sterling subject to a foreign currency sublimit of 4000 million and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing repayments must be made on march 11 2015 or upon an earlier termination date of the credit agreement at the election of the company the company has not drawn on the commitments provided by the credit agreement in july 2011 in connection with the niscayah acquisition the company entered into a 125 billion 364 day credit facility “facility” borrowings under the facility may include us dollars or euros up to the commitment and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing the facility decreased to 750 million as per the terms of the agreement in december 2011 where it will remain until it expires in july 2012 or upon an earlier termination date at the election of the company the company has not drawn on the commitments provided by the facility these credit facilities are designated to be liquidity backstops for the company’s commercial paper program finally in august 2011 the company increased its commercial paper program from 15 billion to 20 billion

contractual obligations the following summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity 

payments due by period 

 

  

      to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities the related amount will be included in the table above however due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the 240 million of such liabilities at december 31 2011 the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 

while there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of debt principal tax obligations the forward stock purchase contract and the equity purchase contract fees payment of the other contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options collars cross currency swaps and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2011 would have been approximately a 69 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause a “transactional” impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 101 million or 059 per diluted share the effect of foreign currency translation on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was approximately 017 favorable in 2011 014 favorable in 2010 and 004 unfavorable in 2009 

  

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at december 31 2011 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects the company experienced inflation primarily commodity related of approximately 236 million and 70 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively while it experienced mild deflation in 2009 price erosion has also occurred in 2011 and 2010 in addition to inflation with the cumulative unfavorable impact exceeding 320 million the impact of inflation is expected to continue in 2012 with cost and pricing actions being aggressively pursued to offset any adverse impact on operations 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of mda additionally the company has 30 million of liabilities as of december 31 2011 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2011 2010 and 2009 there were 119 million 138 million and 48 million in investment returns on pension plan assets respectively the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 110 million in 2012 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

  

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an esop under which the ongoing us cornerstone and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors the company’s net esop activity resulted in expense of 284 million in 2011 expense of 34 million in 2010 and income of 80 million in 2009 the esop expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the merger of black  decker us defined contribution plan into the esop in 2011 the esop income in 2009 stems from the suspension of the cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the 401k match as a percentage of employee contributions as part of cost saving actions esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

critical accounting estimates — preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

  

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 6920 billion of goodwill 1633 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 1484 billion of definitelived intangibles at december 31 2011 

management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years these assumptions contemplate business market and overall economic conditions the fair value of indefinitelived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used include discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2011 based on this testing the company determined that the fair value of its reporting units and indefinitelived trade names exceeded their carrying values the discount rates used in testing goodwill ranged from 85 to 115 the near term growth rates and perpetual growth rates which varied for each reporting unit ranged from approximately 3 to 10 and 2 to 4 respectively management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate in all reporting units the discount rate was decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rates were decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated based upon the company’s 2011 annual impairment testing analysis including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 

in the event that the company’s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analysis while a useful tool should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 425 and 50 respectively at december 31 2011 

  

the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for both the united states and international pension plans was 525 at january 1 2011 as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns for 2011 net periodic benefit cost the company’s expected rate of return assumption was 70 for both united states and international plans the company will use a 625 expected rate of return assumption for 2012 net periodic benefit cost reflecting a relatively higher proportion of fixed income plan assets a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2012 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 4 million pretax 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 758 million at december 31 2011 a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 87 million at december 31 2011 the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans as of december 31 2011 83 of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 32 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2011 which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of december 31 2011 the company had reserves of 165 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 140 million to 355 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes — income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

  

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company considers all positive and negative evidence including estimates of future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the reliability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company is subject to tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence and 49 million in the aggregate per annum the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 112 million and 106 million as of december 31 2011 and january 1 2011 respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 129 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december 31 2011 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the 

  

ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 6 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2011 as of december 31 2011 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 36 million and 32 million respectively

1a general development of business 

 

i general the stanley works “stanley” was founded in 1843 by frederick t stanley and incorporated in 1852 stanley is a diversified global provider of hand tools mechanical access solutions and electronic security solutions stanley ® is a brand recognized around the world for quality and value 

 

on march 12 2010 stanley completed a merger the “merger” with the black  decker corporation “black  decker” black  decker which was incorporated in maryland in 1910 is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of power tools and accessories hardware and home improvement products and technologybased engineered fastening systems black  decker enjoys worldwide recognition of its strong brand names and a superior reputation for quality design innovation and value in connection with the merger stanley changed its name to stanley black  decker inc throughout this document references to the “company” refer to stanley black  decker inc the company’s consolidated financial statements include black  decker’s results of operations and cash flows from march 13 2010 

 

as detailed in note e merger and acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 black  decker stockholders received 1275 shares of stanley common stock for each share of black  decker common stock outstanding as of the merger date outstanding black  decker equity awards primarily stock options were similarly exchanged for stanley equity awards after the exchange was completed premerger stanley shareowners retained ownership of 505 of the newly combined company based on the 5786 closing price of stanley common stock on march 12 2010 the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred to consummate the merger was 4657 billion 

 

management believes the merger is a transformative event bringing together two highly complementary companies with iconic brands rich histories and common distribution channels yet with minimal product overlap the merger also enables a global offering in hand and power tools as well as hardware thus enhancing the company’s value proposition to customers management believes the value unlocked by the anticipated 425 million in cost synergies expected to be achieved by the end of 2012 will help fuel future growth and facilitate global cost leadership this updated cost synergy estimate represents a 75 million increase from the original 350 million by march 2013 at the time of the merger the cost synergy drivers are business unit and regional consolidation management sales force and shared services integration 145 million purchasing materials freight etc 100 million corporate overhead 95 million and manufacturing and distribution facility consolidation 85 million the company is ahead of plan on the integration of the two companies and realized 135 million of the cost synergies in 2010 which is 45 million more than originally forecasted for the nine month period that followed the merger an additional 165 million of cost synergies are anticipated in 2011 and an incremental 125 million in 2012 to achieve the total cumulative 425 million in cost synergies in 2012 of the 330 million in cost synergies pertaining to operations all but the 95 million of corporate overhead the benefit by segment is estimated to be 70 in cdiy 20 in security mechanical access solutions and 10 in industrial management estimates there will be an additional 200 million in total costs incurred over the next two years to achieve these synergies from the merger 

 

additionally it is projected that revenue synergies from the merger will be in the range of 300 million to 400 million by 2013 which implies a benefit of 035 — 050 of earnings per diluted share revenue synergies are expected to add an incremental 50 basis points approximately 50 million to 2011 revenue growth and have a modest earnings impact with remaining revenue synergies to be achieved in 2012 and 2013 the anticipated revenue synergies will come from geographic expansion into latin america and other emerging markets leveraging preexisting infrastructure 30 channel and crossselling of existing products such as the sale of power tools through the company’s industrial and automotive repair distributors 30 brand expansion ie utilizing the array of powerful brands in different product categories and channels and 

expanding across the globe as exemplified by the recent introduction of dewalt hand tools in certain channels 30 and joint new product development which entails leveraging development expertise from both legacy companies to pursue new product opportunities 10 the cdiy segment is expected to realize approximately twothirds of the revenue synergies and the remainder will be split evenly in the industrial and security segments in 2011 the company intends to increase capital expenditures to 25 — 28 of revenues partially as a result of infrastructure improvements to foster attainment of the revenue synergies in 2012 and beyond the capital expenditure ratio is expected to return to more historical levels 20 — 25 of revenues in 2012

customers 

 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers has provided the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss as a result of the company’s diversification strategy legacy stanley sales to us home centers and mass merchants declined from a high of approximately 40 in 2002 to 14 in 2010 on a proforma combined basis as if combined the entire year stanley and black  decker 2010 sales to us home centers and mass merchants were approximately 31 including nearly 21 of sales to the combined company’s two largest customers as acquisitions in the various growth platforms electronicconvergent security mechanical security engineered fastening infrastructure solutions and healthcare solutions are made in future years the proportion of sales to these valued us home center and mass merchant customers is expected to decrease

backlog 

 

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the company’s cdiy and industrial segment businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 5 2011 the company had approximately 705 million in unfilled orders substantially all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year as of february 6 2010 and february 2 2009 unfilled orders amounted to 320 million and 348 million respectively

environmental regulations 

 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

 

the environmental protection agency “epa” has provided an affiliate of black  decker a “notice of potential liability” related to environmental contamination found at the centredale manor restoration project superfund site located in north providence rhode island the epa has discovered a variety of contaminants at the site including but not limited to dioxins polychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides the epa alleged that an affiliate of black  decker is liable for site cleanup costs under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” as a successor to the liability of metroatlantic inc a former operator at the site and demanded reimbursement of the epa’s costs related to this site the epa released a draft feasibility study report in may 2010 which identified and evaluated possible remedial alternatives for the site the estimated remediation costs related to this centredale site including the epa’s past costs as well as costs of additional investigation remediation and related costs such as the epa’s oversight costs less escrowed funds contributed by primary potentially responsible parties prps who have reached settlement agreements with the epa which the company considers to be probable and reasonably estimable range from approximately 683 million to 2128 million with no amount within that range representing a more likely outcome until such time as the epa completes its remedy selection process for the site the company’s reserve for this environmental remediation matter of 683 million reflects the fact that the epa considers metroatlantic inc to be a primary source of contamination at the site the company has determined that it is likely to contest the epa’s claims with respect to this site further to the extent that the company agrees to perform or finance additional remedial activities at this site it intends to seek participation or contribution from additional prps and insurance carriers as the specific nature of the environmental remediation activities that may be mandated by the epa at this site have not yet been determined the ultimate remedial costs associated with the site may vary from the amount accrued by the company at january 1 2011 

 

the epa and the santa ana regional water quality control board have each initiated administrative proceedings against black  decker and certain of its current or former affiliates alleging that black  decker and numerous other defendants are responsible to investigate and remediate alleged groundwater contamination in and adjacent to a 160acre property located in rialto california the cities of colton and rialto as well as goodrich corporation also initiated lawsuits against black  decker and certain of its former or current affiliates in the federal district court for california central district alleging similar claims that black  decker is liable under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act and state law for the discharge or release of hazardous substances into the environment and the contamination caused by those alleged releases the city of colton also has a companion case in california state court which is currently stayed for all purposes certain defendants in that case have crossclaims against other defendants and have 

asserted claims against the state of california the administrative proceedings and the lawsuits generally allege that west coast loading corporation “wclc” a defunct company that operated in rialto between 1952 and 1957 and an as yet undefined number of other defendants are responsible for the release of perchlorate and solvents into the groundwater basin and that black  decker and certain of its current or former affiliates are liable as a “successor” of wclc the company believes that neither the facts nor the law support an allegation that black  decker is responsible for the contamination and is vigorously contesting these claims 

 

in addition the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation also the company along with many other companies has been named as a prp in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including 36 active superfund sites current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the company’s volumetric contribution at these sites 

 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 the company had reserves of 1730 million and 297 million respectively for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable of the 2010 amount 259 million is classified as current and 1471 million as longterm which is expected to be paid over the estimated remediation period the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 157 million to 349 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with policy 

 

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity 

 

employees 

 

at january 1 2011 the company had approximately 36700 employees nearly 14400 of whom were employed in the us approximately 950 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 21 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the company’s hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the company’s labor agreements in the us expire in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled “cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

 

if the pace of recovery in the retail residential and commercial markets in the americas europe or asia is sluggish or general economic conditions do not improve it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

the company conducts business in various parts of the world primarily in the united states and europe and to a lesser extent in mexico central america the caribbean south america canada asia and australia as a result of this worldwide exposure the company’s businesses could be adversely affected by a decline in the us and international economies particularly with respect to residential and commercial markets including but not limited to recession inflation or deflation it is possible any such softness may result in an unfavorable impact on sales earnings and cash flows also any deterioration of retail automotive residential or commercial construction markets changes in consumer purchasing power or in general economic conditions could reduce demand for company products and therefore have a material adverse effect on sales earnings and cash flows in addition due to such economic conditions it is possible certain customers’ creditworthiness may erode resulting in increased writeoffs of customer receivables 

 

the failure to successfully integrate the businesses of stanley and black  decker in the expected time frame could adversely affect the company’s future results 

 

the success of the merger will depend in large part on the ability of the company to realize the anticipated benefits including cost savings from combining the businesses of stanley and black  decker to realize these anticipated benefits the businesses of stanley and black  decker must be successfully integrated this integration is complex and timeconsuming the failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger 

 

potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following 

 

 8 

 

  

the company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial integrationrelated expenses resulting from the merger 

 

the company will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger and the integration of black  decker including certain restructuring actions that may be taken to achieve synergies approximately 200 million of pretax restructuring and integration expense pertaining to the merger is expected to be incurred over the next two years in order to achieve an additional estimated 290 million of pretax annualized synergy benefits there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales billing payroll manufacturing marketing and benefits while the company has assumed an estimated 200 million of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that the company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings during 2010 the company incurred 538 million of pretax merger and acquisitionrelated charges primarily related to restructuring costs associated with facility closures employee severance charges certain executive compensation charges investment banking fees and integration related advisory and consulting fees while management believes the 200 million estimate is reasonable the amount of future integration expense is not certain and could result in the company taking significant additional charges against earnings in future periods 

 

the company’s growth and repositioning strategies include acquisitions the company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of recent acquisitions and the company may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates 

 

in 2002 the company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth markets through acquisitions and divestitures the strategy has been advanced over the last several years with the merger and the acquisition of a number of companies including stanley solutions de sécurité “ssds” crcevans pipeline international “crcevans” gmt infologix générale de protection “gdp” xmark corporation “xmark” sonitrol corporation “sonitrol” and hsm electronic protection services inc “hsm” 

 

the company expends significant resources identifying opportunities to acquire new lines of business and companies that could contribute to its success and expansion into existing and new markets although the company has extensive experience with acquisitions there can be no assurance that recently acquired companies will be successfully integrated or that anticipated cost savings synergies or other benefits will be realized if the company successfully integrates the acquired companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy there can be no assurance that these acquired businesses will enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability 

 

in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain the necessary financing complete the transactions or successfully integrate the new companies as necessary to continue its growth and repositioning strategies if the company is unable to successfully integrate acquisitions it could have a material adverse affect on its business financial condition and future growth 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

 

in addition to the merger the company made one other significant acquisition of crcevans in 2010 in addition to nine smaller acquisitions six small acquisitions in 2009 and a number of more significant acquisitions in 2008 including but not limited to gdp in october 2008 and sonitrol and xmark in july 2008 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 

  

any intangible assets that the company acquires may have a negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed in addition the success of the company’s future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to 

 

  

failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large writeoffs contingent liabilities substantial depreciation adverse tax or other consequences the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of black  decker crcevans ssds and certain other smaller acquisitions made in the past two years the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

 

the company has incurred and may incur in the future significant indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company’s access to external sources of liquidity the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

 

as described in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company has a committed revolving credit agreement expiring in february 2013 supporting borrowings up to 800 million upon closing of the merger the company entered into a 700 million revolving credit agreement that became effective on march 12 2010 and will expire in march 2011 these agreements include provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to 250 million in euros and pounds sterling which may be available to among other things fund acquisitions 

 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 

 10 

  

future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

 

the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements 

 

from time to time the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates including forward contracts and swap agreements the failure of one or more counterparties to the company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials component parts freight energy labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and costeffective manner 

 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel zinc copper brass aluminum and nickel and resin also represents a significant commodity used in production additionally the company uses other commoditybased materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

 

further as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations in a limited number of circumstances the magnitude of the company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions delays inefficiencies or an inability to market products an increase in valueadded tax rebates currently available to the company or to its suppliers could also increase the costs of the company’s manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

 

tight capital and credit markets could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s or its customers’ ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity 

 

the company’s growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in late 2008 and in early 2009 market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from such a credit crisis 

on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products andor customer insolvencies and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the company’s treasury operations 

 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

 

the company manufactures and sell its products in many countries throughout the world as a result there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2010 foreign currency translation positively impacted earnings by 004 per diluted share the translation impact has been more material in the past and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods component parts and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on 

short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

 

the company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs 

 

the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and eliminate excess capacity the company has also undertaken restructuring actions the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors including economic weakness competitive pressures and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated would adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

 

changes in customer preferences the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers inventory reductions by customers and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company’s business 

 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2010 however on a proforma basis as if black  decker were part of the company’s results for the entire year 2010 the two largest customers comprised nearly 21 of net sales and us mass merchants and home centers collectively comprised approximately 31 of net sales the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition the company’s major customers are volume purchasers a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

 

during 2009 the company experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the industrial segment generally sells to distributors where the company does not have point of sale data to see end user demand trends however a substantial portion of the overall volume declines within the industrial segment was believed to be attributable to such destocking or customer inventory adjustments the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments further the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company’s future results 

 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

a significant portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

 

as a result of the merger and previous acquisitions the company has 5942 billion of goodwill 1652 billion of indefinitelived trade names and 1220 billion of definitelived intangible assets at january 1 2011 the 

company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences 

 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company future tax law changes may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes effective also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

 

the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims and regulatory actions 

 

in addition the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted some of the company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations in addition the company is currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and cleanup costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of 

quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

 

the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services lead product innovation respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

 

the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels could also negatively impact its business the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure 

 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates 

 

in addition the company is in the process of implementing system conversions to sap to provide a common platform across most of its businesses there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations 

 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire earthquake hurricane or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

 

unforeseen events including war terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations disrupt the operations of our suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability these events could reduce demand for our products and make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture our products deliver products to customers or to receive materials from suppliers 

 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes 

 

the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities bonds and other fixed income securities and money market instruments the company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans during 2010 the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of 277 million and it expects to contribute approximately 140 million to its defined benefit plans in 2011 

 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years the fair value of these assets at january 1 2011 was 1751 billion 

 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company’s performance and prospects for future growth 

 

the company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced that increase in costs which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company’s results of operations market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in 2011 may not meet sales expectations due to various factors such as the failure to accurately predict market demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards moreover the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies the company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met 

 

the company’s products could be subject to product liability claims and litigation 

 

the company manufactures products configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation if such products systems and services are not properly manufactured configured installed designed or delivered personal injuries property damage or business interruption could result which could subject the company to claims for damages the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial the company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims whether or not successful 

 

the company’s products could be recalled 

 

the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall repair or replacement of the company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company’s reputation

significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of the company’s strategic objectives as well as events impacting the company’s financial performance in 2010 and 2009 are discussed below 

 

merger 

 

as discussed in item 1 above on march 12 2010 stanley completed the merger in connection with the merger stanley changed its name to stanley black  decker inc throughout this mda references to the “company” refer to stanley black  decker inc the company’s consolidated financial statements include black  decker’s results of operations and cash flows from march 13 2010 

 

as detailed in note e merger and acquisitions black  decker stockholders received 1275 shares of stanley common stock for each share of black  decker common stock outstanding as of the merger date outstanding black  decker equity awards primarily stock options were similarly exchanged for stanley equity awards after the exchange was completed premerger stanley shareowners retained ownership of 505 of the newly combined company based on the 5786 closing price of stanley common stock on march 12 2010 the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred to consummate the merger was 4657 billion 

 

management believes the merger is a transformative event bringing together two highly complementary companies with iconic brands rich histories and common distribution channels yet with minimal product overlap the merger also enables a global offering in hand and power tools as well as hardware thus enhancing the company’s value proposition to customers management believes the value unlocked by the anticipated 425 million in cost synergies expected to be achieved by the end of 2012 will help fuel future growth and facilitate global cost leadership this updated cost synergy estimate represents a 75 million increase from the original 350 million by march 2013 at the time of the merger the cost synergy drivers are business unit and regional consolidation management sales force and shared services integration 

145 million purchasing materials freight etc 100 million corporate overhead 95 million and manufacturing and distribution facility consolidation 85 million the company is ahead of plan on the integration of the two companies and realized 135 million of the cost synergies in 2010 which is 45 million more than originally forecasted for the nine month period that followed the merger an additional 165 million of cost synergies are anticipated in 2011 and an incremental 125 million in 2012 to achieve the total cumulative 425 million in cost synergies in 2012 of the 330 million in cost synergies pertaining to operations all but the 95 million of corporate overhead the benefit by segment is estimated to be 70 in cdiy 20 in security mechanical access solutions and 10 in industrial management estimates there will be an additional 200 million in total costs incurred over the next two years to achieve these synergies from the merger 

 

additionally it is projected that revenue synergies from the merger will be in the range of 300 million to 400 million by 2013 which implies a benefit of 035 — 050 of earnings per diluted share revenue synergies are expected to add an incremental 50 basis points approximately 50 million to 2011 revenue growth and have a modest earnings impact with remaining revenue synergies to be achieved in 2012 and 2013 the anticipated revenue synergies will come from geographic expansion into latin america and other emerging markets leveraging preexisting infrastructure 30 channel and crossselling of existing products such as the sale of power tools through the company’s industrial and automotive repair distributors 30 brand expansion ie utilizing the array of powerful brands in different product categories and channels and expanding across the globe as exemplified by the recent introduction of dewalt hand tools in certain channels 30 and joint new product development which entails leveraging development expertise from both legacy companies to pursue new product opportunities 10 the cdiy segment is expected to realize approximately twothirds of the revenue synergies and the remainder will be split evenly in the industrial and security segments in 2011 the company intends to increase capital expenditures to 25 — 28 of revenues partially as a result of infrastructure improvements to foster attainment of the revenue synergies in 2012 and beyond the capital expenditure ratio is expected to return to more historical levels 20 — 25 of revenues in 2012 

 

industrial segment — acquisition of crcevans pipeline international 

 

on july 29 2010 the company acquired crcevans pipeline international “crcevans” for a purchase price of 4516 million net of cash acquired with fiscal 2010 revenues of approximately 250 million crcevans immediately established a scalable global growth business platform for the company to capitalize on favorable endmarket trends in the oil and gas infrastructure area crcevans is a supplier of specialized tools equipment and services used in the construction of large diameter oil and natural gas transmission pipelines crc evans also sells and rents custom pipe handling and joint welding and coating equipment used in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines the acquisition of crcevans diversifies the company’s revenue base and provides the company with a strategic and profitable growth platform crcevans has been consolidated into the company’s industrial segment the company funded the acquisition with its existing sources of liquidity this acquisition was slightly accretive to earnings in 2010 and the company expects that it will be over 010 accretive to diluted earnings per share by 2013 

 

continued growth in the security segment 

 

during 2010 the company further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry annual revenues of the security segment have grown to 2113 billion or 25 of 2010 sales up from 216 million or 10 of 2001 sales the year the security expansion strategy was launched key recent events pertaining to the growth of this segment include the following 

 

 25 

 

  

the additions of the hhi business and the acquisitions discussed above complement the existing security segment product offerings increase its scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to customers as industry dynamics favor multisolution providers that offer “onestop shopping” 

 

drive further profitable growth in branded tools and storage 

 

while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion in the company’s specified growth platforms is important management recognizes that the branded tool and storage product offerings in the cdiy and industrial segment businesses are important foundations of the company that provide strong cash flow generation and growth prospects management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development as evidenced by the success of the 12volt max subcompact lithium ion cordless power tool products in the cdiy segment and the expert tool product launch in the industrial segment brand support an increased weighting in emerging markets and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long term acquisitionrelated growth will also be pursued where appropriate the merger is clearly an indicator of the company’s commitment to this strategic objective

the company continues to practice the operating disciplines encompassed by the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” and has made further enhancements to it as the sfs disciplines take hold they will improve working capital turns  cash flow and other efficiencies that will foster improved profitability sfs employs continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations and drive efficiency throughout the supply chain the newly enhanced sfs has six primary elements that work in concert sales and operations planning “sop” operational lean complexity reduction global supply management ordertocash excellence and common platforms sop is a dynamic and continuous unified process that links and balances supply and demand in a manner that produces worldclass fill rates while minimizing dsi days sales of inventory operational lean is the systemic application of lean principles in progressive steps throughout the enterprise to optimize flow toward a predefined end state by eliminating waste increasing efficiency and driving value complexity reduction is a focused and overt effort to eradicate costly and unnecessary complexity from our products supply chain and back room process and organizations complexity reduction enables all other sfs elements and when successfully deployed results in worldclass cost speed of execution and customer satisfaction global supply management focuses on strategically leveraging the company’s scale to achieve the best possible price and payment terms with the best possible quality service and delivery among all categories of spend ordertocash excellence is a methodical processbased approach that provides a userfriendly automated and errorproof customer experience from intenttopurchase to shipping and billing to payment while minimizing cash collection cycle time and dso days sales outstanding common platforms are an essential component of leveraging technology to facilitate organic growth and integration of acquired companies the company develops standardized business processes and system platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability other benefits of sfs include reductions in lead times rapid realization of synergies during acquisition integrations and focus on employee safety sfs disciplines helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years it was instrumental in the reduction of working capital during 2010 as evidenced by the improvement in working capital turns for legacy stanley from 46 in 2003 to 86 in 2010 furthermore working capital turns experienced a 10 improvement from 52 including black and decker for the full year of 2009 at the end of 2009 to 57 at the end of 2010 in 2011 and beyond the company plans to further leverage sfs to generate ongoing improvements in working capital turns cycle times complexity reduction and customer service levels 

 

 

certain items impacting earnings merger and acquisitionrelated charges impacting 2010 and 2009 earnings 

 

the company reported 538 million in pretax charges in 2010 pertaining to the merger and acquisitions which were comprised of the following 

 

  

the tax effect on the above charges during 2010 some of which were not tax deductible was 117 million resulting in aftertax merger and acquisitionrelated charges of 421 million or 280 per diluted share 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company incurred 18 million in aftertax charges or 022 per diluted share primarily related to the transaction and integration planning costs associated with the merger 

 

throughout this mda the company has provided a discussion of the outlook and results both inclusive and exclusive of the merger and acquisitionrelated charges the amounts and measures including gross profit and segment profit on a basis excluding such charges are considered relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the company’s results aside from the material impact of the merger and acquisitionrelated charges the measures are utilized internally by management to understand business trends as once the aforementioned anticipated cost synergies from the black  decker integration are realized such charges are expected to subside 

 

other items 

 

aside from the costs associated with the merger and acquisitions discussed above other matters having a significant impact on the company’s results in the 2008 — 2010 period were inflation currency exchange rate fluctuations debt extinguishment gains and other restructuring actions 

 

  

outlook for 2011 

 

this outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the company’s nearterm earnings prospects and not to discuss the various factors affecting such projections management expects earnings per diluted share “eps” to be in the range of 429 to 454 in 2011 excluding the effects of merger and acquisitionrelated charges 2011 eps is expected to be in the range of 475 to 500

simultaneous with the offering of the convertible preferred units the company entered into capped call transactions equity options with counterparties the total premium paid in 2010 for the capped call transactions was 503 million and was classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows each of the capped call transactions has a term of approximately five years and in aggregate the transactions cover subject to antidilution adjustments the maximum number of the company’s common shares issuable upon settlement of the convertible preferred stock these transactions provide the company the right to buy shares of its own common stock from the counterparties at a strike price of 7500 per share which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the convertible preferred stock and also obligate the company to sell shares of its own common stock to the counterparties at a strike price of 9795 the capped call transactions may be settled by net share settlement or at the company’s option and subject to certain conditions cash settlement or physical settlement the value received by the company if the capped call transactions are exercised when the company’s common stock price is above 7500 can be utilized to offset the dilution that may occur should holders of the convertible preferred stock elect to convert refer to note h long term debt and financing arrangements for further detail 

 

on september 29 2008 the company issued 2500 million of unsecured term notes maturing october 1 2013 the “2013 term notes” with fixed interest payable semiannually in arrears at a rate of 615 per annum the 2013 term notes rank equally with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt the company received net proceeds of 2480 million which includes a discount of 05 million to achieve a 615 interest rate and 15 million of fees associated with the transaction the proceeds were utilized to repay shortterm borrowings 

 

in 2008 the company utilized the proceeds from the 250 million of longterm debt issued in september 2008 as well as the 159 million in net proceeds from divestitures to repay shortterm borrowings which was partially offset by the cash outflows for business acquisitions and other matters 

 

on february 27 2008 the company amended its credit facility to provide for an increase and extension of its committed credit facility to 800 million from 550 million in may 2008 the company’s commercial paper program was also increased to 800 million following the merger the company increased its committed credit facilities to 15 billion from 800 million the credit facilities are diversified amongst twenty five financial institutions the credit facilities are designated as a liquidity backstop for the company’s commercial paper program the 5 year amended and restated facility expires in february 2013 the 364 days revolving credit 

facility expires in march 2011 as of january 1 2011 there were no outstanding loans under these facilities or any commercial paper outstanding 

 

the company increased its cash dividend per common share to 134 in 2010 dividends per common share increased 31 in 2010 32 in 2009 and 33 in 2008 in continuing its trend of dividend growth to its shareowners the company announced on february 15 2011 that it will increase its quarterly dividend to 041 per common share which represents a 21 increase over 2010 quarterly dividend rates 

 

the company repurchased 5 million of common stock in 2010 in 2009 the company repurchased 3 million of common stock and in 2008 the company repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock for 103 million an average of 4611 per share proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled 396 million in 2010 61 million in 2009 and 19 million in 2008 the company received 320 million of cash proceeds in may 2010 from the forward stock purchase contracts element of the equity units the remaining amounts in each year mainly relate to employee and retiree stock option exercises 

 

credit ratings and liquidity the company has strong investment grade credit ratings from all major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a as well as its shortterm commercial paper borrowings while the ratings from certain agencies were unfavorably changed following the merger the current credit ratings are investment grade and the company continues to have full access to credit markets based on its current standing and historically strong cash flows from operations which are expected to further improve in 2011 and future years as the cash outflows pertaining to restructuring and merger integration actions subside among other positive factors the company expects it will continue to have strong investment grade credit ratings as detailed in note h longterm debt and financing arrangements the company has 3434 billion of debt including 416 million of current maturities and 16 million of shortterm borrowings at january 1 2011 the debt has wellstaggered maturities over many years cash and cash equivalents total 1745 billion at january 1 2011 concurrent with the merger the company has made a determination to repatriate 1636 billion an estimated 1193 billion after taxes of legacy black  decker foreign earnings in the future management believes the company has ample liquidity and a healthy capital structure for both the near and longterm failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to access the 15 billion committed credit facilities

market risk 

 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into crosscurrency swaps and forward contracts to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2010 would have been approximately a 62 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause a “transactional” impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars as previously discussed it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 81 million or 047 per diluted share with respect to transactional foreign currency market risk the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the chinese rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases which could adversely impact profitability in the event significant rmb or other currency appreciation occurs the company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact based on current exchange rates management does not anticipate that foreign exchange will have a significant impact on 2011 results additionally management has allowed for an approximately 3 appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar in providing 2011 earnings guidance as discussed in the 2011 outlook section of this mda 

 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor and euribor rates at january 1 2011 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects the company experienced inflation primarily commodity and freight of approximately 70 million and 140 million in 2010 and 2008 respectively while it experienced mild deflation in 2009 cumulatively during 2008 — 2010 the company recovered more than two thirds of inflation through customer pricing however price erosion occurred in 2010 and the net unfavorable price  inflation impact for 2010 was over 120 million management estimates inflation in 2011 will adversely impact profits by 100 basis points inclusive of approximately 3 chinese rmb currency appreciation effect commodity and sourced product costs may increase in the future and in that event there would be an unfavorable impact on earnings to the extent not recovered through customer pricing and other cost reduction actions 

 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of mda additionally the company has 23 million of liabilities as of january 1 2011 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years in 2010 and 2009 there were 138 million and 48 million in investment returns on pension plan assets respectively compared with a 71 million loss on plan assets in 2008 due to volatile financial markets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately 140 million in 2011 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk 

management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

 

the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 

 

other matters 

 

employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an employee stock ownership plan “esop” under which the ongoing us cornerstone and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop activity amounted to expense of 3 million in 2010 and 8 million of income and 11 million of expense in 2009 and 2008 respectively the esop income in 2009 stems from the suspension of the cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the 401k match as a percentage of employee contributions as part of cost saving actions the company reinstated these benefits for 2010 and as a result there was an increase in expense in 2010 more aligned with 2008 and prior years esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

 

customerrelated risks — the company has significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are none that exceed 10 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

 

there are no individually material credit exposures from particular customers while the company has strong credit policies and disciplined management of receivables due to weak economic conditions or other factors it is reasonably possible that certain customers’ creditworthiness may decline and losses from receivable writeoffs may increase 

 

new accounting standards — refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position 

 

critical accounting estimates — preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial 

obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

 

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete — inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

 

property plant and equipment — the company generally values property plant and equipment “ppe” at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company recorded 24 million in asset impairment losses in 2010 primarily as a result of restructuring initiatives and such losses may occur in the future 

 

goodwill and intangible assets — the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists other intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate the company completed the merger and acquisitions in 2010 and 2009 valued at 52 billion and 24 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 5942 billion of goodwill and 1652 billion of indefinitelived trade names at january 1 2011 

 

in accordance with asc 35020 management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is a reportable operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below a reportable operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics as a result of organization structure simplification effective in the beginning of fiscal 2010 the company modified the number of reporting units from seven premerger to six if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is 

greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years these assumptions contemplate business market and overall economic conditions the fair value of indefinitelived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used include discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales 

 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2010 based on this testing the company determined that the fair value of its reporting units and indefinitelived trade names exceeded their carrying values the discount rate used in testing goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of 2010 was 95 for all reporting units the nearterm revenue growth rates and the perpetual growth rates which varied for each reporting unit ranged from 4 to 8 and 2 to 4 respectively in 2010 as compared with 2009 in consideration of market conditions the discount rate assumption decreased 100 basis points and perpetual growth rates decreased 100 basis points in some reporting units which had the effect of reducing the estimated fair values management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate perpetual and nearterm revenue growth rates in all reporting units the discount rate was decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rates were decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the nearterm revenue growth rates were reduced by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated based upon the company’s 2010 annual impairment testing analysis including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 

 

in the event that the company’s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analysis while a useful tool should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 

 

defined benefit obligations — the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions these assumptions which are updated annually include discount rates expected return on plan assets future salary increase rates and health care cost trend rates the company considers current market conditions including interest rates to establish these assumptions discount rates are developed considering the yields available on highquality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations the company’s weightedaverage discount rate for both the united states and international pension plans was 525 and 575 at january 1 2011 and january 3 2010 respectively as discussed further in note l employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors which include its targeted asset allocation percentages historic returns and expected future returns for 2010 net periodic benefit cost the company’s longterm rate of return assumption was 75 and 675 for united states and international plans respectively the company will use a 7 expected rate of return assumption for 2011 net periodic benefit cost reflecting a relatively higher proportion of fixed income plan assets 

 

the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate however differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and if in excess of a specified corridor amortized over future periods the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets accordingly market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net 

periodic benefit cost in the following year the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by 713 million at january 1 2011 the merger resulted in a significant increase in defined benefit plan obligations and related expense the primary black  decker us pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010 as well as the only material black  decker international plan and the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans as of january 1 2011 83 of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions the company recognized 39 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2010 inclusive of 20 million in net curtailment settlement gains management expects the expense for these plans will decrease by approximately 10 million in 2011 

 

environmental — the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 

 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

 

as of january 1 2011 the company had reserves of 173 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the merger resulted in a significant increase in environmental reserves and related expense the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 157 million to 349 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

 

income taxes — income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities deferred tax assets including net operating losses are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is “more likely than not” that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

 

the company is subject to tax in a number of locations including many state and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required when calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent 

uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

risk insurance — to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence and 49 million in the aggregate per annum the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of 13 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 106 million and 42 million as of january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 respectively are adequate the merger resulted in a significant increase in us risk insurance reserves and related expense due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

 

warranty — the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 120 million and 67 million reserves for expected warranty claims as of january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 respectively is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability the merger resulted in a significant increase in warranty reserves and related expense the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a productspecific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 

 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

 

synthetic leases — the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 9 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2010 as of january 1 2011 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 41 million and 35 million respectively

competition 

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands its commitment to customer service strong customer relationships the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product innovation 

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the company’s the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines in that segment certain large customers offer private label brands “house brands” that compete across a wider spectrum of the company’s cdiy segment product offerings the company is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world the company is a significant manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners for the construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroad utilities and public works the company also believes that it is among the largest direct providers of commercial access security integration and alarm monitoring services in north america 

customers 

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss the loss of certain of the larger home centers or mass merchants as customers could have a material adverse effect on the company until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has been able to maintain a diversified customer base and has decreased customer concentration risk over the past several years as sales from continuing operations in markets outside of the home center and mass merchant distribution channels have grown at a greater rate through a combination of acquisitions and other efforts to broaden the customer base primarily in the security and industrial segments in this regard sales to the company’s largest customer as a percentage of total sales have decreased from 22 in 2002 to less than 6 in 2009 

within the security segment a large portion of sales are generated in the retail sector the security segment also has significant sales to commercial governmental and educational customers

backlog 

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the company’s cdiy and industrial segment businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 6 2010 the company had approximately 320 million in unfilled orders all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year as of february 2 2009 unfilled orders amounted to 348 million 

patents and trademarks

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide the stanley ® and stanley in a notched rectangle ® trademarks are material to all three business segments these wellknown trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are among the world’s most trusted brand names the company’s tagline “make something great tm ” is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments the best ®  blick ®  hsm ®  national ®  sargent  greenleaf ®  sg ® sonitrol ®  sonitrol globe design ®  gdp tm  and xmark ® trademarks are material to the security segment the labounty ®  mac ®  mac tools ®  proto ®  vidmar tm  facom ®  virax ® and usag ® trademarks are material to the industrial segment in the cdiy segment the bostitch ®  bailey ®  powerlock ®  tape rule case design powerlock and fatmax ® family of trademarks are material the terms of these trademarks vary typically from 10 to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms 

environmental regulations 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including sixteen active superfund sites current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the company’s volumetric contribution at these sites 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to 

reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of january 2 2010 the company had reserves of 30 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable 

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

employees 

at january 2 2010 the company had approximately 16700 employees nearly 8200 of whom were employed in the us approximately 700 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 19 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the company’s hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the company’s labor agreements in the us expire in 2010 2011 and 2012 there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled “cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

if the current weakness continues in the retail residential and commercial markets in the americas europe or asia or general economic conditions worsen it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

approximately 35 of 2009 sales were in the cdiy segment and 24 in the industrial segment the company experienced a 20 sales unit volume decline in its existing businesses ie excluding acquisitions during 2009 primarily in these two segments as the recession spread worldwide the company’s businesses have been adversely affected by the decline in the us and international economies particularly with respect to residential and commercial markets it is possible this softness will be prolonged and to the extent it persists there may be an unfavorable impact on sales earnings and cash flows it is possible the security segment which experienced an 8 unit volume declines in existing businesses in 2009 may become more affected if the economic weakness permeates other market sectors it serves further deterioration of these retail residential or commercial construction markets or in general economic conditions could reduce demand for company products and therefore have a material adverse effect on sales earnings and cash flows in addition due to current economic conditions it is possible certain customers’ creditworthiness may erode resulting in increased writeoffs of customer receivables 

the company’s growth and repositioning strategies include acquisitions the company’s recent acquisitions may not further its strategies and the company may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates 

in 2002 the company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth markets through acquisitions and divestitures the strategy has been advanced over the last several years with the acquisition of a number of companies including general de protection “gdp” xmark corporation “xmark” sonitrol corporation “sonitrol” hsm electronic protection services inc “hsm” facom sa “facom” national manufacturing co “national” besco pneumatic corporation “besco” blick plc “blick” frisco bay industries ltd “frisco bay” isr solutions inc “isr” security group inc “security group” and best lock corporation and its affiliates “best access” 

although the company has extensive experience with acquisitions there can be no assurance that recently acquired companies will be successfully integrated or that anticipated synergies will be realized if the company successfully integrates the acquired companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy there can be no assurance that its resulting business segments will enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability 

in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain the necessary financing complete the transactions or successfully integrate the new companies as necessary to continue its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

the company made six small acquisitions in 2009 and a number of more significant acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 including but not limited to gdp in october 2008 sonitrol and xmark in july 2008 innerspace in july 2007 and hsm in january 2007 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 

any intangible assets that the company acquires may have a negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed in addition the success of the company’s future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to 

 

failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of gdp the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

on november 2 2009 the company announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with black  decker in an allstock transaction under the terms of the agreement which has been approved by the boards of directors of the company and black  decker each outstanding share of black  decker will be converted into the right to receive 1275 shares of the company’s common stock upon closing it is expected that the company’s shareholders will own approximately 505 of the equity of the combined company and black  decker shareholders will own approximately 495 the company expects the transaction which is subject to among other things the approval of the merger by black  decker’s shareholders the approval of the issuance of the company’s common stock and certain amendments to the company’s certificate of incorporation by the company’s shareholders as well as customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions to close on march 12 2010 please read the section entitled “risk factors” beginning on page 19 of the joint proxy statementprospectus contained in the company’s registration statement on form s4 as amended filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 2 2010 for certain risks associated with this particular transaction 

the company may incur significant additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with future acquisitions which may restrict the manner in which it conducts business the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as more fully described in item 1 on november 2 2009 the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with black  decker which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies the merger will entail a material issuance of common stock if consummated 

as more fully described in item 7 and note h longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company completed concurrent offerings of floating rate equity units and 5 senior notes due 2010 the net proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of hsm in addition the company has a committed revolving credit agreement expiring in february 2013 supporting borrowings up to 800 million this agreement includes provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to 250 million in euros and pounds sterling which may be available to among other things fund acquisitions 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 

the company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its 800 million revolving credit facility the interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to adjusted interest expense “adjusted ebitda” “adjusted interest expense” as both terms are defined in the debt agreement adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization excluding certain restructuring charges and with interest expense adjusted as follows adjusted interest expense excludes imputed noncash interest expense in respect of convertible bonds issued by the company as calculated in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s accounting standards codification 47020 “debt with conversion and other options” the ratio required for compliance is 35 adjusted ebitda to 10 adjusted interest expense and is computed quarterly on a rolling twelve months last twelve months basis under this covenant definition the interest coverage ratio was 10 times adjusted ebitda or higher in each of the 2009 quarterly measurement periods management does not believe it is reasonably likely the company will breach this covenant 

future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions that affect the cost of raw materials freight energy labor and sourced finished goods 

the company’s products are manufactured of both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel aluminum zinc brass nickel and copper as well as resin additionally the company uses other commodity based materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors as described in more detail in item 7 hereto the company has been negatively impacted by inflation in recent years if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

tight capital and credit markets could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s or its customers’ ability to borrow or otherwise obtain cash 

the company’s growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in late 2008 and in early 2009 market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on the company’s businesses including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products andor customer insolvencies and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the company’s treasury operations 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global operations enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted in 2009 foreign currency translation negatively impacted earnings by 004 per diluted share the translation impact has been more material in the past and may be more material in the future although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods components and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the us or the european union or making it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

large customer concentrations and related customer inventory adjustments may negatively impact sales results of operations and cash flows 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represents more than 10 of consolidated net sales the loss or material reduction of business from or the lack of success of sales initiatives for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in addition unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

during 2009 the company experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting destocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets such distributor destocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession the industrial segment generally sells to distributors where the company does not have point of sale data to see end user demand trends however a substantial portion of the overall 30 volume declines within the industrial segment is believed to be attributable to such destocking or customer inventory adjustments  the company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of acquisitions the company has 1818 billion of goodwill 305 million of indefinitelived trade names and 472 million of definitelived intangible assets at january 2 2010 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other matters causing a decline in expected future cash flows 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company future tax law changes may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes effective also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

as described in further detail in items 1 and 3 and note s contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims regulatory actions and environmental matters 

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company faces active competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes including those of acquired businesses its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other facilities 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations and insurance policies that partially mitigate these risks the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates management believes it has effective disaster recovery plans and that it is unlikely there would be more than a shortlived disruption to its computer and communication systems due to these physical concentrations of equipment or from potential occurrences of damage and interruption however it is reasonably possible that results could be adversely impacted if equipment outages were prolonged due to an unusually serious event in addition the company is planning system conversions to sap to provide a common platform across most of its businesses the implementations from legacy systems to sap will occur in carefully managed stages over a period of several years in the americas and ultimately thereafter in europe and asia management believes the planned system conversions are costbeneficial and will further enhance productivity in its operations there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating and other expenses certain us employee and director benefit plan expense is affected by the market value of the company’s common stock 

as described in further detail in note l employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans as well as an employee stock ownership plan “esop” under which the primary us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities bonds and other fixed income securities and money market instruments the company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans the company expects to contribute approximately 17 million to its pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans in 2010 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years during 2009 there was a 48 million gain on pension plan assets the fair value of these assets at january 2 2010 was 320 million 

overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop activity amounted to income of 8 million in 2009 and expense of 11 million and 2 million in both 2008 and 2007 respectively the esop income in 2009 stems from the suspension of certain employee benefits as part of cost saving actions the company has reinstated these benefits in 2010 and expects there will be an increase in expense in 2010 more aligned with 2008 and prior years the increase in expense from 2007 to 2008 was mostly attributable to the average market value of shares released which decreased from 5604 in 2007 to 4365 in 2008 as well as increased benefits pertaining to headcount expansions related to acquisitions esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results

pending black  decker merger 

on november 2 2009 the company and black  decker announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which stanley and black  decker will combine under the name stanley black  decker in an allstock transaction under the terms of the agreement each outstanding share of black  decker will be converted into a fixed ratio of 1275 shares of the company’s common stock based on the closing price of the company’s common stock on january 27 2010 the consideration to be received by black  decker shareholders in the merger has a value of approximately 6690 per black  decker share or 42 billion in the aggregate the final consideration to be received by black  decker shareholders will be measured at the closing date of the merger using the market price of the company’s common stock at that time upon closing it is expected that the company’s shareholders will own approximately 505 of the equity of the combined company and black  decker shareholders will own approximately 495 the terms of the proposed combination and other information about both companies are included in the form s4 registration statement and proxy declared effective february 3 2010 

while the us antitrust review is complete the closing of the transaction is subject to other customary closing conditions including foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of stanley and black  decker shareholders who will vote on the merger proposal in special meetings to be held on march 12 2010 closing of the transaction is expected to occur on march 12 2010 

management believes the pending black  decker merger is a transformative opportunity to bring together two highly complementary companies with iconic brands and rich histories yet with virtually no overlap the merger would enable a comprehensive global offering in both hand and power tools among other product offerings management believes the value unlocked by the anticipated 350 million of annual cost synergies expected to be achieved within three years will help fuel future growth and cement global cost leadership 

strategic objectives 

for several years the company has pursued a diversification strategy to enable profitable growth the strategy involves industry geographic and customer diversification as exemplified by the expansion of security solution product offerings the growing proportion of sales outside the us and the reduction of the company’s dependence on sales to us home centers and mass merchants in addition the company has indicated a desire to be a consolidator of the tool industry sales outside the us represented 42 of the total in 2009 up from 29 in 2002 sales to us home centers and mass merchants have declined from a high point of approximately 40 in 2002 to approximately 15 in 2009 execution of this strategy has entailed approximately 28 billion of acquisitions since the beginning of 2002 several divestitures and increased brand investments over the past several years the company has generated strong free cash flow and received substantial proceeds from divestitures that enabled a transformation of the business portfolio 

the company’s longterm capital allocation objectives pertaining to the deployment of free cash flow after meeting its debt service obligations are 

 

the company strives to operate in markets where the brand is meaningful the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable the longterm capital allocation strategy with respect to growth is focused on three strong existing platforms convergent security mechanical security and industrial and automotive tools the company plans to expand these existing platforms through both organic growth and international acquisitions management intends to be a consolidator in the tool industry and to increase its relative weighting in emerging markets objectives which are both well met by the pending black  decker merger the merger will also round out the mechanical security product offerings and brings with it another strong growth platform in engineered fastening additionally the company has begun to develop two emerging growth platforms healthcare and infrastructure 

significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of the company’s diversification strategy as well as events impacting the company’s financial performance in 2009 and 2008 are discussed below 

continued growth in the security business 

during 2009 the company further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry annual revenues of the security segment have grown to 1560 billion or 42 of 2009 sales up from 216 million or 10 of 2001 sales the year the security expansion strategy was launched key recent events pertaining to the growth of this segment include the following 

 

 

the acquisitions complement the existing security segment product offerings increase its scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to customers as industry dynamics favor multisolution providers that offer “onestop shopping” the sonitrol integration into hsm is essentially complete with the business sharing the same information technology platform duplicative field offices and a monitoring center have been closed the reverse integration of the company’s preexisting systems integration business into hsm is also complete which contributed to the continuing improvement in the segment profit rate to 197 in 2009 up from 179 in 2008 

drive further profitable growth in branded tools and storage 

while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion in the security platforms is important management recognizes that the branded tool and storage product offerings in the cdiy and industrial segment businesses are important foundations of the company that provide strong cash flow generation and growth prospects management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development brand support an increased weighting in emerging markets and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long term acquisitionrelated growth will also be pursued where appropriate the previously discussed pending black  decker merger clearly is an indicator of the company’s commitment to the strategic objective 

continue to invest in the stanley brand 

stanley has a strong portfolio of brands associated with highquality products including stanley ®  facom ®  mac ®  proto ®  vidmar ®  bostitch ® and fatmax ®  the stanley ® brand is recognized as one of the world’s great brands and is one of the company’s most valuable assets brand support spending has averaged approximately 21 million annually since 2005 up sharply from the preceding years this sustained brand support has yielded a steady improvement across the spectrum of brand awareness measures notably a climb in unaided stanley hand tool brand awareness from 27 in 2005 to 48 in 2009 stanley had prominent signage at 11 major league baseball stadiums throughout 2009 and is continuing its program in the coming season the company is also maintaining longstanding nascar racing sponsorships which will entail brand exposure over 38 race weekends in 2010 stanley recently entered a tenyear alliance agreement with the walt disney world resort ® whereby stanley ® logos are displayed on construction walls throughout the theme parks and stanley ®  mac ®  proto ®  and vidmar ® brand logos andor products are featured in various attractions where they will be seen by millions of visitors each year additionally stanley is “the official tool provider of the walt disney world resort ® ” in 2009 the company also began advertising in the english premier league which is the number one soccer league in the world watched weekly by 650 million people around the world the company will continue to allocate its brand and advertising spend wisely primarily to the outdoor marketing campaigns described above that foster television exposure along with various print advertisements generating more than 25 billion brand impressions annually 

continuous improvement from the stanley fulfillment system 

the company continued to practice the operating disciplines encompassed by the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” sfs employs continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations and drive efficiency throughout the supply chain sfs has four primary elements that work in concert sales and operations planning “sop” common system platforms transformational lean™ and complexity reduction sop focuses on keeping supply in sync with demand for products to minimize inventory while maximizing customer fill rates common systems entail standardization of processes and it platforms to provide scalability that facilitates efficiency and rapid acquisition integrations transformational lean combines traditional supply chain and manufacturing lean with back office functions to enable transformation of business models to drive competitive advantage complexity reduction focuses on standardizing processes and eradicating complexity in all

operational aspects except where customers gain value and are willing to pay for customized offerings other benefits of sfs include reductions in lead times rapid realization of synergies during acquisition integrations and focus on employee safety sfs disciplines helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years it was instrumental in the reduction of working capital during 2009 as evidenced by the 34 improvement in working capital turns from 59 at yearend 2008 to 79 at yearend 2009 in 2010 and beyond the company plans to further leverage sfs to generate ongoing improvements in working capital turns cycle times complexity reduction and customer service levels 

 

certain items impacting earnings 

aside from the strategic commentary above other matters having a significant impact on the company’s results in 2009 and  or 2008 were inflation currency exchange rate fluctuations costs associated with the black  decker merger and debt extinguishment gains in addition the weak economic conditions necessitated cost reduction actions in 2009 and 2008 

 

outlook for 2010 

this outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the company’s nearterm earnings prospects and not to discuss the various factors affecting such projections accordingly the purpose is to clarify that 2010 diluted earnings per share are projected to be higher than 2009 and that 2010 free cash flow as defined in the financial condition section of this mda is projected to be lower than 2009 working capital improvement in 2010 expected to be modest on a standalone basis ie excluding all impacts from the black  decker merger management expects 2010 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 300  325 and 2010 free cash flow in the range of 300 to 350 million

sga expense selling general and administrative expenses inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts “sga” were 1028 billion or 275 of net sales in 2009 as compared with 1108 billion or 250 of net sales in 2008 aside from acquisitions sga was 142 million lower than 2008 the decrease in sga pertains to headcount reductions and various cost containment actions such as temporarily suspending certain us retirement benefits in 2009 and sharply curtailing travel and other discretionary spending there was also a reduction in variable selling and other costs as well as favorable foreign currency translation partially offsetting these decreases was 22 million of increased spending to expand the convergent security business sales force and various brand awareness advertising campaigns and 5 million for black  decker integration planning

sga was 1108 billion or 25 of net sales in 2008 as compared with 1038 billion or 24 of net sales in 2007 acquired companies contributed 46 million of the increase the remaining 24 million increase is largely attributable to foreign exchange impact higher bad debt expense and strategic investments including those to foster growth in emerging markets partially offset by benefits from the cost reduction initiatives previously mentioned

security 

 

security segment sales increased 4 in 2009 reflecting a 12 contribution from acquisitions mainly sonitrol acquired in july 2008 and gdp acquired in october 2008 price provided a 2 sales benefit which was offset by nearly 2 of unfavorable foreign currency translation organic sales volume decreased 8 as the segment was affected by the contraction in us commercial construction and other capital spending delays associated with weak economic conditions mechanical access had somewhat steeper volume declines than convergent security but was aided by stabilization in the residential hardware markets and a hardware products rollout at a major north american retailer in the second half of the year additionally cross selling of mechanical products to convergent customers retention of national account customers and select new product introductions helped alleviate mechanical access sales volume pressures lower organic volume in convergent electronic security pertained primarily to weakness in system installations although there were some signs of improvement with national accounts late in the year as a result there was a favorable mix shift in convergent security and the overall segment to higher margin recurring monthly service revenue including security monitoring and maintenance which grew organically in a high single digit percentage range this improved sales mix shift in the segment is partially attributable to the recent expansion of the core commercial account sales force as well as a strategic emphasis on recurring service revenue and away from certain installationonly jobs the increase in the segment profit amount was attributable to acquisitions while the sustainment of organic profit at the prior year level is notable considering the headwinds from lower sales the robust 180 basis point segment profit rate expansion was enabled by the ongoing successful integration of accretive acquisitions the previously mentioned mix shift to higher margin recurring monthly service revenues the benefits of customer pricing and proactive cost reductions 

security segment sales increased 7 in 2008 primarily driven by acquisitions notably sonitrol and gdp which contributed 9 customer price increases amounted to 3 while foreign currency and organic volume declined 1 and 4 respectively the hardware business posted significant volume declines associated with the loss of a major customer in late 2007 aside from hardware the security segment had an increase in organic volume reflecting solid demand from its welldiversified customer base and associated recurring monthly revenues from service contracts for security monitoring and system maintenance the access technologies and mechanical lock businesses delivered organic sales growth pertaining to modest volume increases and disciplined recovery of inflation through customer pricing actions the reverse integration of the usbased legacy security integration business as well as the integration of the july 2008 sonitrol acquisition into hsm provided cost synergies and fostered an 80 basis point expansion of the segment profit rate the segment profit improvement was also attributable to strong execution of productivity projects partially offset by the impact of the previously discussed hardware business sales volume decline 

industrial 

 

industrial segment net sales decreased 31 in 2009 compared with 2008 price provided a 2 benefit which was offset by 2 of unfavorable foreign currency translation unit volume fell 31 about evenly in the americas and europe which was partially offset by growth in the company’s relatively less significant asian region industrial channels were down more severely than automotive repair channels the unit volume declines reflected ongoing severe economic weakness in the us and europe in addition to broadbased reduced end market demand the segment was adversely impacted by pervasive inventory corrections throughout the supply chain which abated in the fourth quarter there are signs of stabilization in the channels this business segment serves management is focusing on complexity reduction including appropriate sku rationalization and new product introductions in the facom proto and mac industrial and automotive repair businesses and believes there are opportunities to gain share in this environment segment profit fell 75 million from the prior year due to the precipitous sales volume decline which was also reflected in the segment profit rate contraction however price realization partially mitigated the sales volume and related negative manufacturing productivity effects along with a solid improvement in mac tools’ profit reflecting disciplined cost and other actions the company initiated extensive cost actions throughout the segment in late 2008 but they took longer to implement in europe due to the countryspecific works council process those actions are largely complete and were supplemented by other ongoing restructuring initiatives in 2009 as reflected in the quarterly segment profit rate that hit a trough of 92 in the third quarter and recovered to 113 in the fourth quarter 

industrial segment net sales increased 2 in 2008 versus 2007 attributable to acquisitions foreign currency translation provided a 3 benefit and favorable pricing 2 which were offset by a 5 unit volume decline the north american automotive repair business was adversely affected by distributor attrition and the deteriorating us economy european sales volumes which had been positive in the first half of the year declined in the second half as facom and other businesses reflected the contraction of the european economy these volume declines were partially offset by strong sales growth in usbased engineered storage and to a lesser extent the hydraulic tools business the sales growth in engineered storage was driven by government spending particularly by army and navy bases and also strength with commercial customers the sales volume declines created substantial headwinds from unfavorable manufacturing plant absorption causing a decrease in the segment profit strong focus on customer pricing and productivity initiatives more than offset the effects of inflation additionally the benefits of cost reduction actions partially mitigated the unfavorable impact of sales volume declines on segment profit 

cdiy 

 

cdiy net sales from continuing operations decreased 22 in 2009 from 2008 customer pricing contributed 2 to sales which was more than offset by 3 of unfavorable foreign currency translation in all regions segment unit volumes declined 21 overall comprised of 22 in both the americas and europe and 16 in asia the sales volume declines were more pronounced in fastening systems bostitch which has higher commercial construction and industrial channel content than in consumer tools and storage however the majority of this segment is driven by consumer and residential construction channels which have largely stabilized key customer point of sale data remains steady segment profit declined 37 million attributable to the sales volume pressure the ongoing integration of the bostitch business into consumer tools and storage has generated efficiencies that significantly aided the segment profit rate recovery from a trough of 64 in the fourth quarter of 2008 the aforementioned bostitch integration along with other cost actions and productivity initiatives as well as the carryover effect of price increases and lower commodity costs enabled the 40 basis point improvement in the segment profit rate despite sharply lower sales 

cdiy net sales from continuing operations decreased 3 in 2008 from 2007 customer pricing increases in response to rising commodity costs in the first three quarters of 2008 contributed 3 to sales foreign currency translation increased sales by 2 while organic volume declined 8 volume was negatively impacted by the contraction in residential construction in both the americas and europe reductions in consumer spending as well as a decline in industrial markets served by fastening systems reflecting increasingly weak macroeconomic conditions fastening systems continued its planned shift toward more profitable business which resulted in additional volume pressure the sales volume decline also partially pertained to the shutdown of the unprofitable consumer metal storage business europe had essentially flat unit volume in the first half of 2008 but declined significantly in the second half despite declines in unit volume cdiy retained focus on inventory levels and contributed a substantial part of the company’s total working capital improvement progress was made on executing customer pricing actions but these benefits were significantly outpaced by cost inflation contributing to the profit rate erosion the profit rate was also affected by lower sales volumes productivity projects and cost reduction actions partially mitigated these unfavorable impacts 

restructuring activities 

at january 2 2010 the company’s restructuring reserve balance was 464 million the vast majority of which is expected to be utilized in 2010 a summary of the restructuring reserve activity from january 3 2009 to january 2 2010 is as follows in millions

pre2009 actions during 2008 the company initiated cost reduction actions in order to maintain its cost competitiveness a large portion of these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter as the company responded to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and slowing global demand primarily in its cdiy and industrial segments severance charges of 700 million were recorded relating to the reduction of approximately 2700 employees in addition 136 million in charges were recognized related to asset impairments for production assets and real estate and 07 million for facility closure costs also 12 million in other charges stemmed from the termination of service contracts of the 855 million in full year 2008 restructuring and asset impairment charges 138 million 297 million 356 million and 64 million pertained to the security industrial and cdiy segments and nonoperating entities respectively during 2007 the company also initiated 118 million of cost reduction actions in various businesses entailing severance for 525 employees and the exit of a leased facility

acquisition related during 2009 27 million of reserves were established for acquisitions consummated in the latter half of 2008 primarily related to the consolidation of security monitoring call centers of this amount 10 million was for the severance of approximately 90 employees and 17 million related to the closure of a branch facility primarily from remaining lease obligations in 2009 27 million of severance reserves previously established in purchase accounting that are no longer needed were reversed to goodwill the company utilized 57 million of the restructuring reserves during 2009 established for previous acquisitions as of january 2 2010 66 million in acquisitionrelated accruals remain those accruals are expected to be utilized predominantly in 2010 

financial condition 

liquidity sources and uses of capital the company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities 

operating and investing activities the company has consistently generated strong operating cash flows over many years in 2009 cash flow from operations totaled 539 million up over 22 million compared to 2008 working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable generated 226 million of cash inflows driven by inventory and accounts receivable reductions which were partially offset by lower accounts payable these working capital reductions while partially attributable to lower sales volumes were engendered by broadly practiced sfs disciplines including effective sales and operations planning a deliberate focus on reducing slow moving inventories and vigilant receivable collections additionally the company implemented a receivable securitization facility in december 2009 which enabled a 35 million cash inflow this strong working capital performance is apparent from the improvement in working capital turns from 59 in 2008 to a record 79 at yearend 2009 cash outflows for restructuring activities totaled 58 million in 2009 an increase of 25 million over 2008 arising from the significant cost reduction actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 as the company rightsized its cost structure amidst sales pressures associated with weak macroeconomic conditions 

in 2008 cash flow from operations totaled 517 million down 27 million compared to 2007 operating cash flow reflects a 46 million reduction for taxes paid on the gain from the cstberger divestiture even though the directly related gross proceeds are reported as an investing cash flow working capital generated 123 million of cash inflows driven by accounts receivables reflecting the disciplines of sfs and a concerted effort to reduce past due accounts and to a lesser extent inventory reductions cash outflows for restructuring activities totaled 33 million in 2008 a decrease of 25 million over 2007 primarily pertaining to cost reduction actions initiated in the fourth quarter and the continuing payments under the facom europe initiatives 

the other noncash element of cash provided by operating activities is comprised of various items including noncash gains on debt extinguishments inventory losses interest accretion on the convertible notes and loan cost amortization among other factors other noncash operating cash flows represent items necessary to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities 

capital expenditures were 93 million in 2009 141 million in 2008 and 87 million in 2007 the lower capital expenditures in 2009 pertain to reduced capitalized software investments and the prior year purchase of a previously leased distribution facility that did not reoccur the higher capital expenditures in 2008 as compared with 2007 were primarily attributable to investment in the north american sap information system implementation and the aforementioned purchase of a distribution facility 

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 446 million in 2009 422 million in 2008 and 457 million in 2007 considerably exceeding net earnings management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners in 2008 free cash flow also excludes the income taxes paid on the cstberger divestiture due to the fact the taxes are nonrecurring and the directly related gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the company’s common stock and business acquisitions among other items 

 

based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at january 2 2010 the company believes over the long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareholders’ advantage through a combination of acquisitions dividends debt repayment and potential future share repurchases the company expects free cash flow in 2010 to be approximately 300 to 350 million which assumes a modest improvement in working capital turns from 2009 yearend levels 

this forecast represents approximately a 100 to 150 million reduction from the 2009 free cash flow primarily because the 20 times improvement in working capital turns achieved in 2009 as reflected in the 226 million increase in current year free cash flow will not repeat to the same extent in 2010 the projected 2010 free cash flow is more than sufficient to meet the company’s requirements for funding the stock dividend debt service and other matters 

in 2009 the company expended 24 million for several small acquisitions in 2008 acquisition spending totaled 575 million mainly for the gdp scan modul sonitrol and xmark businesses within the security segment 2007 acquisition spending amounted to 643 million primarily pertaining to the hsm innerspace and bedcheck businesses 

investing cash flows aside from the previously discussed capital expenditures and acquisitions were minor in 2009 such other investing cash flows in 2008 include 205 million in gross proceeds from sales of businesses after transaction costs primarily pertaining to the divestiture of the cstberger laser measuring tool business in july 2008 as previously mentioned the 46 million of income taxes paid on the gain are reported as an operating cash outflow and thus the total cash inflow from the 2008 divestitures amounts to 159 million 

on february 27 2008 the company amended its credit facility to provide for an increase and extension of its committed credit facility to 800 million from 550 million in may 2008 the company’s commercial paper program was also increased to 800 million the credit facility is diversified amongst thirteen financial institutions the credit facility is designated as a liquidity backstop for the company’s commercial paper program the amended and restated facility expires in february 2013 as of january 2 2010 there were no outstanding loans under this facility and the company had 87 million of commercial paper outstanding in addition the company has uncommitted shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 197 million of which 188 million was available at january 2 2010 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal aggregate credit lines total 997 million of which 90 million was utilized and reported as outstanding shortterm borrowings as of january 2 2010

in 2008 the company utilized the proceeds from the 250 million of longterm debt issued in september 2008 as well as the 159 million in net proceeds from divestitures to repay shortterm borrowings which was partially offset by the cash outflows for business acquisitions and other matters net proceeds from shortterm borrowings totaled 192 million in 2007 and the cash inflows were used to fund acquisitions and repurchases of common stock

in november 2008 the company repurchased 10 million of the equity units for 53 million in cash to properly account for the transaction the equity unit elements were bifurcated as effectively the company paid 10 million to extinguish the convertible notes and received 47 million from the seller to settle its obligation under the forward stock purchase contracts to purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a minimum purchase price of approximately 5423 per share on may 17 2010 at the repurchase date the company’s common stock had a closing market value of 2538 the remaining liability for fees payable associated with the 10 million of settled forward stock purchase contracts was reversed resulting in an increase to equity of 07 million the related 10 million in convertible note hedges and stock warrants which are described further below were unwound with a nominal impact to equity as a result of the various elements associated with the 10 million equity unit repurchase transaction there was an insignificant gain recorded in earnings and a net increase in equity of 54 million 

the convertible notes are pledged and held as collateral to guarantee the equity unit investors’ obligation to purchase shares in may 2010 under the stock purchase contracts the convertible notes reflect a conversion price of approximately 6450 or a 19 premium as of the date of issuance at maturity the company must repay the convertible note principal in cash additionally to the extent that the conversion option is “in the money” the company at its election will deliver either cash or shares of common stock based on a conversion rate and the applicable market value of the company’s common stock at that time a maximum of approximately 59 million shares may be issued in may 2010 under the stock purchase contracts essentially at the higher of approximately 5423 or market value at that time 

the company simultaneously entered into related convertible note hedge and stock warrant transactions with financial institutions share dilution pertaining to the conversion option of the convertible notes will occur in interim periods if the share price exceeds approximately 6450 

at maturity in 2012 the convertible note hedge will offset the potentially dilutive impact of the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes because the convertible note hedge is antidilutive it will not be included in any diluted shares outstanding computation prior to its maturity however at maturity the aggregate effect of the convertible notes and the convertible note hedge is that there will be no net increase in the company’s common shares the company also issued unregistered stock warrants that are exercisable during the period august 17 2012 through september 28 2012 the 49 million stock warrants outstanding as of january 2 2010 have a strike price of 8683 subject to standard antidilution protection for increases in the dividend rate stock splits etc in the event the stock warrants become “in the money” during their 5 year term due to the market value of the company’s common stock exceeding the strike price there will be a related increase in diluted shares outstanding utilized in the determination of diluted earnings per share 

the combined terms of the convertible note hedge stock warrants and convertible notes in substance reestablish the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes at 60 above the 5423 market value of the company’s common stock such that in effect the company will retain the benefits of share price appreciation if any up to a market value equal to the stock warrant strike price additionally the company will retain benefits of share price appreciation if any through the maturity of the stock purchase contract element of the equity units that will entail issuance of 320 million of common shares at the higher of approximately 5423 or market price in may 2010 refer to note h longterm debt and financing arrangements for further detail

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options purchased options and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into crosscurrency swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2009 would have been approximately an 8 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all derivative currency positions this effect would occur from an appreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause a “transactional” impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars as previously discussed it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 025 per diluted share with respect to transactional foreign currency market risk the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the chinese rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases which could adversely impact profitability in the event significant rmb or other currency appreciation occurs the company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps 

the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor and euribor rates at january 2 2010 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects in 2009 the company experienced much less significant commodity energy and wage inflation than in the past few years however such inflation increased costs by approximately 140 million in 2008 and 67 million in 2007 which management mitigated to a large extent through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives management presently expects inflation in 2010 to be recovered through customer pricing and as a result it is not anticipated that such “net” inflation will have a material adverse impact on 2010 earnings however if commodity prices increase in the future there would be an unfavorable impact on earnings to the extent not recovered through pricing and other actions 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of mda additionally the company has 21 million of liabilities as of january 2 2010 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years this is exemplified by the fact that while there was a 48 million gain on pension plan assets in 2009 and a 71 million loss on pension plan assets in 2008 associated with volatile financial markets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans will modestly decrease to approximately 17 million in 2010 as compared with 20 million in 2009 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 

the company has the flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its etps obligation for up to 5 years while there can be no guarantee of the future the company has an investmentgrade credit rating and has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the commercial paper and bank markets throughout the recent credit crunch further the company has not encountered liquidity difficulties historically when similar credit tightening has occurred due to macroeconomic issues moreover the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an employee stock ownership plan “esop” under which the ongoing us cornerstone and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop activity amounted to income of 8 million in 2009 and 11 million and 2 million of expense in 2008 and 2007 respectively the esop income in 2009 stems from the suspension of the cornerstone benefits and the reduction of the 401k match as a percentage of employee contributions as part of cost saving actions the company has reinstated these benefits for 2010 and expects there will be an increase in expense in 2010 more aligned with 2008 and prior years the increase in expense in 2008 versus 2007 was mostly attributable to the average market value of shares released which decreased from 5604 in 2007 to 4365 in 2008 as well as increased benefits pertaining to the headcount expansion from acquisitions esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

customerrelated risks the company has significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are none that exceed 6 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

there are no individually material credit exposures from particular customers while the company has strong credit policies and disciplined management of receivables due to weak economic conditions or other factors it is reasonably possible that certain customers’ creditworthiness may decline and losses from receivable writeoffs may increase 

new accounting standards refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position 

critical accounting estimates preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if writedowns are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value further writedowns would be recorded 

property plant and equipment the company generally values property plant and equipment “ppe” at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company recorded 7 million in asset impairment losses in 2009 primarily as a result of restructuring initiatives and such losses may occur in the future 

goodwill and intangible assets the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 35020 “goodwill” acquired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists other intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate the company completed acquisitions in 2009 and 2008 valued at 24 million and 572 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 1818 billion of goodwill and 305 million of indefinitelived trade names at january 2 2010 

in accordance with asc 35020 management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is a reportable operating segment as defined in asc 280 “segment reporting” or one level below a reportable operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a reportable operating segment having similar economic characteristics the company has seven reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value an impairment may exist an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are nearterm revenue growth rates over the next five years these assumptions contemplate business market and overall economic conditions the fair value of indefinitelived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model the key assumptions used include discount rates royalty rates and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales 

as required by the company’s policy goodwill and indefinitelived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2009 based on this testing the company determined that the fair value of its reporting units and indefinitelived trade names exceeded their carrying values the discount rate used in testing goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of 2009 was 105 for all reporting units the nearterm revenue growth rates and the perpetual growth rates which varied for each reporting unit ranged from 1 to 9 and 2 to 5 respectively in 2009 as compared with 2008 in consideration of market conditions the discount rate assumption increased 100 basis points and perpetual growth rates decreased 100 basis points in some reporting units which had the effect of reducing the estimated fair values management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate perpetual and nearterm revenue growth rates in all reporting units the discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the perpetual growth rates were decreased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated the nearterm revenue growth rates were reduced by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated based upon our 2009 annual impairment testing analysis including our consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 

in the event that our operating results in the future do not meet current expectations management based upon conditions at the time would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability accordingly the above sensitivity analysis while a useful tool should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 

environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 

as of january 2 2010 the company had reserves of 30 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 16 million to 52 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 

income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards is 49 million at january 2 2010 the company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of january 2 2010 amounted to 24 million 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information which involves inherent uncertainty for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk insurance to manage its insurance costs efficiently the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than 5 million per occurrence and 27 million in the aggregate the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of approximately 8 to 10 years the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves totaling 42 million and 45 million as of january 2 2010 and january 3 2009 respectively are adequate due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 67 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of january 2 2010 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

synthetic leases the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet 

these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 15 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2009 as of january 2 2010 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 51 million and 44 million respectively

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the company’s the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines in that segment certain large customers offer private label brands “house brands” that compete across a wider spectrum of the company’s cdiy segment product offerings the company is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world the company is a significant manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners for the construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroad utilities and public works the company also believes that it is among the largest direct providers of access security integration and alarm monitoring services in north america 

 

customers 

 

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain of the larger home centers or mass merchants as customers could have a material adverse effect on the company until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has been able to maintain a diversified customer base and has decreased customer concentration risk over the past years as sales from continuing operations in markets outside of the home center and mass merchant distribution channels have grown at a greater rate through a combination of acquisitions and other efforts to broaden the customer base primarily in the security and industrial segments in this regard sales to the company’s largest customer as a percentage of total sales have decreased from 22 in 2002 to 6 in 2008 

 

within the security segment a large portion of sales are generated in the retail sector the security segment also has significant sales to commercial governmental and educational customers

backlog 

 

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the company’s cdiy and industrial segment businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 2 2009 the company had approximately 348 million in unfilled orders all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year as of february 2 2008 unfilled orders amounted to 368 million 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

no business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments the company owns numerous patents none of which individually is material to the company’s operations as a whole these patents expire at various times over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the company’s operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in duration but generally run from one to 40 years

environmental regulations 

 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

 

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including fifteen active superfund sites current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the company’s volumetric contribution at these sites 

 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal 

information that becomes available as of january 3 2009 the company had reserves of 29 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable 

 

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

 

employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled “cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

 

if the current weakness continues in the housing and construction markets in the americas europe or asia or general recessionary conditions worsen it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

approximately 37 of 2008 sales were in the construction and doityourself segment and 29 in the industrial segment the company experienced 10 sales unit volume declines in existing businesses ie excluding acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 7 in the third quarter primarily in these segments as the recession spread worldwide the company’s business has been adversely affected by the decline in the us and international economies particularly with respect to housing and general construction markets it is 

possible this softness will be prolonged and to the extent it persists there is likely to be an unfavorable impact on sales earnings and cash flows it is possible the security segment which thus far has not experienced significant recessionrelated volume declines may become more affected if the recessionary impacts permeate other market sectors particularly construction within the retail sector further deterioration of these housing and construction markets and general economic conditions could reduce demand for company products and therefore have a material adverse effect on sales earnings and cash flows in addition due to current economic conditions it is possible certain customers’ creditworthiness may erode resulting in increased writeoffs of customer receivables 

 

the company’s growth and repositioning strategies include acquisitions the company’s recent acquisitions may not further its strategies and the company may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates 

 

in 2002 the company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth markets through acquisitions and divestitures and thereby reduce the risk associated with large customer concentrations the strategy has been advanced over the last several years with the sales of the company’s cstberger laser measuring residential entry door and home décor businesses and the acquisition of a number of companies including general de protection “gdp” xmark corporation “xmark” sonitrol corporation “sonitrol” hsm electronic protection services inc “hsm” facom sa “facom” national manufacturing co “national” besco pneumatic corporation “besco” blick plc “blick” frisco bay industries ltd “frisco bay” isr solutions inc “isr” security group inc “security group” and best lock corporation and its affiliates “best access” 

 

although the company has extensive experience with acquisitions there can be no assurance that recently acquired companies will be successfully integrated or that anticipated synergies will be realized if the company successfully integrates the acquired companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy there can be no assurance that its resulting business segments will enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability 

 

in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain the necessary financing complete the transactions or successfully integrate the new companies as necessary to continue its growth and repositioning strategies 

 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

 

the company has made a number of acquisitions in the past three years including but not limited to gdp in october 2008 sonitrol and xmark in july 2008 innerspace in july 2007 hsm in january 2007 besco in july 2006 and facom in january 2006 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

 

  

any intangible assets that the company acquires may have a negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed in addition the success of the company’s future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to 

 

  

failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of gdp xmark sonitrol innerspace and other acquisitions with its existing businesses and 

operations the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

 

the company may incur significant additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with future acquisitions which may restrict the manner in which it conducts business the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

 

as more fully described in item 7 and note i longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company issued 450 million of enhanced trust preferred securities through its trust subsidiary in 2005 the net proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the acquisitions of facom and national in march 2007 the company completed concurrent offerings of floating rate equity units and 5 senior notes due 2010 the net proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of hsm in addition the company has a revolving credit agreement expiring in february 2013 enabling borrowings up to 800 million this agreement includes provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to 250 million in euros and pounds sterling which may be available to among other things fund acquisitions 

 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include among other things 

 

  

future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions that affect the cost of raw materials freight energy labor and sourced finished goods 

 

the company’s products are manufactured of both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel aluminum zinc brass nickel and copper as well as resin additionally the company uses other commodity based materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight energy and labor the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors as described in more detail in item 7 hereto the company has been negatively impacted by inflation in recent years if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected conversely in the event there is deflation the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base through negotiations with suppliers or other measures to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows 

 

tightening of capital and credit markets could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s or its customers’ ability to borrow or otherwise obtain cash 

 

the company’s growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product 

lines while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption in late 2008 and early 2009 which could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on the company’s business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company’s products andor customer insolvencies and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the company’s treasury operations 

 

 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global operations enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weightedaverage exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted this occurred in the latter half of 2008 and is expected to persist in 2009 although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its nonus dollar earnings 

 

the company sources many products from china and other asian lowcost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the 7 appreciation of the rmb which occurred in both 2007 and 2008 has not generated material cost increases for products sourced from china further significant appreciation of the rmb or other currencies in countries where the company sources product could adversely impact profitability the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted 

 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods components and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets such as the us or the european union or make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company’s competitors source products 

 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and 

shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

 

large customer concentrations and related customer inventory adjustments may negatively impact sales results of operations and cash flows 

 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers although no one customer represents more than 10 of consolidated net sales the loss or material reduction of business from or the lack of success of sales initiatives for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

 

in addition unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales for example severe inventory adjustments pertaining to reducing the number of weeks supply on hand taken by certain large north american home center customers in december 2005 negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 million versus normal levels significant impacts from customer inventory adjustments may reoccur in the future 

 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

a substantial portion of the company’s products in the cdiy and industrial segments are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived trade names or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

 

as a result of acquisitions the company has 1747 billion of goodwill 300 million of indefinitelived trade names and 557 million of definitelived intangible assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at january 3 2009 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived trade names have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company’s control such as worsening economic conditions technological change intensified competition or other matters causing a decline in expected future cash flows 

 

income tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company future tax law changes may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

 

the company is subject to income taxation in the us as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes 

effective also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial write down of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

 

as described in further detail in items 1 and 3 and note t contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors and franchisees intellectual property claims regulatory actions and environmental matters there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company’s product quality manufacturing requirements marketing standards and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized use of the company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees and increase litigation costs similarly failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue increased litigation andor damage to the company’s reputation and business there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations 

 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

 

the company faces active competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the us canada and western europe also certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to lowcost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

 

the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology system implementations or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other facilities 

 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

 

despite efforts to prevent such situations the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates management believes it has effective disaster recovery plans and that it is unlikely there would be more than a shortlived disruption to its computer and communication systems due to these physical concentrations of equipment or from potential occurrences of damage and interruption however it is reasonably possible that results could be adversely impacted if equipment outages were prolonged due to an unusually serious event in addition the company is planning system conversions to sap to provide a common platform across most of its businesses the implementations from legacy systems to sap will occur in carefully managed stages over a period of several years in the americas and ultimately thereafter in europe and asia management believes the planned system conversions are costbeneficial and will further enhance productivity in its operations there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations 

 

the company’s operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities which are concentrated in various geographic locations if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss such as a fire or flood it could disrupt operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility the company maintains business interruption insurance but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating and other expenses certain us employee benefit plan expense is affected by the market value of the company’s common stock 

 

as described in further detail in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company sponsors pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans as well as an employee stock ownership plan “esop” under which the primary us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities bonds and other fixed income securities and money market instruments the company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans the company expects to contribute approximately 20 million to its pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans in 2009 

 

there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years during 2008 there was a 71 million loss on pension plan assets the fair value of these assets at january 3 2009 was 265 million 

 

overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop expense amounted to 11 million in 2008 and 2 million in both 2007 and 2006 the increase in expense was mostly attributable to the average market value of shares released which decreased from 4928 in 2006 to 4365 in 2008 however the company has discontinued the 401k and other defined contribution benefits in the esop for 2009 as part of its cost reduction initiatives and thus there will be a reduction in fiscal 2009 expense in the event these defined contribution benefits are offered again esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

 

the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable 

 

the company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and nontrade receivables there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could have an adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and operating results

business overview 

 

the company is a diversified worldwide supplier of tools and engineered solutions for professional industrial construction and doityourself “diy” use as well as engineered and security solutions for industrial and commercial applications its operations are classified into three business segments security industrial and construction  diy “cdiy” the security segment is a provider of access and security solutions primarily for retailers educational financial and healthcare institutions as well as commercial governmental and industrial customers the company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and electronic security products and systems and a variety of security services these include security integration systems software related installation maintenance monitoring services automatic doors door closers exit devices hardware and locking mechanisms security products are sold primarily on a direct sales basis and in certain instances through third party distributors the industrial segment manufactures and markets professional industrial and automotive mechanics tools and storage systems engineered healthcare storage systems assembly tools and systems plumbing heating and air conditioning tools hydraulic tools and accessories and specialty tools these products are sold to industrial customers and distributed primarily through third party distributors as well as direct sales forces the cdiy segment manufactures and markets hand tools consumer mechanics tools storage systems pneumatic tools and fastener products which are principally utilized in construction and doityourself projects these products are sold primarily to professional end users as well as consumers and are distributed through retailers including home centers mass merchants hardware stores and retail lumber yards 

 

for several years the company has pursued a diversification strategy to enable profitable growth the strategy involves industry geographic and customer diversification as exemplified by the expansion of security solution product offerings the growing proportion of sales outside the us and the deliberate reduction of the company’s dependence on sales to us home centers and mass merchants sales outside the us represented 43 of the total in 2008 up from 29 in 2002 sales to us home centers and mass merchants have declined from a high point of approximately 40 in 2002 to approximately 13 in 2008 execution of this strategy has entailed approximately 28 billion of acquisitions since the beginning of 2002 several divestitures and increased brand investments additionally the strategy reflects management’s vision to build a growth platform in security while expanding the valuable branded tools and storage platform over the past several years the company has generated strong free cash flow and received substantial proceeds from divestitures that enabled a transformation of the business portfolio 

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 422 million in 2008 457 million in 2007 and 359 million in 2006 considerably exceeding net earnings management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners in 2008 free cash flow also excludes the income taxes paid on the cstberger divestiture due to the fact the taxes are nonrecurring and the directly related gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the company’s common stock and business acquisitions among other items 

 

 

 

the company strives to reinvest its free cash flow in high return businesses in order to generate strong return on assets and improve working capital efficiency 

 

significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of the company’s diversification strategy as well as events impacting the company’s financial performance in 2008 and 2007 are discussed below 

 

continued growth of security business 

 

during 2008 the company further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry annual revenues of the security segment have grown to 1497 billion or 34 of 2008 sales up from 216 million or 10 of 2001 sales key events pertaining to the growth of this segment in the past year include the following 

 

  

several other smaller acquisitions were completed for a total purchase price of 49 million including access technologies distributors a mechanical lock business and security monitoring businesses the acquisitions complement the existing security segment product offerings increase its scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to customers as industry dynamics favor multisolution providers that offer “onestop shopping” the company continues to focus on integrating the acquired businesses as it expands the suite of security product and service offerings the sonitrol integration into hsm is well underway with the business sharing the same information technology platform while duplicative field offices are being eliminated the reverse integration of the company’s preexisting systems integration business into hsm progressed further in 2008 contributing to a 80 basis point expansion in the segment profit rate to 179 

drive further profitable growth in branded tools and storage 

 

while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion into security is important management recognizes that the branded construction  doityourself products and industrial businesses are the foundations on which the company was established and provide strong growth and cash flow generation prospects management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development brand support an increased weighting in emerging markets and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long term acquisitionrelated growth will also be pursued where appropriate two events in branded tools and storage are noteworthy 

 

  

continue to invest in the stanley brand 

 

stanley has an excellent portfolio of brands including stanley ®  facom ®  mac ®  proto ®  vidmar ®  bostitch ® and fatmax ®  the stanley ® brand is recognized as one of the world’s great brands and is one of the company’s most valuable assets brand support was increased over the past several years including television advertising campaigns associated with new product rollouts continued nascar racing sponsorships as well as print and outdoor advertising that generate approximately one billion brand impressions annually these advertising and marketing campaigns yielded strong results as evidenced by a 40 increase in stanley hand tool brand awareness since 2003 

 

institutionalize the stanley fulfillment system 

 

the company continued to practice the operating disciplines encompassed by the stanley fulfillment system “sfs” which is a transformation of processes systems and structure that enables improvements in operations and creates customer value the company employs lean value stream mapping and other continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations and drive improvements throughout the supply chain the foundation of sfs centers on lean common platforms sales and operations planning “sop” and complexity reduction benefits of sfs include reductions in lead times costs and working capital service level improvement and focus on employee safety the company applies sfs to many aspects of its business including maximizing customer fill rates through sop and acquisition integration sfs entails lean manufacturing disciplines and maximizing common platforms to drive operational excellence and asset efficiency the sfs program helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years it was instrumental in the reduction of working capital during 2008 and the 11 improvement in working capital turns to 59 in 2008 in 2009 and beyond the company plans to further leverage sfs to achieve higher working capital turns decreased cycle times reduced complexity in operations and increased customer service levels the company is also migrating toward common systems platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability to support its longterm acquisition growth strategy 

 

 

aside from the strategic commentary above other matters having a significant impact on the company’s results were inflation currency exchange rate fluctuations and share repurchases additionally the us recessionary environment and slowing global demand in the second half of 2008 necessitated significant cost reduction actions which will reduce the company’s cost structure in 2009 

the company has been negatively impacted by inflation primarily commodity and freight which has increased costs by an estimated 252 million over the past three years during this period more than twothirds of the cost increase was recovered through customer pricing actions and the remainder was mostly offset through various cost reduction initiatives inflationary trends have largely abated and are expected to be considerably less of a headwind in 2009 inflation is estimated at 30 million for the first half of 2009 due to the lagging nature of customer price increases the company expects a favorable carryover effect from previous customer pricing actions of approximately 30  50 million in 2009 

 

in recent years the strengthening of foreign currencies had a favorable impact on the translation of foreign currencydenominated operating results into us dollars the favorable impact of foreign currency translation including acquired companies contributed an estimated 09 18 and 04 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact either positive or negative on future earnings although the overall translation impact in 2008 was positive the us dollar strengthened in the second half of 2008 causing unfavorable effects that are expected to persist in 2009 refer to the market risk section of this mda for further discussion 

 

during 2008 and 2007 the company executed share repurchases of 22 million and 36 million outstanding shares of its common stock respectively for 100 million in 2008 and 200 million in 2007 the share repurchase benefit was partially offset by the issuance of 31 million shares of common stock under various employee plans over the two year period and also by higher interest expense associated with shortterm borrowings made to finance the share repurchases 

 

in response to the continued decline in the us housing market combined with deteriorating global demand in the second half of 2008 the company took actions to reduce its cost structure and recognized 86 million in pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges or 080 per diluted share the pretax earnings benefit from the cost actions implemented both at midyear 2008 and in conjunction with the restructuring announced on december 11 2008 is expected to total approximately 195 million or 175 per diluted share in 2009 with an additional 24 per share benefit in 2010 the company likely will incur 2009 restructuring and related charges of approximately 40  50 million pretax for certain productivity initiatives and the continued rationalization of its manufacturing footprint inclusive of approximately 10 million in carryover charges pertaining to the actions announced in december 2008 

 

results of operations 

 

below is a summary of the company’s operating results at the consolidated level followed by an overview of business segment performance the terms “organic” and “core” are utilized to describe results aside from the impact of acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods 

 

net sales net sales from continuing operations were 4426 billion in 2008 as compared to 4360 billion in 2007 a 2 increase as a result of significant commodity inflation the company increased pricing on its products and services which provided a 3 sales benefit in 2008 sales growth related to acquisitions principally from sonitrol gdp and other small security segment acquisitions contributed nearly 4 in higher sales organic unit volume decreased 6 while favorable foreign currency translation in all regions increased sales 1 versus the prior year the organic unit volume decline reflects deteriorating economic conditions which spread from the us to other regions in the second half of 2008 sequentially organic unit volume was down 4 for the first half of 2008 associated with the contraction in the us residential construction market and declined 7 and 10 in the third and fourth quarters respectively the cdiy segment unit volume was most affected by the economic downturn in the industrial segment the us based automotiverelated businesses suffered sharp declines which were partially offset by strength in industrial storage aside from the hardware business which had lower sales pertaining to the loss of a major customer in 2007 the security segment had positive organic sales volume for the year reflecting solid demand in its diversified end markets 

 

net sales from continuing operations were 4360 billion in 2007 as compared to 3897 billion in 2006 a 12 increase acquisitions contributed 7 or 263 million of the sales increase organic volume and pricing 

both increased 1 while favorable foreign currency translation in all regions increased sales 3 versus the prior year strong performance in the industrial segment particularly by the hydraulic and mechanics tools businesses was supplemented by more modest gains in the cdiy and security segments cdiy achieved robust growth internationally that was partially offset by weakness in the us associated with housing market declines in the security segment solid gains by the automatic door and mechanical lock businesses as well as overall pricing actions more than compensated for lower sales in the legacy electronic security integration business as it shed unprofitable equipment installations 

 

gross profit the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1671 billion or 38 of net sales in 2008 compared to 1653 billion or 38 of net sales in 2007 the acquired businesses increased gross profit by 77 million and were modestly accretive to the gross margin rate core gross profit for 2008 was 1594 billion or 37 of net sales down 59 million or 60 basis points from the prior year the security segment achieved gross profit expansion associated with the higher monitoring services sales mix emanating from the reverse integration of the legacy security integration business into hsm however this was more than offset by gross profit declines in the cdiy and industrial segments reflecting sales volume pressures aggregate pricing and productivity actions in 2008 largely offset 140 million of material energy and wage cost inflation as previously mentioned the company expects such inflation will increase first half 2009 costs by 30 million which management plans to mitigate through the carryover effect from previous customer pricing actions while it appears likely that inflationary effects may subside in the second half of 2009 

 

the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1653 billion or 38 of net sales in 2007 compared to 1413 billion or 36 of net sales in 2006 the acquired businesses increased gross profit by 136 million core gross profit for 2007 was 1517 billion or 37 of net sales up 104 million from the prior year the core gross margin rate expanded on strong performances from certain industrial segment businesses primarily facom and mechanics tools as well as the absence of 22 million of inventory stepup amortization from the initial turnover of acquired inventory in 2006 this was partially offset by a decline in the cdiy segment gross margin rate mainly from unrecovered cost inflation in addition the legacy security integration business had lower margins on certain equipment installations price and productivity actions in 2007 more than offset 67 million of material energy and wage cost inflation 

 

sga expense selling general and administrative expenses inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts were 1108 billion or 25 of net sales in 2008 as compared with 1038 billion or 24 of net sales in 2007 acquired companies contributed 46 million of the increase the remaining 24 million increase is largely attributable to foreign exchange impact higher bad debt expense and strategic investments including those to foster growth in emerging markets partially offset by benefits from the cost reduction initiatives previously mentioned 

 

selling general and administrative expenses were 1038 billion or 24 of net sales in 2007 consistent with the 24 of sales represented by 932 million of expense in 2006 acquired companies contributed 70 million of the increase and the remaining 36 million increase is largely attributable to foreign currency translation 

 

interest and othernet net interest expense from continuing operations in 2008 was 73 million compared to 80 million in 2007 the decrease is primarily due to lower applicable interest rates on commercial paper borrowings in 2008 the remainder of the decrease predominantly relates to repayment of 150 million of debt that matured in november 2007 partially offset by interest expense on 250 million of term debt issued in september 2008 

 

net interest expense from continuing operations in 2007 was 80 million compared to 65 million in 2006 the higher interest expense stems from borrowings necessary to fund the january 2007 acquisition of hsm refer to the financial condition section for additional discussion of the hsm acquisition financing 

 

othernet from continuing operations totaled 104 million of expense in 2008 compared to 87 million of expense in 2007 the increase mainly relates to higher intangible asset amortization expense due to recent acquisitions as well as currency losses partially offset by a 9 million gain on extinguishment of debt 

othernet from continuing operations totaled 87 million of expense in 2007 compared to 54 million of expense in 2006 the increase pertained primarily to higher intangible asset amortization expense due to recent acquisitions 

 

income taxes the company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 25 in both 2008 and 2007 compared to 20 for 2006 the lower effective tax rate in 2006 primarily relates to benefits realized upon resolution of tax audits that did not reoccur the effective income tax rate may vary in future periods based on the distribution of foreign earnings or changes in tax law in the jurisdictions where the company operates among other factors 

 

discontinued operations the 88 million of net earnings from discontinued operations in 2008 is attributable to the 84 million net gain from the sale of the cstberger business along with three other small businesses divested in 2008 and also reflects the operating results of these businesses through the dates of disposition the 11 million of net earnings from discontinued operations reported in both 2007 and 2006 reflects the operating results of cstberger and the aforementioned other minor businesses 

 

business segment results 

 

the company’s reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products services and end markets among other factors the company utilizes segment profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and sga aside from corporate overhead expense and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of sga interest income interest expense othernet inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense restructuring and asset impairments and income tax expense corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense cost for the executive management team and the expense pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire company but are not directly attributable to the businesses such as legal and corporate finance functions refer to note p restructuring and asset impairments and note g goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments and intangibles amortization expense respectively attributable to each segment as discussed previously the company’s operations are classified into three business segments security industrial and construction and doityourself “cdiy” 

 

security 

 

 

 

security segment sales increased 7 in 2008 primarily driven by acquisitions notably sonitrol and gdp which contributed 9 customer price increases amounted to 3 while foreign currency and organic volume declined 1 and 4 respectively the hardware business posted significant volume declines associated with the loss of a major customer in late 2007 aside from hardware the security segment had an increase in organic volume reflecting solid demand from its welldiversified customer base and associated recurring monthly revenues from service contracts for security monitoring and system maintenance the access technologies and mechanical lock businesses delivered organic sales growth pertaining to modest volume increases and disciplined recovery of inflation through customer pricing actions the reverse integration of the usbased legacy security integration business as well as the integration of the july 2008 sonitrol acquisition into hsm provided cost synergies and fostered a 80 basis point expansion of the segment profit rate the segment profit improvement was also attributable to strong execution of productivity projects partially offset by the impact of the previously discussed hardware business sales volume decline 

 

security segment sales increased 24 in 2007 hsm and other acquisitions contributed 21 while price grew 3 currency 2 and organic volume declined 2 organic sales gains in automatic doors and mechanical locks were achieved on the strength of national and strategic account growth while the hardware business demonstrated resilience in recovering from the loss of a key customer effective pricing actions to recover 

inflation in raw material costs also contributed to sales growth in the segment shrinkage in the legacy us security integration “ussi” business’ sales and segment profit was a necessary byproduct of a business model change entailing a shift away from low profitability equipment installation to an emphasis on higher margin recurring service revenues the reverse integration of ussi into hsm with its superior bidding and project management disciplines progressed well the broader security segment product line enabled the company to compete more effectively in the architectural bidding process to attain gains in commercial construction markets the 2007 segment profit rate showed a strong expansion of 210 basis points over 2006 this improvement was attributable to hsm the nonrecurring inventory stepup amortization for the national hardware acquisition recorded in 2006 the benefits of a partial shift in hardware production to asia and overall pricing and productivity in excess of inflation these positive factors were partially offset by the previously discussed decline in the legacy security integration businesses

industrial segment net sales increased 2 in 2008 versus 2007 attributable to the innerspace and scan modul healthcare storage acquisitions foreign currency translation provided a 3 benefit and favorable pricing 2 which were offset by a 5 unit volume decline the north american automotive repair business was adversely affected by distributor attrition and the deteriorating us economy european sales volumes which had been positive in the first half of the year declined in the second half as facom and other businesses reflected the contraction of the european economy these volume declines were partially offset by strong sales growth in usbased engineered storage and to a lesser extent the hydraulic tools business the sales growth in engineered storage was driven by government spending particularly by army and navy bases and also strength with commercial customers the sales volume declines created substantial headwinds from unfavorable manufacturing plant absorption causing a decrease in the segment profit strong focus on customer pricing and productivity initiatives more than offset the effects of inflation additionally the benefits of cost reduction actions partially mitigated the unfavorable impact of sales volume declines on segment profit 

 

industrial segment net sales increased 10 in 2007 from 2006 comprised of a 4 volume increase a 4 favorable foreign currency impact 1 favorable pricing and 1 from the innerspace acquisition hydraulic tools and mechanics tools achieved robust sales increases along with strong performance from the facom and engineered storage businesses the hydraulic tools sales increase was attributable to sustained high demand for recent shear product offerings strong international sales and favorable steel scrap markets industrial mechanics tools benefited from strong demand in the us oil and gas industry the higher facom sales pertained to new product introductions and improved european economic conditions intensified marketing efforts including an expanded sales force contributed to the usbased engineered storage business growth segment profit as a percentage of net sales improved 380 basis points excluding the effect of the onetime inventory stepup charge from the initial turn of facom acquired inventory in 2006 segment profit increased 270 basis points customer price increases effectively offset the impact of cost inflation while productivity initiatives further contributed to the segment profit rate expansion additionally facom’s contribution to the higher segment profit rate reflected favorable currency translation and the benefits of acquisition integration actions 

 

cdiy 

 

 

cdiy net sales from continuing operations decreased 3 in 2008 from 2007 customer pricing increases in response to rising commodity costs in the first three quarters of 2008 contributed 3 to sales foreign currency translation increased sales by 2 while organic volume declined 8 volume was negatively impacted by the contraction in residential construction in both the americas and europe reductions in consumer spending as well as a decline in industrial markets served by fastening systems reflecting increasingly weak macroeconomic conditions fastening systems continued its planned shift toward more profitable business which resulted in additional volume pressure the sales volume decline also partially pertained to the shutdown of the unprofitable consumer metal storage business europe had essentially flat unit volume in the first half of 2008 but declined significantly in the second half despite declines in unit volume cdiy retained focus on inventory levels and contributed a substantial part of the company’s total working capital improvement progress was made on executing customer pricing actions but these benefits were significantly outpaced by cost inflation contributing to the profit rate erosion the profit rate was also dramatically affected by lower sales volumes and to a lesser extent strategic investments that will help generate future emerging markets growth productivity projects and cost reduction actions partially mitigated these unfavorable impacts 

 

cdiy net sales from continuing operations increased 5 in 2007 from 2006 foreign currency translation contributed 3 to the higher sales pricing 1 acquisitions 1 and organic volume remained flat the us was adversely impacted by the housing market contraction as repair and remodel activity declined along with new construction sales were very strong in canada europe australia and asia in particular for the consumer tools and storage business this positive international performance was bolstered by new product introductions including the fatmax ® xl™ line as well as favorable economic conditions outside the us fastening systems also experienced an overall decline in sales due to the us housing downturn although its industrial channel and office product sales remained stable during 2007 the company took actions to improve the fastening systems cost structure including a mexican plant closure and the first wave of a pneumatic tool production shift to asia enabled by the 2006 besco acquisition as a result fastening systems improved its margin rate slightly despite the lower sales volume the company completed the migration of a second wave of fastening systems tool production to asia during 2008 which further aided in reducing the cost structure the segment profit rate decline of 60 basis points in 2007 was mainly attributable to unrecovered cost inflation a product mix shift to lower margin tools along with a channel mix shift in the us and unfavorable absorption on inventory reductions these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and the previously mentioned improvement in the fastening systems business 

restructuring activities 

 

at january 3 2009 the restructuring reserve balance was 679 million a summary of the restructuring reserve activity and related charges from december 29 2007 to january 3 2009 is as follows 

 

 

 

2008 actions during 2008 the company initiated cost reduction initiatives in order to maintain its cost competitiveness a large portion of these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter as the company responded to deteriorating business conditions resulting from the recessionary us economic weakness and slowing global demand primarily in its cdiy and industrial segments severance charges of 700 million have been recorded relating to the reduction of approximately 2700 employees in addition to severance 136 million in charges were recognized pertaining to asset impairments for production assets and real estate and 07 million for facility closure costs the 12 million in other charges stemmed from the termination of service contracts of the amount recorded in 2008 298 million has been utilized to date for a remaining reserve as of january 3 2009 of 553 million the company will utilize a majority of these reserves in 2009 and estimates approximately 30 will be expended in 2010 primarily pertaining to the timing of approvals from european governmental agencies 

 

pre2008 actions during 2007 the company initiated 118 million of cost reduction actions in various businesses these actions were comprised of severance for 525 employees and the exit of a leased facility the remaining reserves were fully utilized in 2008 

 

acquisition related during 2008 64 million of reserves were established related to the company’s current year acquisitions of this amount 53 million was for severance and related costs for approximately 200 employees and 11 million related to the closure of nine branch facilities as of january 3 2009 22 million has been utilized leaving 42 million remaining the company also utilized 125 million of restructuring reserves during 2008 established for various prior year acquisitions principally facom and hsm as of january 3 2009 84 million in accruals remain for the prior year acquisitions of this balance approximately 7 million pertains to facom for which the timing of payments depends upon the actions of certain european governmental agencies 

restructuring and asset impairment charges by segment were as follows 

 

 

 

of the 356 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges noted above for the cdiy segment 136 million is for asset impairments related to the current and planned closure of several facilities there were no asset impairments for the security and industrial segments in 2008 fair value for impaired production assets was based on the present value of discounted cash flows this included an estimate for future cash flows as production activities are phased out as well as auction values prices for similar assets for assets where use has been discontinued or future cash flows are minimal real estate values were based on estimates of anticipated sales values less costs to sell which contemplated sales of comparable properties and estimates from third party brokers 

 

financial condition 

 

liquidity sources and uses of capital the company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities 

 

operating and investing activities the company has consistently generated strong operating cash flows over many years in 2008 cash flow from operations totaled 517 million down 27 million compared to 2007 operating cash flow reflects a 46 million reduction for the taxes paid on the gain from the cstberger divestiture even though the directly related gross proceeds are reported as an investing cash flow working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable generated 123 million of cash inflows driven by accounts receivables reflecting the disciplines of sfs and a concerted effort to reduce past due accounts and to a lesser extent inventory reductions cash outflows for restructuring activities totaled 33 million in 2008 a decrease of 25 million over 2007 primarily pertaining to cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter and the continuing payments under facom europe initiatives 

 

in 2007 cash flow from operations totaled 544 million up 105 million compared to 2006 the favorable increase principally stems from an expansion of cash earnings and improved working capital performance in this regard the higher noncash intangibles amortization expense from acquisitions reduced earnings but not cash flows working capital generated 23 million of higher cash inflows in 2007 compared with 2006 this working capital improvement reflects leaner inventory positions achieved through process improvement efforts while maintaining customer service levels and was accomplished despite lower receivable sale proceeds in 2007 versus 2006 these favorable impacts were partially offset by cash outflows for restructuring activities which amounted to 58 million in 2007 an increase of 29 million over 2006 primarily pertaining to payments for the facom europe initiatives 

 

capital expenditures were 141 million in 2008 87 million in 2007 and 80 million in 2006 the higher capital expenditures in 2008 as compared with 2007 were primarily attributable to investment in the north american sap information system implementation and the purchase of a previously leased distribution facility the increase in 2007 capital expenditures versus 2006 pertained to investments for plant productivity improvements as well as ongoing information system spending for a major sap implementation in the americas 

 

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 422 million in 2008 457 million in 2007 and 359 million in 2006 considerably exceeding net earnings management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners in 2008 free cash flow also excludes the income taxes paid on the cstberger divestiture due to the fact the taxes are nonrecurring and the directly related gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows free 

cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the company’s common stock and business acquisitions among other items 

 

 

 

based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at january 3 2009 the company believes over the long term it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareholders’ advantage through a combination of acquisitions dividends debt repayment and potential future share repurchases if lower sales volumes and earnings pressures pertaining to the weakened global economy persist free cash flow may decrease in 2009 although continued efforts to improve working capital efficiency are expected to partially offset these headwinds as a result of the recessionary environment the company anticipates that in 2009 it may have lower acquisition and share repurchase activity and that free cash flow will likely be deployed for debt reduction to a greater extent than in the past few years 

 

in 2008 acquisition spending totaled 575 million mainly for the gdp scan modul sonitrol and xmark businesses 2007 acquisition spending amounted to 643 million primarily pertaining to the hsm innerspace and bedcheck businesses pursuant to its profitable growth strategy the company will continue to assess its current business portfolio for disposition opportunities and evaluate acquisition opportunities in favored markets while minimizing the risk associated with large customer concentrations 

 

investing cash flows include 205 million in gross proceeds from sales of businesses after transaction costs primarily pertaining to the divestiture of the cstberger laser measuring tool business in july 2008 as previously mentioned the 46 million of income taxes paid on the gain are reported as an operating cash outflow and thus the total cash inflow from the 2008 divestitures amounts to 159 million 

 

during 2006 the company entered into a saleleaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building under the terms of the transaction the company received 23 million in cash proceeds reported in investing cash flows and recorded a deferred gain of 11 million which will be amortized over the 15 year operating lease term the cash proceeds were utilized to pay down shortterm borrowings 

 

financing activities payments on longterm debt amounted to 45 million in 2008 228 million in 2007 and 4 million in 2006 net repayments of shortterm borrowings totaled 74 million in 2008 the company utilized the proceeds from the 250 million of longterm debt issued in september 2008 as well as the 159 million in net proceeds from divestitures to repay shortterm borrowings which was partially offset by the cash outflows for business acquisitions and other matters net proceeds from shortterm borrowings totaled 192 million in 2007 and the cash inflows were used to fund acquisitions and repurchases of common stock repayments of shortterm borrowings amounted to a cash outflow of 66 million in 2006 as commercial paper was paid down utilizing a portion of the strong operating cash flows 

 

on february 27 2008 the company amended its credit facility to provide for an increase and extension of its committed credit facility to 800 million from 550 million in may 2008 the company’s commercial paper program was also increased to 800 million the credit facility is diversified amongst thirteen financial institutions the credit facility is designated as a liquidity backstop for the company’s commercial paper program the amended and restated facility expires in february 2013 as of january 3 2009 there were no outstanding loans under this facility and the company had 206 million of commercial paper outstanding in addition the company has uncommitted shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 246 million of which 234 million was available at january 3 2009 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal aggregate credit lines amount to 1046 billion 

the company’s debt is currently rated by standard  poor’s “sp” moody’s investor service “moody’s” and fitch ratings “fitch” as of january 3 2009 the ratings for senior unsecured debt were a a2 and a by sp moody’s and fitch respectively each with a stable outlook on the company the shortterm debt or commercial paper ratings are a1 p1 and f1 by sp moody’s and fitch respectively on january 22 2009 moody’s placed the company’s debt under review for possible downgrade failure to maintain the current ratings level could adversely affect the company’s cost of funds liquidity and access to capital markets but would not have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to access the previously discussed 800 million committed credit facility 

 

on september 29 2008 the company issued 2500 million of unsecured term notes maturing october 1 2013 the “2013 term notes” with fixed interest payable semiannually in arrears at a rate of 615 per annum the 2013 term notes rank equally with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt the company received net proceeds of 2480 million which includes a discount of 05 million to achieve a 615 interest rate and 15 million of fees associated with the transaction the proceeds were utilized to repay shortterm borrowings 

 

the company increased its cash dividend per common share to 126 in 2008 dividends per common share increased 33 in 2008 34 in 2007 and 35 in 2006 

 

the company repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock in 2008 for 103 million an average cost of 4621 in 2007 the company repurchased 38 million shares of its common stock for 207 million an average of 5464 per share and in 2006 it repurchased 40 million shares for 202 million an average of 5007 per share 

 

the company initially funded the 546 million hsm acquisition with a combination of shortterm borrowings and cash a 500 million 364day revolving credit bridge facility was entered into on january 8 2007 of which 1300 million was utilized to acquire hsm the remainder of the hsm purchase price was funded through commercial paper borrowings and cash 

 

on march 20 2007 the company completed two security offerings “equity units” which consisted of 330 million of fiveyear convertible notes and 330 million of threeyear forward stock purchase contracts and 200 million of unsecured threeyear fixedrate term notes with respect to the 860 million in offerings the company will not receive the cash pertaining to the forward stock purchase contracts until may 2010 the 488 million net cash proceeds of these offerings and the related equity instruments described below were used to pay down the shortterm bridge facility and commercial paper borrowings 

 

in november 2008 the company repurchased 10 million of the equity units for 53 million in cash to properly account for the transaction the equity unit elements were bifurcated as essentially the company paid 10 million to extinguish the convertible notes and received 47 million from the seller to settle its obligation under the forward stock purchase contracts to purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a minimum purchase price of approximately 5445 per share on may 17 2010 at the repurchase date the company’s common stock had a closing market value of 2538 the remaining liability for fees payable associated with the 10 million of settled forward stock purchase contracts was reversed resulting in an increase to equity of 07 million the related 10 million in convertible note hedges and stock warrants which are described further below were unwound with a nominal impact to equity as a result of the various elements associated with the 10 million equity unit repurchase transaction there was an insignificant gain recorded in earnings and a net increase in equity of 54 million 

 

the convertible notes are pledged and held as collateral to guarantee the equity unit investors’ obligation to purchase shares in may 2010 under the stock purchase contracts the convertible notes reflect a conversion price of approximately 6480 or a 19 premium as of the date of issuance at maturity the company must repay the convertible note principal in cash additionally to the extent that the conversion option is “in the money” the company at its election will deliver either cash or shares of common stock based on a conversion rate and the applicable market value of the company’s common stock at that time a maximum of approximately 59 million shares may be issued in may 2010 under the stock purchase contracts essentially at the higher of approximately 5445 or market value at that time 

the company simultaneously entered into related convertible note hedge and stock warrant transactions with financial institutions share dilution pertaining to the conversion option of the convertible notes will occur in interim periods if the share price exceeds approximately 6480 at maturity in 2012 the convertible note hedge will offset the potentially dilutive impact of the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes because the convertible note hedge is antidilutive it will not be included in any diluted shares outstanding computation prior to its maturity however at maturity the aggregate effect of the convertible notes and the convertible note hedge is that there will be no net increase in the company’s common shares the company also issued 49 million of unregistered stock warrants that are exercisable during the period august 17 2012 through september 28 2012 with a strike price of 8712 subject to standard antidilution protection for increases in the dividend rate stock splits etc in the event the stock warrants become “in the money” during their 5 year term due to the market value of the company’s common stock exceeding the strike price there will be a related increase in diluted shares outstanding utilized in the determination of diluted earnings per share 

 

the combined terms of the convertible note hedge stock warrants and convertible notes in substance reestablish the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes at 60 above the 5445 market value of the company’s common stock at inception such that in effect the company will retain the benefits of share price appreciation if any up to a market value equal to the stock warrant strike price additionally the company will retain benefits of share price appreciation if any through the maturity of the stock purchase contract element of the equity units that will entail issuance of 320 million of common shares at the higher of approximately 5445 or market price in may 2010 refer to note i longterm debt and financing arrangements for further detail

market risk 

 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian british australian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi “rmb” and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments including purchased basket options purchased options and currency forwards the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into crosscurrency swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of 2008 would have been approximately a 9 million pretax loss based on a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all derivative currency positions this effect would occur from an appreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes the company does not hedge the translation of its nonus dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 

 

as mentioned above the company routinely has crossborder trade and affiliate flows that cause a “transactional” impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars as previously discussed it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take for example if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier as articulated in the company’s fourth quarter earnings release filed on form 8k on january 28 2009 if the us dollar were to remain at levels prevailing in midjanuary throughout fiscal 2009 including euro 134 canadian 084 pound sterling 150 and australian 069 then the combined unfavorable currency effect from both the translational and transactional aspects would be approximately 050 

in lower diluted earnings per share as compared with 2008 in that event the unfavorable impact would occur largely in the first half of 2009 management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a 10 overall movement in exchange rates is approximately 030 per diluted share with respect to transactional foreign currency market risk the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the 7 appreciation of the rmb during 2008 has not as yet generated material cost increases for products sourced from china further significant appreciation of the rmb or other currencies in countries where the company sources product could adversely impact profitability in the event significant rmb or other currency appreciation occurs the company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact 

 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor and euribor rates at january 3 2009 the impact of a hypothetical 10 increase in the interest rates associated with the company’s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects in 2008 the company experienced approximately 140 million of commodity energy and wage inflation most of which was recovered through favorable pricing actions such inflation increased costs by approximately 67 million in 2007 and 45 million in 2006 which management mitigated through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives if commodity prices further increase the company’s exposure could increase from the expected levels for 2009 as previously discussed 

 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of management’s discussion and analysis additionally the company has 14 million in unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is marktomarket exposure 

 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values although such funding would occur over a period of many years this is exemplified by the fact that while there was a 71 million loss on pension plan assets in 2008 associated with volatile financial markets the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans will modestly increase to approximately 20 million in 2009 as compared with 18 million in 2008 the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating the company has the flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its etps obligation for up to 5 years while there can be no guarantee of the future the company has an investmentgrade credit rating and has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the commercial paper and bank markets throughout the credit crunch that has recently arisen further the company has not encountered liquidity difficulties historically when similar credit tightening has occurred due to macroeconomic issues moreover the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered adequate to conduct business 

as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential further deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy 

 

other matters 

 

employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an employee stock ownership plan “esop” under which the ongoing us cornerstone and 401k defined contribution plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop expense amounted to 11 million in 2008 and was 2 million in both 2007 and 2006 the increase in expense was mostly attributable to the average market value of shares released which decreased from 4928 in 2006 to 4365 in 2008 as well as increased benefits pertaining to the headcount expansion from acquisitions esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines however the company has discontinued these benefits for 2009 as part of the cost actions taken and thus there will be a reduction in expense in fiscal 2009 

 

customerrelated risks the company has significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are none that exceed 6 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

 

there are no individually material credit exposures from particular customers while the company has strong credit policies and disciplined management of receivables due to weak economic conditions or other factors it is reasonably possible that certain customers’ creditworthiness may decline and losses from receivable writeoffs may increase 

 

new accounting standards refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position 

 

critical accounting estimates preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

 

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits “skus” to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly 

 

property plant and equipment the company generally values property plant and equipment “ppe” at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company recorded 14 million in asset impairment losses in 2008 primarily as a result of key restructuring programs and such losses may occur in the future 

 

goodwill and intangible assets the company completed acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 valued at 572 million and 646 respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 1747 billion of goodwill and 300 million of indefinitelived trade names at january 3 2009 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangible asset impairment involves the estimation of fair value impairment testing of goodwill also requires the identification and valuation of reporting units the estimates of fair value of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and related reporting units are based on the information available at the date of assessment including management assumptions about future cash flows discount rates and royalty rates which are utilized to estimate the present value of future cash flows to be generated by the indefinitelived assets future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with acquired entities while the company has not recorded goodwill or other intangible asset impairment losses in many years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event expected profitability cash flows or trade name usage change from current estimates this is particularly the case with respect to the convergent security solutions reporting unit which encompasses many recent acquisitions and the fastening systems reporting unit which continues to rationalize its cost structure deteriorating global economic conditions increase the risk that impairment losses may occur in the future 

 

environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites 

future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 

 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of january 3 2009 the company had reserves of 29 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 19 million to 51 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy while the company believes the 29 million liability recorded for environmental matters is adequate it is possible that future developments may require charges for environmental exposures in excess of this reserve 

 

income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards is 102 million at january 3 2009 the company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of january 3 2009 amounted to 25 million 

 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information when it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be asserted the company accrues its best estimate of the tax liability inclusive of related interest charges see note r income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

risk insurance to some extent the company self insures for various business exposures for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses “stop loss” insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers’ compensation and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance consultant form the basis for workers’ compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary contemplates the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists insurance companies for workers’ compensation and by inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for automobile and product liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected future claim payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of january 3 2009 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 66 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of january 3 2009 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability 

 

offbalance sheet arrangement 

 

synthetic leases the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the 16 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2008 as of january 3 2009 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 68 million and 58 million respectively

1c narrative description of business 

the company’s operations are classified into three business segments construction  doityourself industrial and security 

construction  diy 

the construction  doityourself ‘‘cdiy’’ segment manufactures and markets hand tools consumer mechanics tools storage systems pneumatic tools fasteners and electronic leveling and measuring tools these products are sold primarily to professional end users and distributed through retailers including home centers mass merchants hardware stores and retail lumber yards hand tools include measuring and leveling tools planes hammers demolition tools knives and blades screwdrivers saws chisels consumer tackers and staples as well as electronic leveling and measuring devices consumer mechanics tools include wrenches sockets metal tool boxes and cabinets storage units include plastic tool boxes and storage systems pneumatic tools and fasteners are used for construction remodeling furniture making pallet manufacturing and other applications involving the attachment of wooden materials electronic leveling and measuring tools include laser and optical leveling and measuring devices and accessories utilized primarily by contractors surveyors engineers and other professionals and doityourself individuals 

industrial 

the industrial segment manufactures and markets professional mechanics tools and storage systems plumbing heating air conditioning and roofing tools hydraulic tools and accessories assembly tools and systems and specialty tools stanley supply and services these products are sold to industrial customers and distributed primarily through third party distributors as well as through direct sales forces 

professional mechanics tools and storage include wrenches sockets electronic diagnostic tools tool boxes and highdensity industrial storage and retrieval systems plumbing heating air conditioning and roofing tools include pipe wrenches pliers press fitting tools and tubing cutters hydraulic tools and accessories include handheld hydraulic tools and accessories used by contractors utilities railroads and public works as well as mounted demolition hammers and compactors designed to work on skid steer loaders miniexcavators backhoes and large excavators assembly tools and systems include electric and pneumatic assembly tools these are high performance precision tools controllers and systems for tightening threaded fasteners used chiefly by vehicle manufacturers stanley supply and services distributes specialty tools for assembling repairing and testing electronic equipment 

security 

the security segment is a provider of access and security solutions primarily for retailers educational financial and healthcare institutions as well as commercial governmental and industrial customers the company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and electronic security products and systems and a variety of security services including security integration systems software related installation maintenance monitoring services automatic doors door closers exit devices hardware includes hinges gate hardware cabinet pulls hooks braces and shelf brackets and locking mechanisms security products are sold primarily on a direct sales basis as well as in certain instances through third party distributors 

competition 

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands its commitment to customer service strong customer relationships the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product innovation 

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the company’s the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines in that segment certain large customers offer private label brands ‘‘house brands’’ that compete across a wider spectrum of the company’s product offerings the company is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line of products than any other toolmaker the company is a significant manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners for the construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of handheld hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroad utilities and public works the company also believes that it is among the largest direct providers of access security integration and alarm monitoring services in north america 

several of the company’s largest retail customers have elected to compete with the company by developing house brands and sourcing competing products generally from low cost countries 

customers 

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain of the 

larger home centers or mass merchants as customers could have a material adverse effect on the company until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has been able to maintain a diversified customer base and has decreased customer concentration risk over the past years as sales from continuing operations in markets outside of the home center and mass merchant distribution channels have grown at a greater rate through a combination of efforts to broaden the customer base primarily in the security and industrial segments in this regard sales to the company’s largest customer as a percentage of total sales have decreased from 22 in 2002 to 8 in 2007 

raw materials 

the company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel aluminum zinc brass copper and nickel as well as resin additionally the company uses other commodity based materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the raw materials required are procured globally and available from multiple sources at competitive prices the company has annual or quarterly spot contracts with many of its preferred suppliers of raw material and energy certain commodity prices particularly energy related and nonferrous metals are expected to remain volatile in 2008 the company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or energy used in its production processes 

backlog 

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the company’s cdiy and industrial businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 2 2008 the company had approximately 368 million in unfilled orders compared with 347 million in unfilled orders at february 3 2007 all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result the company produces primarily for inventory rather than to fill specific orders 

patents and trademarks 

no business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments the company owns numerous patents none of which individually is material to the company’s operations as a whole these patents expire at various times over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the company’s operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in duration but generally run from one to 20 years 

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide the stanley ® and stanley in a notched rectangle design trademarks are material to all three business segments these wellknown trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are among the world’s most trusted brand names the company’s tagline ‘‘make something great ™ ’’ is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments the bostitch ®  atro ®  besco ®  powerlock ®  tape rule case design powerlock fatmax ®  fatmax ® xtreme ™  fatmax ® xl ™ cstberger ™  and zag ®  are material to the cdiy segment labounty ®  mac ®  proto ®  jensen ®  vidmar ®  blackhawk ™ by proto ®  national ®  facom ®  virax ® and usag ® trademarks are material to the industrial segment in the security segment the best ®  hsm ®  blick ®  frisco bay ®  safemasters ®  and sargent and greenleaf ® trademarks are material the terms of these trademarks vary typically from 10 to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms 

environmental regulations 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters 

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially responsible party ‘‘prp’’ in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including sixteen active superfund sites current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the company’s volumetric contribution at these sites 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of december 29 2007 the company had reserves of 30 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable 

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

employees 

at december 29 2007 the company had approximately 18400 employees nearly 9600 of whom were employed in the us approximately 800 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 17 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the company’s hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the company’s labor agreements in the us expire in 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the 

heading entitled ‘‘cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995’’ and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

continued deterioration of the us housing and construction markets or downturns in these markets in europe or asia could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

approximately 24 of 2007 sales were in the americas region in the construction and doityourself segment this portion of the company’s business has been adversely affected by the decline in the us housing and general construction markets though european and asian sales in this segment were robust in 2007 it is possible this softness in us markets will be prolonged and to the extent it persists there is likely to be an unfavorable impact on sales and earnings further deterioration of these domestic housing and construction markets in the americas or downturns in these markets in europe and asia could reduce demand for company products and therefore have a material adverse effect on sales and earnings in addition in the event economic conditions worsen it is possible certain customers’ creditworthiness may decline resulting in increased writeoffs of customer receivables 

the company’s growth and repositioning strategies include acquisitions the company’s recent acquisitions may not further its strategies and the company may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates 

in 2002 the company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth markets through acquisitions and divestitures and thereby reduce the risk associated with large customer concentrations the strategy has been advanced over the last five years with the sales of the company’s residential entry door and home décor businesses and the acquisition of a number of companies including hsm electronic protection services inc ‘‘hsm’’ facom sa ‘‘facom’’ national manufacturing co ‘‘national’’ besco pneumatic corporation ‘‘besco’’ best lock corporation and its affiliates ‘‘best access’’ chicago steel tape co and affiliates ‘‘cstberger’’ blick plc ‘‘blick’’ frisco bay industries ltd ‘‘frisco bay’’ isr solutions inc ‘‘isr’’ security group inc ‘‘security group’’ and precision hardware inc ‘‘precision’’ 

although the company has extensive experience with acquisitions there can be no assurance that recently acquired companies will be successfully integrated and effectively implement the company’s growth and repositioning strategy if the company successfully integrates the acquired companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy there can be no assurance that its resulting business segments will enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability 

in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain the necessary financing complete the transactions or successfully integrate the new companies as necessary to continue its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

the company has made a number of acquisitions in the past three years including but not limited to innerspace in july 2007 hsm in january 2007 besco in july 2006 facom in january 2006 national in november 2005 precision in may 2005 and security group in january 2005 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks including 

   any intangible assets that the company acquires may have a negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed in addition the success of the company’s future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to 

   failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of facom national besco hsm innerspace and other acquisitions with its existing businesses and operations the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized 

the company may incur significant additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with future acquisitions which may restrict the manner in which it conducts business the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as more fully described in item 7 and note i longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company issued 450 million of enhanced trust preferred securities through its trust subsidiary in 2005 the net proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the acquisitions of facom and national in march 2007 the company completed concurrent offerings of floating rate equity units and 5 senior notes due 2010 the net proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of hsm in addition the company has a five year revolving credit agreement enabling borrowings up to 550 million this agreement includes provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to 250 million in euros and pounds sterling which may be available to among other things fund acquisitions 

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that include among other things 

    future new instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies 

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflation in the cost of raw materials freight and energy 

the company’s products are manufactured of both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel aluminum zinc brass nickel and copper as well as resin additionally the company uses other commodity based materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products as described in more detail in item 7 hereto the company has been negatively impacted by commodity and freight inflation in recent years and it expects energy and certain commodity prices particularly nonferrous metals to increase if the company is unable to mitigate these inflation increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected 

further tightening of credit markets could adversely affect the company by limiting the company’s or its customers’ ability to borrow or otherwise obtain cash 

the company’s growth plans are dependent on among other things the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of 

existing product lines while the company has not encountered difficulties to date the tightening of credit markets could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions in addition a large portion of the company’s products are sold to professionals in the commercial construction industry to the extent a continued tightening of credit markets results in reduced commercial construction activity there could be an adverse impact on sales 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global operations enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi ‘‘rmb’’ in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its non us dollar earnings 

the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the 7 appreciation of the rmb during 2007 has not as yet generated material cost increases for products sourced from china further significant appreciation of the rmb or other currencies in countries where the company sources product could adversely impact profitability the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases 

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods components and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements bilateral actions or in some cases eg antidumping tariffs unilateral action in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports including restrictions on manufacturing operations or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business 

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets such as the us or the european union 

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition 

large customer concentrations and related customer inventory adjustments may negatively impact sales results of operations and cash flows 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers such as the home depot lowe’s and walmart although no one customer represents more than 10 of consolidated net sales the loss or material reduction of business from or the lack of success of sales initiatives for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

in addition unanticipated inventory adjustments by such customers can have a negative impact on sales for example severe inventory adjustments taken by certain large north american home center customers in december 2005 negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 million versus normal levels while the company did not experience such a significant impact from customer inventory adjustments in late 2006 or 2007 they may reoccur in the future 

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a substantial portion of the company’s products in the cdiy and industrial segments are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived tradenames or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of acquisitions the company has 15 billion of goodwill 322 million of indefinitelived tradenames and 393 million of definitelived intangible assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at december 29 2007 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived tradenames have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside the company’s control such as technological change intensified competition or other matters causing a decline in expected future cash flows if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived tradenames or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

ultimate income tax payments may differ from amounts currently recorded by the company future tax law changes may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the united states as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes effective also while a reduction in statutory rates would result in a favorable impact on future net earnings it would require an initial writedown of any deferred tax assets in the related jurisdiction 

the company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

as described in further detail in items 1 and 3 and note s contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors intellectual property claims regulatory actions and environmental matters there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid manage and defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities 

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact sales and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized imitation of its products or unauthorized use of its trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees as well as divert management time and attention there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations in addition the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow the company to protect its proprietary rights to the same extent as it is able to in the united states 

the company has trademark licensing programs and licensees may not comply with product quality manufacturing standards marketing and other requirements 

the company licenses certain of its trademarks to third parties for manufacturing marketing distribution and sale of various products while it enters into comprehensive licensing agreements with its licensees covering product design product quality sourcing manufacturing marketing and other requirements such licensees may not comply fully with those agreements noncompliance could include marketing products under the company’s brand names that do not meet its quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet the company’s supplier code of conduct these activities could harm brand equity reputation and business 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy 

the company faces active competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the united states canada and western europe also certain large customers offer private label brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins 

the stanley fulfillment system ‘‘sfs’’ is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key business processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected 

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to low cost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits 

the performance of the company’s businesses may suffer if its computer systems are disrupted or cease to operate effectively or if planned upgrades to computer systems are not implemented smoothly 

the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions computer systems are important to production planning customer service and order fulfillment among other businesscritical processes consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries 

despite efforts to prevent such situations the company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other matters power outages computer viruses or security breaches computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates management believes it has effective disaster recovery plans and that it is unlikely there would be more than a shortlived disruption to its computer systems due to these physical concentrations of computer equipment or from potential occurrences of damage and interruption however it is reasonably possible that results could be adversely impacted if equipment outages were prolonged due to an unusually serious event in addition the company is in the process of planning and implementing system conversions to sap version 60 ‘‘sap’’ to provide a common platform across most of its businesses the implementations from legacy systems to sap will occur in carefully managed stages over a period of three years in the americas and ultimately thereafter in europe and asia management believes the planned system conversions are costbeneficial and will further enhance productivity in its operations there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken if systems fail to function effectively or become damaged operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues any significant disruption in the company’s computer operations could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating and other expenses certain us employee benefit plan expense is affected by the market value of the company’s common stock 

as described in further detail in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company sponsors pension and other post retirement defined benefit plans as well as an employee stock ownership plan ‘‘esop’’ under which the primary us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities bonds and other fixed income securities and money market instruments the company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which 

require among other things that the company make cash contributions to underfunded pension plans the company expects to contribute approximately 15 million to its pension and other post retirement defined benefit plans in 2008 

there can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make significant additional cash contributions to the plans which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes or that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company 

overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop expense amounted to 2 million in each of the years 2007 2006 and 2005 while the average market value of shares released increased from 4641 in 2005 to 5604 in 2007 other elements of esop expense including a gradual reduction in the number of shares released annually from the trust offset the favorable impact of the higher share price esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

the company provides a 5 guaranteed rate of return on participant contributions made to the tax deferred 401k savings plan prior to july 1998 when all contributions were invested in stanley common stock the value of the shares purchased by participants prior to july 1998 along with the 5 cumulative guaranteed rate of return on stanley common stock is known as an investment protection account ‘‘ipa’’ beginning in july 1998 the investment options for plan participant contributions were enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in addition to the company’s common stock and there is no guaranteed rate of return to participants on any contributions made after that time the ipa guarantee is included in the actuarial valuation of the ongoing us pension plan payments related to the ipa guarantees if they have any value would be made to participants over a period of many years generally as they retire in the event the market value of stanley common stock declines below 4359 which is the stock price at which there was a settlement of this liability additional costs may be triggered by the ipa benefit guarantee

business overview 

the company is a diversified worldwide supplier of tools and engineered solutions for professional industrial construction and doityourself ‘‘diy’’ use as well as engineered solutions and security solutions for industrial and commercial applications its operations are classified into three business segments construction  diy ‘‘cdiy’’ industrial and security the cdiy segment manufactures and markets hand tools storage systems fasteners and electronic leveling and measuring tools as these products are principally utilized in construction and doityourself projects these products are sold primarily to professional end users and distributed through retailers including home centers mass merchants hardware stores and retail lumber yards the industrial segment manufactures and markets professional mechanics and storage systems plumbing heating air conditioning and roofing tools assembly tools and systems hydraulic tools and specialty tools stanley supply and services these products are sold to industrial customers and distributed primarily through third party distributors as well as direct sales forces the security segment is a provider of access and security solutions primarily for retailers educational financial and healthcare institutions as well as commercial governmental and industrial customers the company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and electronic security integration systems software related installation maintenance and a variety of security services including security monitoring services electronic integration systems software related installation and maintenance services automatic doors door closers exit devices hardware and locking mechanisms 

for several years the company has pursued a diversification strategy to enable profitable growth the strategy involves industry geographic and customer diversification as exemplified by the expansion of security solution product offerings the growing proportion of sales outside the us and the deliberate reduction of the company’s dependence on sales to us home centers and mass merchants execution of this strategy has entailed approximately 22 billion of acquisitions since the beginning of 2002 several divestitures and increased brand investments additionally the strategy reflects management’s vision to build a growth platform in security while expanding the valuable branded tools platform over the past several years the company has generated strong free cash flow and received substantial proceeds from divestitures that enabled a transformation of the business portfolio 

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 457 million in 2007 359 million in 2006 and 294 million in 2005 considerably exceeding net earnings management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the company’s common stock and business acquisitions among other items 

 

the company strives to reinvest its free cash flow in high return businesses in order to generate strong return on assets and improve working capital efficiency 

significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of the company’s diversification strategy as well as events impacting the company’s financial performance in 2007 and 2006 are discussed below 

continued growth of security business 

during 2007 the company further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry annual revenues of the security segment have grown to 1433 billion or 32 of 2007 sales up from 216 million or 10 of 2001 sales key events pertaining to the growth of this segment in the past year include the following 

   the above acquisitions complement the existing security segment product offerings increase its scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to customers as industry dynamics favor multisolution providers that offer ‘‘onestop shopping’’ the company continues to focus on integrating the acquired 

businesses as it expands the suite of its security product and service offerings various process improvement initiatives were initiated including integration of overlapping field service organizations and implementation of certain common back office systems these integration efforts will continue in 2008 particularly the reverse integration of the legacy electronic security business into hsm 

drive further profitable growth in branded tools and storage 

while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion into security is important management also recognizes that the branded construction  doityourself products and industrial businesses are the foundations on which the company was established and provide strong growth and cash flow generation prospects management is committed to growing these strong and profitable businesses through innovative product development brand support and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness to foster vitality over the long term acquisitionrelated growth will also be pursued where appropriate the following matters affected the branded tool and storage businesses 

    17

continue to invest in the stanley brand 

the stanley ® brand is recognized as one of the world’s great brands and is one of the company’s most valuable assets brand support was increased over the past several years including television advertising campaigns associated with new product rollouts continued nascar racing sponsorships as well as more print and webbased advertising that generated approximately one billion brand impressions annually these advertising and marketing campaigns yielded strong results as evidenced by various hand tools metrics during 2007 web traffic increase of 20 sales lead increase of 30 and brand awareness increase of 34 versus 2006 

institutionalize the stanley fulfillment system 

the company continued to practice the operating disciplines encompassed by the stanley fulfillment system ‘‘sfs’’ which is a continuous operational improvement process committed to increasing customer and shareowner value the sfs core disciplines consist of striving for perfect quality service excellence optimal cost and environmental health  safety the company applies sfs to many aspects of its business including procurement maximizing customer fill rates and acquisition integration the sfs program helped to mitigate the impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years sfs was instrumental in the reduction of inventories during 2007 and the related improvement in working capital turnover in 2008 and beyond the company plans to further leverage sfs to achieve higher working capital turns decreased cycle times reduced complexity in operations and increased customer satisfaction 

 aside from the strategic commentary above four other matters having a significant impact on the company’s results were inflation currency exchange rate fluctuations share repurchases and stock option expensing 

the company has been negatively impacted by inflation primarily commodity and freight which has increased costs by an estimated 165 million over the past three years during this period approximately twothirds of the cost increase was recovered through pricing actions and the remainder was largely offset through various cost reduction initiatives the company expects the negative impact of inflation affecting production and distribution costs during 2008 will be in the range of 75 – 80 million inclusive of new tariffs on fasteners imported from asia management plans to recover the majority of this impact through customer pricing and offset the remainder through plant productivity actions 

in recent years the strengthening of foreign currencies had a favorable impact on the translation of foreign currencydenominated operating results into us dollars the favorable impact of foreign currency translation including acquired companies contributed an estimated 19 05 and 04 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact either positive or negative on future earnings 

during 2007 and 2006 the company executed share repurchases of 36 million and 40 million outstanding shares of its common stock respectively for 200 million in each year the stock repurchases were accretive to diluted earnings per share by 6 cents in 2007 and 13 cents in 2006 the 2007 stock buybacks occurred later in the year than the related 2006 activity accordingly the benefit of the 2007 repurchase activity will not be fully reflected in weighted average shares outstanding used to compute earnings per share until 2008 the share repurchase benefit was partially offset by the issuance of 44 million shares of common stock under various employee plans over the two year period and also by higher interest expense associated with shortterm borrowings made to finance the share repurchases in january 2008 the company repurchased an additional 22 million of shares 

in 2006 the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 123 revised 2004 ‘‘sharebased payment’’ ‘‘sfas 123r’’ which requires all sharebased payments including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values as they are earned by the employees under the vesting terms 

pursuant to the adoption of sfas 123r the company recognized 9 million of noncash pretax stock option compensation expense in both 2007 and 2006 which reduced diluted earnings per share by 7 cents in each year compared to 2005 refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of sfas 123r 

results of operations 

below is a summary of the company’s operating results at the consolidated level followed by an overview of business segment performance the terms ‘‘organic’’ and ‘‘core’’ are utilized to describe results aside from the impact of acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods 

net sales net sales from continuing operations were 4484 billion in 2007 as compared to 4019 billion in 2006 a 12 increase acquisitions principally hsm contributed 7 in higher sales organic volume and pricing both increased 1 while favorable foreign currency translation in all regions increased sales 3 versus the prior year strong performance in the industrial segment particularly by the hydraulic and mechanics tools businesses was supplemented by more modest gains in the cdiy and security segments cdiy achieved robust growth internationally that was partially offset by weakness in the us associated with housing market declines in the security segment solid gains by the automatic door and mechanical lock businesses as well as overall pricing actions more than compensated for lower sales in the legacy electronic security integration business as it shed unprofitable equipment installations 

net sales from continuing operations were 4019 billion in 2006 as compared to 3285 billion in 2005 a 22 increase acquisitions contributed 21 or 689 million of the sales increase organic sales increased 1 driven by a slight increase in volume and relatively consistent pricing levels and foreign currency impact compared to the prior year the organic increase was generated by share gains achieved in the consumer hand tools and automatic doors businesses offset by price and volume declines experienced in the fastening systems business favorable foreign currency translation in the americas and europe was partially offset by a negative impact from asia 

gross profit the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1692 billion or 38 of net sales in 2007 compared to 1459 billion or 36 of net sales in 2006 the acquired businesses increased gross profit by 136 million core gross profit for 2007 was 1557 billion or 37 of net sales up 98 million from the prior year the core gross margin rate expanded on strong performances from certain industrial segment businesses primarily facom and mechanics tools as well as the absence of 22 million of inventory stepup amortization from the initial turnover of acquired inventory in 2006 this was partially offset by a decline in the cdiy segment gross margin rate mainly from unrecovered cost inflation in addition the legacy security integration business had lower margins on certain equipment installations price and productivity actions in 2007 more than offset 67 million of material energy and wage cost inflation the company expects such inflation to increase 2008 costs by 75 – 80 million which management plans to mitigate through various customer pricing actions and continued cost reduction and productivity initiatives 

the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1459 billion in 2006 or 36 of net sales compared to 1181 billion or 36 of net sales in 2005 the acquired businesses increased gross profit by 265 million included in the 2006 gross profit is the unfavorable impact of 22 million in noncash inventory stepup charges related to the initial turnover of acquired inventory gross profit for 2006 was 37 of net sales excluding this nonrecurring item primarily due to the positive impact of the facom acquisition core gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36 in 2006 which was consistent with the prior year the benefits of prior cost reduction actions productivity improvements from the stanley fulfillment system and pricing actions offset continued margin pressure from commodity and other inflation which resulted in approximately 48 million of additional costs and a decline in fastening systems the fastening systems gross profit decline reflected lower sales volumes a result of weakening housing markets and price erosion as well as a commitment to shed unprofitable business gross profit in this business was further impacted by commodity cost inflation management launched an extensive cost reduction initiative in 2006 with the objective to return fastening systems to acceptable profitability levels 

sga expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 1058 million or 24 of net sales in 2007 consistent with the 24 of sales represented by 955 million of expense in 2006 acquired companies contributed 70 million of the increase and the remaining 33 million increase is largely attributable to foreign currency translation 

sga from continuing operations was 955 million or 24 of net sales in 2006 compared to 737 million or 22 of net sales in the prior year the increase of 218 million primarily relates to acquired businesses that increased costs by 192 million 11 million of increased noncash stock compensation expense associated with the adoption of stock option expensing during 2006 and 11 million of increased brand support excluding acquisitions sga as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 23 of net sales compared with 22 in 2005 due to the items described above partially offset by benefits received from prior restructuring actions 

interest and othernet net interest expense from continuing operations in 2007 was 80 million compared to 65 million in 2006 the higher interest expense stems from borrowings necessary to fund the january 2007 acquisition of hsm refer to the financial condition section for additional discussion of the hsm acquisition financing 

net interest expense from continuing operations in 2006 was 65 million compared to 34 million in 2005 the increase was mainly due to the november 2005 issuance of 450 million in junior subordinated debt securities to fund acquisitions and to a lesser extent increased commercial paper borrowings resulting primarily from the execution of the 200 million share repurchase program in the first half of 2006 along with higher applicable shortterm interest rates 

othernet from continuing operations totaled 90 million of expense in 2007 compared to 57 million of expense in 2006 the increase pertained primarily to higher intangible asset amortization expense due to recent acquisitions 

othernet from continuing operations represented 57 million of expense in 2006 compared to 48 million of expense in 2005 the increase was primarily driven by 9 million of higher intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisition activity a 4 million pension plan curtailment charge in the uk and a 5 million increase in foreign currency losses partially offset by lower environmental expense and decreased losses on the sale of fixed assets 

income taxes the company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2007 was 25 as compared to 21 for 2006 and 24 for 2005 

the higher effective tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 mainly relates to benefits realized upon resolution of tax audits in 2006 that did not reoccur the lower effective tax rate in 2006 compared to 2005 was driven by the realization of credits against us taxes and the inclusion of the europeanbased facom acquisition additionally substantial costs were incurred in 2005 for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act and such costs were not incurred in 2006 

business segment results 

the company’s reportable segments are an aggregation of businesses that have similar products and services among other factors the company utilizes segment profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and sga aside from corporate overhead expense and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of sga interest income interest expense othernet inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense restructuring and asset impairments and income tax expense corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense cost for the executive management team and cost for certain centralized functions that benefit the entire company but are not directly attributable to the businesses such as legal and corporate finance functions refer to note o restructuring and asset impairments and note g goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments and intangibles amortization expense respectively attributable to each segment as discussed previously the company’s operations are classified into three business segments construction and doityourself ‘‘cdiy’’ industrial and security 

cdiy  

 

cdiy net sales from continuing operations increased 4 in 2007 from 2006 foreign currency translation contributed 3 to the higher sales pricing 1 and organic volume remained flat the us was adversely impacted by the housing market contraction as repair and remodel activity declined along with new construction sales were very strong in canada europe australia and asia in particular for the consumer tools and storage business this positive international performance was bolstered by new product introductions including the fatmax xl line as well as favorable economic conditions outside the us fastening systems also experienced an overall decline in sales due to the us housing downturn although its industrial channel and office product sales remained stable during 2007 the company took actions to improve the fastening systems cost structure including a mexican plant closure and the first wave of a pneumatic tool production shift to asia enabled by the 2006 besco acquisition as a result fastening systems improved its margin rate slightly despite the lower sales volume the company is on track to complete the migration of a second wave of fastening systems tool production to asia during 2008 which should further help return this business to acceptable long term profitability the segment profit rate decline of 70 basis points was mainly attributable to unrecovered cost inflation a product mix shift to lower margin tools along with a channel mix shift in the us and unfavorable absorption on inventory reductions these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation and the previously mentioned improvement in the fastening systems business 

net sales from continuing operations increased 3 in 2006 compared to 2005 of this increase acquisitions accounted for 3 while organic volume decreased by 1 and price remained flat foreign currency increased sales by 1 the consumer hand tool business continued to achieve share gains from the strong performance of the new fatmax ® xtreme ™ and fatmax ® xl ™ product lines which launched in the us and european markets representing the largest new hand tools product introduction in the company’s history at the same time the fatmax ® range of product offerings delivered growth though continued premium innovation distribution point expansion and related brand support this strong favorable performance was more than offset by lower volumes in the fastening consumer storage and mechanics tools businesses fastening systems organic sales declined 7 compared to the prior year stemming from weakness in the us construction market and management’s commitment to turn down unprofitable business sales in the consumer storage business in 2005 reflected higher volume from the initial launch of garage storage products the 30 basis point decrease in segment profit in 2006 versus 2005 is primarily due to the sales volume decline and cost inefficiencies experienced by the us fastening systems business increased brand support and commodity cost inflation partially offset by savings derived from prior cost reduction actions and favorable mix in the consumer hand tools business during 2007 progress was made on the twoyear plan to restore the fastening systems profits to acceptable levels by continuing the migration of production to asia reducing overall sga and the manufacturing footprint as well as sku rationalization in this regard the acquisition of asianbased besco and the opening of a new manufacturing facility in china during 2006 strategically aided the long term vitality of fastening systems 

industrial 

 

industrial segment net sales increased 10 in 2007 from 2006 comprised of a 4 volume increase a 4 favorable foreign currency impact 1 favorable pricing and 1 from the innerspace acquisition 

hydraulic tools and mechanics tools achieved robust sales increases along with strong performance from the facom and storage businesses the hydraulic tools sales increase is attributable to sustained high demand for recent shear product offerings strong international sales and favorable steel scrap markets industrial mechanics tools benefited from strong demand in the us oil and gas industry the higher facom sales pertain to new product introductions and improved european economic conditions intensified marketing efforts including an expanded sales force contributed to the vidmar storage growth segment profit as a percentage of net sales improved 380 basis points excluding the effect of the onetime inventory stepup charge from the initial turn of facom acquired inventory in 2006 segment profit increased 270 basis points customer price increases effectively offset the impact of cost inflation while productivity initiatives further contributed to the segment profit rate expansion additionally facom’s contribution to the higher segment profit rate reflects favorable currency translation and the benefits of acquisition integration actions 

industrial’s net sales increased 67 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the facom acquisition which increased sales by 436 million or 64 favorable pricing actions contributed 2 while volume increased sales 1 with foreign currency remaining flat compared to the prior year sales growth was delivered by the mac tools facom hydraulic tools industrial tools and storage businesses mac tools benefited in 2006 from improved retention of its distributors based on management actions initiated early in the year industrial tools and storage and the hydraulic tools businesses obtained share gains from the success of new product introductions in the oil and mining industries as demand for such commodities remained strong during 2006 segment profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 90 basis points due to 13 million of noncash inventory stepup amortization associated with the facom acquisition and supply chain inefficiencies in certain businesses pertaining to increased backlog partially offset by the accretive impact of facom 

security 

 

security segment sales increased 24 in 2007 hsm and other acquisitions contributed 21 while price and organic volume grew a combined 2 and currency 1 organic sales gains in automatic doors and mechanical locks were achieved on the strength of national and strategic account growth while the hardware business demonstrated resilience in recovering from the loss of a key customer effective pricing actions to recover inflation in raw material costs also contributed to sales growth in the segment shrinkage in the legacy us security integration ‘‘ussi’’ business’ sales and segment profit was a necessary byproduct of a business model change entailing a shift away from low profitability equipment installation to an emphasis on higher margin recurring service revenues the reverse integration of ussi into hsm with its superior bidding and project management disciplines is progressing well and management believes it will rebound in later 2008 the broader security segment product line is enabling the company to compete more effectively in the architectural bidding process to attain gains in commercial construction markets the 2007 segment profit rate showed a strong expansion of 210 basis points over 2006 this improvement is attributable to hsm the nonrecurring inventory stepup amortization for the national hardware acquisition recorded in 2006 the benefits of a partial shift in hardware production to asia and overall pricing and productivity in excess of inflation these positive factors were partially offset by the previously discussed decline in the legacy security integration businesses 

during 2006 security’s sales increased 25 acquisitions predominantly national contributed 21 organic sales volume 2 pricing 1 and currency 1 the automatic doors business grew its service revenue and achieved strong national account share gains driven by the favorable impact of new product introductions new store openings and increased modernization of preexisting stores the mechanical access businesses also benefited from new product introductions and an expanded ability to provide customers with virtually all of their varied mechanical product needs in addition the security segment as a whole benefited from the growth and continued integration of its national 

service footprint the 2006 segment profit as a percentage of net sales was 130 basis points lower than 2005 as the favorable impact from prior cost reduction and integration actions were negated by 8 million of noncash inventory stepup amortization from acquisitions and the dilutive impact of national hardware margins due to its legacy highcost manufacturing structure which the company continues to transition to low cost countries the segment operating profit rate was further affected by commodity cost inflation and the dilutive impact of other recently acquired companies until integration initiatives unfold 

restructuring activities 

at december 29 2007 the restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was 237 million which the company expects to largely utilize by the end of 2008 a summary of the restructuring reserve activity from december 30 2006 to december 29 2007 is as follows 

 

2007 actions during 2007 the company initiated cost reduction initiatives in order to maintain its cost competitiveness severance charges of 114 million have been recorded relating to the reduction of approximately 525 employees in addition to severance 02 million was recorded for the closure of a merged office facility and 02 million for asset impairments of these amounts 106 million has been utilized to date with 12 million of reserves remaining as of december 29 2007 

pre2007 actions during 2006 and 2005 the company initiated 183 million of cost reduction actions in various businesses of which 07 million was recorded during 2007 130 million was recorded in 2006 and 46 million was recorded in 2005 these actions were comprised of the severance of approximately 950 employees and the exit of a leased facility of this amount 182 million has been utilized to date offset slightly by a 02 million currency impact leaving 03 million of accrual remaining as of december 29 2007 in addition 08 million of reserves remain relating to pre2005 actions 

acquisition related during 2007 30 million of reserves were established for hsm in purchase accounting of this amount 11 million was for severance of approximately 55 employees and 19 million related to the closure of 13 branch facilities as of december 29 2007 08 million has been utilized leaving 22 million remaining the company also utilized 12 million of restructuring reserves during 2007 established for various minor prior year acquisitions as of december 29 2007 12 million in accruals for these small actions remains 

pursuant to the integration of the january 2006 facom acquisition and the related reorganization of facom and stanley hand tools activities in europe the company implemented restructuring initiatives these initiatives reduced the cost structure by rationalizing manufacturing logistics sales and support organizations this resulted in the severance of approximately 450 employees the closure of two legacy facom factories in france as well as four legacy facom distribution centers located in the united kingdom belgium germany and switzerland of the 604 million in total expenditures for these initiatives 594 million was recorded to the facom purchase price allocation and 10 million as a restructuring charge in 2006 as of december 29 2007 463 million has been utilized partially offset by a 39 million currency impact such that an 180 million accrual remains 

in connection with its acquisition of national in late 2005 the company recorded 80 million relating to severance costs for approximately 250 employees and 03 million facility closure costs to the 

purchase price allocation in addition 02 million of facility closure costs were recorded as restructuring charges in 2006 as of december 29 2007 most of this accrual has been utilized with the remaining 14 million excess reversed as a reduction of goodwill such that no accrual remains 

financial condition 

liquidity sources and uses of capital the company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under various credit facilities 

operating and investing activities the company has consistently generated strong operating cash flows over many years in 2007 cash flow from operations totaled 544 million up 105 million compared to 2006 the favorable increase principally stems from an expansion of cash earnings and improved working capital performance in this regard the higher noncash intangibles amortization expense from acquisitions reduced earnings but not cash flows working capital receivables inventories and accounts payable generated 23 million of higher cash inflows in 2007 compared with 2006 this working capital improvement reflects leaner inventory positions achieved through process improvement efforts while maintaining customer service levels and was accomplished despite lower receivable sale proceeds in 2007 versus 2006 these favorable impacts were partially offset by cash outflows for restructuring activities which amounted to 58 million in 2007 an increase of 29 million over 2006 primarily pertaining to payments for the facom europe initiatives 

in 2006 cash flow from operations was 439 million compared to 362 million in 2005 the 77 million improvement in 2006 versus 2005 is mainly attributable to higher cash earnings on the strength of acquisitions reflecting the removal of increased noncash expenses in 2006 particularly inventory stepup amortization associated with acquisitions intangible asset amortization expense and stockbased compensation expense receivables inventories and accounts payables generated 11 million of higher cash inflows in 2006 compared with 2005 due to increased receivable sales these favorable impacts were partially offset by cash outflows for restructuring activities which amounted to 29 million in 2006 an increase of 20 million over 2005 

capital expenditures were 87 million in 2007 80 million in 2006 and 68 million in 2005 the higher capital expenditures in 2007 pertained to investments for plant productivity improvements as well as ongoing information system spending for a major sap implementation underway in the americas the increase in 2006 capital expenditures versus 2005 was due to upgrades of information systems the incremental impact of normal capital spending incurred by recent acquisitions and equipment purchases related to new product introductions the company expects future capital expenditures to increase approximately in proportion to its sales growth 

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 457 million in 2007 representing a 29 increase over 2006 which in turn was up 23 versus 2005 management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the company’s common stock and business acquisitions among other items 

 

based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at december 29 2007 the company believes it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to the advantage of its shareholders’ advantage through a combination of acquisitions dividends debt repayment and potential future share repurchases 

in 2007 acquisition spending totaled 643 million mainly for the hsm bedcheck and innerspace businesses 2006 acquisition spending amounted to 572 million primarily pertaining to facom and 

besco and 20 million of debt repayments associated with the 2004 acquisition of blick pursuant to its profitable growth strategy the company will continue to assess its current business portfolio for disposition opportunities and make acquisitions in favored markets while minimizing the risk associated with large customer concentrations 

during 2006 the company entered into a saleleaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building under the terms of the transaction the company received 23 million in cash proceeds reported in investing cash flows and recorded a deferred gain of 11 million which will be amortized over the 15 year operating lease term the cash proceeds were utilized to pay down shortterm borrowings 

financing activities payments on longterm debt amounted to 228 million in 2007 4 million in 2006 and 72 million in 2005 net proceeds from shortterm borrowings totaled 192 million in 2007 and the cash inflows were used to fund acquisitions and repurchases of common stock repayments of shortterm borrowings amounted to a cash outflow of 66 million in 2006 as commercial paper was paid down utilizing a portion of the strong operating cash flows net proceeds from short term borrowings of 103 million in 2005 primarily arose from commercial paper issued to fund the 2005 acquisitions aside from national 

there is a 550 million committed longterm credit facility that matures in october 2009 which is designated as a liquidity backstop for the commercial paper program as of december 29 2007 there were no outstanding loans under this facility and the company had 279 million of commercial paper outstanding the company is in negotiations with its credit banks to increase this line to 800 million and extend the maturity to february 2013 and does not anticipate anything that would inhibit the successful conclusion of that increase and extension in addition the company has uncommitted shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 340 million of which 322 million was available at december 29 2007 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal aggregate credit lines amounted to 890 million in addition to these lines of credit the company maintains a committed facility designed for the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity as of december 29 2007 the company’s maximum available funds under this arrangement were 66 million of which 42 million was utilized 

the company increased its cash dividend per common share to 122 in 2007 dividends per common share increased 34 in 2007 35 in 2006 and 55 in 2005 

in 2007 the company repurchased 38 million shares of its common stock for 207 million an average of 5464 per share and in 2006 it repurchased 40 million shares for 202 million an average of 5007 per share the company may decide to repurchase more of its outstanding common stock based on various factors including the level of acquisition activity the market price of the common stock and its current financial condition 

the company initially funded the 546 million hsm acquisition with a combination of shortterm borrowings and cash a 500 million 364day revolving credit bridge facility was entered into on january 8 2007 of which 1300 million was utilized to acquire hsm the remainder of the hsm purchase price was funded through commercial paper borrowings and cash 

on march 20 2007 the company completed two security offerings ‘‘equity units’’ which consisted of 330 million of fiveyear convertible notes and 330 million of threeyear forward stock purchase contracts and 200 million of unsecured threeyear fixedrate term notes with respect to the 860 million in offerings the company will not receive the 330 million of cash pertaining to the forward stock purchase contracts until may 2010 the 488 million net cash proceeds of these offerings and the related equity instruments described below were used to pay down the shortterm bridge facility and commercial paper borrowings 

the convertible notes are pledged and held as collateral to guarantee the equity unit investors’ obligation to purchase shares in may 2010 under the stock purchase contract the convertible notes reflect a conversion price of approximately 6480 or a 19 premium as of the date of issuance at maturity the company must repay the convertible note principal in cash additionally to the extent that the conversion option is ‘‘in the money’’ the company at its election will deliver either cash or 

shares of common stock based on a conversion rate and the applicable market value of the company’s common stock at that time a maximum of approximately 61 million shares may be issued in may 2010 under the stock purchase contracts essentially at the higher of approximately 5445 or market value at that time 

the company simultaneously entered into related convertible note hedge and stock warrant transactions with financial institutions share dilution pertaining to the conversion option of the convertible notes will occur in interim periods if the share price exceeds approximately 6480 at maturity in 2012 the convertible note hedge will offset the potentially dilutive impact of the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes because the convertible note hedge is antidilutive it will not be included in any diluted shares outstanding computation prior to its maturity however at maturity the aggregate effect of the convertible notes and the convertible note hedge is that there will be no net increase in the company’s common shares the company also issued 51 million of unregistered stock warrants that are exercisable during the period august 17 2012 through september 28 2012 with a strike price of 8712 subject to standard antidilution protection for increases in the dividend rate stock splits etc in the event the stock warrants become ‘‘in the money’’ during their 5 year term due to the market value of the company’s common stock exceeding the strike price there will be a related increase in diluted shares outstanding utilized in the determination of diluted earnings per share 

the combined terms of the convertible note hedge stock warrants and convertible notes in substance reestablish the conversion option aspect of the convertible notes at 60 above the 5445 market value of the company’s common stock at inception such that in effect the company will retain the benefits of share price appreciation if any up to a market value equal to the stock warrant strike price additionally the company will retain benefits of share price appreciation through the maturity of the stock purchase contract element of the equity units that will entail issuance of 330 million of common shares at the higher of approximately 5445 or market price in may 2010 refer to note i longterm debt and financing arrangements for further detail 

under present accounting rules the entire 330 million convertible note obligation is reflected in longterm debt on the company’s balance sheet and the interest expense is being recognized thereon at a variable rate of 3month libor minus 35 currently 12 for the first three years with the interest rate to be reset upon remarketing of the notes for the final two years they are outstanding such interest expense recognizable under current accounting rules will equal the cash interest payments to be made an exposure draft issued by the fasb in august 2007 fsp apb 14a ‘‘ accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement ’’ if issued in its current form would require a portion approximately 60 million of the convertible notes to be reclassified to equity and accreted to interest expense over the five year term of the convertible notes accordingly interest expense would be reported at the company’s nonconvertible borrowing rate at the time of issuance an annual rate of approximately 3month libor plus 02 currently 49 which would result in the recognition of 12 – 13 million of additional annual noncash interest expense an impact of approximately 10 cents per diluted share per year fasb is redeliberating the exposure draft proposing this change to report noncash interest expense and it is expected that any such change to the accounting for the convertible notes would not occur until at least fiscal 2009 

in november 2005 the company consummated a section 144a offering with registration rights of 450 million of enhanced trust preferred securities ‘‘etps’’ through its unconsolidated trust subsidiary the stanley works capital trust i ‘‘the trust’’ contemporaneously the company borrowed the proceeds of the etps offering from the trust by issuing 450 million of junior subordinated debt securities payable to the trust the net proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisitions of national and facom which closed on november 30 2005 and january 1 2006 respectively these securities and underlying junior subordinated debt securities collectively the ‘‘securities’’ feature a 5 year fixed rate period ending december 1 2010 and a floating rate period ending december 1 2045 the fixed coupon was set at 5902 the obligations tenor and terms of the etps mirror those of the junior subordinated debt securities the securities can be redeemed by the company on or after december 1 2010 without penalty for early payment 

debt to capital ratio the company’s debt to capital ratio was 47 at the end of 2007 39 at the end of 2006 and 42 at the end of 2005 reflecting the credit protection measures that are incorporated into the terms of the 450 million etps issued in late 2005 and the equity characteristics of the 2007 issuance of 330 million equity units the debt to capital ratio of the company is more fairly represented by apportioning equity credit to the etps and equity units issuances when making the calculation the resulting debt to capital ratio from this apportionment is 32 – 35 as of december 29 2007 this adjustment is consistent with the treatment accorded these securities by the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations that rate the company’s debt securities and accordingly the equitycontentadjusted debt to capital ratio is considered a relevant measure of its financial condition 

the following table reconciles the december 2007 debt to capital ratio computed with reported debt and equity to the same measure after the equity content adjustments attributed to the etps and equity unit securities

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its 

global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi ‘‘rmb’’ and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection primarily purchased basket options the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into several crosscurrency interest rate swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2007 would have been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all currencies the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes 

the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the usd the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the 7 appreciation of the rmb during 2007 has not as yet generated material cost increases for products sourced from china further significant appreciation of the rmb or other currencies in countries where the company sources product could adversely impact profitability in the event significant rmb or other currency appreciation occurs the company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact 

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor and euribor rates at december 29 2007 the result of a hypothetical two percentage point increase in shortterm libor and euribor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the pretax profit of the company 

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects in 2007 the company experienced approximately 67 million of commodity energy and wage inflation most of which was recovered through favorable pricing actions such inflation increased costs by approximately 45 million in 2006 and 49 million in 2005 which management mitigated through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives if commodity prices fluctuated to reach new historical high levels the company’s exposure could increase from the expected levels for 2008 as previously discussed 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of management’s discussion and analysis 

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values the company 

employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 

the company has significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are none that exceed 10 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business 

approximately 24 of 2007 sales were in the americas region of the construction and doityourself segment this portion of the company has been adversely affected by the decline in us housing and general construction markets in the event these domestic housing and construction markets deteriorate further or the downturn spreads to european or asian markets this could have an unfavorable impact on future results the 2007 european and asian sales were robust in the cdiy segment management believes geographic as well as industrial diversification helps mitigate the risk of variability in future results from issues that may arise from time to time in certain markets the company serves 

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no material instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating the company has the flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its etps obligation for up to 5 years while there can be no guarantee of the future the company has an investmentgrade credit rating and has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the commercial paper and bank markets throughout the credit crunch that has recently arisen further the company has not encountered liquidity difficulties historically when similar credit tightening has occurred due to macroeconomic issues moreover the company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity including operating cash flows are considered adequate to conduct business as normal accordingly based on present conditions and past history management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy 

other matters 

employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an employee stock ownership plan ‘‘esop’’ under which the ongoing us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop expense amounted to 2 million in each of the years 2007 2006 and 2005 while the average market value of shares released increased from 4641 in 2005 to 5604 in 2007 other elements of esop expense including a gradual reduction in the number of shares released annually from the trust offset the favorable impact of the higher share price esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines 

new accounting standards refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position 

critical accounting estimates preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates 

allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations in these cases management uses its judgment based on the surrounding facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience 

if circumstances change for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market while nonus inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits ‘‘skus’’ to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly 

property plant and equipment the company generally values property plant and equipment ‘‘ppe’’ at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company has previously recorded impairment losses related to unused and underutilized assets and such losses may occur in the future 

goodwill and intangible assets the company completed acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 valued at 647 million and 550 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 15 billion of goodwill and 322 million of indefinitelived trade names at december 29 2007 

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangible asset impairment involves the estimation of fair value impairment testing of goodwill also requires the identification and valuation of reporting units the estimates of fair value of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and related reporting units are based on the information available at the date of assessment including management assumptions about future cash flows discount rates and royalty rates which are utilized to estimate the present value of future cash flows to be generated by the indefinitelived assets future cash flows can be 

affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with acquired entities while the company has not recorded goodwill or other intangible asset impairment losses in many years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event expected profitability cash flows or trade name usage change significantly from current estimates 

environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of december 29 2007 the company had reserves of 30 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is 23 million to 56 million which is subject to change in the near term the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy while the company believes the 30 million liability recorded for environmental matters is adequate it is possible that future developments may require charges for environmental exposures in excess of this reserve 

income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards is 146 million at december 29 2007 and 126 million at december 30 2006 the company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of december 29 2007 amounted to 27 million 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information when it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be asserted the company accrues its best estimate of the tax liability inclusive of related interest charges see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

risk insurance to some extent the company self insures for various business exposures for domestic workers’ compensation automobile and product liability the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses ‘‘stop loss’’ insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers’ compensation and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form the basis for workers’ compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary contemplates the company’s specific loss history actual claims 

reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists insurance companies for workers’ compensation and by inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for automobile and product liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected future claim payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 29 2007 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 

warranty the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the 64 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december 29 2007 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain items submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability 

offbalance sheet arrangements offbalance sheet arrangements include the following 

receivable securitizations the company has agreements to sell on a revolving basis pools of accounts and notes receivables to a qualified special purpose entity ‘‘qspe’’ which qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary the entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable assets and related debt offbalance sheet were both 42 million at december 29 2007 compared to 60 million as of december 30 2006 the company is responsible for servicing these accounts while the qspe bears the risk of noncollection the net cash flows from sales of eligible receivables to the qspe in revolvingperiod securitizations amounted to a cash outflow of 18 million in 2007 and a cash inflow of 44 million in 2006 there were no gains or losses on these cash flows 

synthetic leases the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers and certain personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility as of december 29 2007 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 105 million and 83 million respectively 

trust the company owns 100 of the common stock 01 million of the stanley works capital trust i ‘‘the trust’’ which was formed in 2005 to initiate the offering of the 450 million enhanced trust preferred securities ‘‘etps’’ however in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r ‘‘consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51’’ ‘‘fin 46r’’ the trust is not consolidated since the 450 million of junior subordinated debt issued by the company to the trust is reflected on the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2007 consolidation of the trust would have virtually no impact to the company’s results of operations or financial position

competition 

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands its commitment to customer service strong customer relationships the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product innovation

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware businesses who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the company’s the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines within a particular segment certain large customers offer private label brands ‘‘house brands’’ that compete across a wider spectrum of the company’s product offerings the company is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line of products than any other toolmaker the company is a significant manufacturer of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners to the construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of handheld hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroad utilities and public works the company also believes that it is among the largest direct providers of access security integration services in north america

several of the company’s largest retail customers have elected to compete with the company by developing house brands and sourcing products generally from low cost countries

customers 

a substantial portion of the company’s products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the us and europe in 2006 net sales to the home depot were 10 of the company’s consolidated sales from continuing operations a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of the customer referred to above or the loss of certain of the other larger home centers or mass merchants as customers could have a material adverse effect on the company until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has been able to maintain a diversified customer base and has decreased the potential customer concentration risk over the past years as sales from continuing operations in markets outside of the home center and mass merchant distribution channels have grown at a greater rate through a combination of efforts to broaden the customer base primarily in the security solutions and industrial tools segments in this regard sales to the company’s largest customer as a percentage of the total company’s sales have decreased from 22 to 10 since 2002

raw materials 

the company’s products are manufactured of both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel aluminum zinc brass copper and nickel as well as resin additionally the company uses other commodity based materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products the raw materials required are available from a number of sources at competitive prices and the company has annual or quarterly spot contracts with many of its key suppliers certain commodity prices particularly energy related and nonferrous metals are expected to remain volatile in 2007 but the company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials used in its production processes

backlog 

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in most of the company’s consumer products and industrial tools businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 3 2007 the company had approximately 347 million in unfilled orders compared with 274 million in unfilled orders at february 5 2006 all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result the company produces primarily for inventory rather than to fill specific orders

patents and trademarks 

no business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments the company owns numerous patents none of which individually are material to the company’s operations as a whole these patents expire at various times over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the company’s operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in duration but generally run from one to 20 years

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide the stanley ® and stanley in a notched rectangle design trademarks are material to all three business segments these wellknown trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are among the world’s most trusted brand names the company’s tagline ‘‘make something great ™ ’’ is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments the bostitch ®  besco powerlock ®  tape rule case design powerlock fatmax ®  fatmax ® xtreme ™  fatmax ® xl ™  labounty ®  mac ®  proto ®  jensen ®  

vidmar ®  cst ®  zag ®  rolatape ®  blackhawk ™ by proto ®  atro ®  national ®  facom ®  virax ® and usag ® trademarks are also material to the consumer products and industrial tools segments in the security solutions segment the best ®  blick ®  frisco bay ®  pac ®  wanderguard ®  stanvision ™  safemasters ®  sargent and greenleaf ® and isr ™ trademarks are also material to this segment the terms of these trademarks vary typically from 10 to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms

environmental regulations 

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to environmental matters

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially responsible party ‘‘prp’’ in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including fifteen active superfund sites

current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the company’s volumetric contribution at these sites

the company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of december 30 2006 the company had reserves of approximately 31 million for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

employees 

at december 30 2006 the company had approximately 17600 employees nearly 8200 of whom were employed in the us approximately 765 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 13 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the company’s hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the company’s labor agreements in the us expire in 2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the company’s operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors

the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k including those risks set forth under the heading entitled ‘‘cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995’’ and in other documents that the company files with the us securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to its securities if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop the company’s business financial condition results of operations and future growth prospects could change under these circumstances the trading prices of the company’s securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company’s securities 

large customer concentration and related customer inventory adjustments may negatively impact sales results of operations and cash flows 

the company has certain significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers such as the home depot lowe’s and walmart the home depot individually accounted for 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales from continuing operations for the year ended december 30 2006 the loss or material reduction of business from or the lack of success of sales initiatives for the company’s products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows

in addition unanticipated inventory adjustments by such customers can have a negative impact on sales for example severe inventory adjustments taken by certain large north american home center customers in december 2005 negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 million versus normal levels while the company did not experience a significant impact from such customer inventory adjustments in late 2006 they may reoccur in the future

customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

a substantial portion of the company’s products in the consumer products and industrial tools segments are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

the company’s growth and repositioning strategies include acquisitions the company’s recent acquisitions may not further its strategies and the company may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates 

in 2002 the company embarked on a growth strategy to shift its business portfolio toward favored growth markets through acquisitions and divestitures and thereby to reduce the risk associated with large customer concentrations the strategy has been advanced over the last five years with the sales of the company’s residential entry door and home décor businesses and the acquisition of a number of companies including hsm electronic protection services inc ‘‘hsm’’ facom sa ‘‘facom’’ national manufacturing co ‘‘national’’ besco pneumatic corporation ‘‘besco’’ best lock corporation and its affiliates ‘‘best access’’ chicago steel tape co and affiliates ‘‘cstberger’’ blick plc ‘‘blick’’ frisco bay industries ltd ‘‘frisco bay’’ isr solutions inc ‘‘isr’’ security group inc ‘‘security group’’ and precision hardware inc ‘‘precision’’

although the company has extensive experience with acquisitions there can be no assurance that recently acquired companies will be successfully integrated and effectively implement the company’s growth and repositioning strategy if the company successfully integrates the acquired companies and effectively implements its repositioning strategy there can be no assurance that its resulting business segments will enjoy continued market acceptance or profitability

in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully identify suitable future acquisition candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain the necessary financing complete the transactions or successfully integrate the new company as necessary to continue its growth and repositioning strategies

the company’s acquisitions may result in certain risks for its business and operations 

the company has made a number of acquisitions in the past three years including but not limited to hsm in january 2007 besco in july 2006 facom in january 2006 national in november 2005 precision in may 2005 security group in january 2005 isr in december 2004 frisco bay in march 2004 as well as cstberger and blick in january 2004 the company may make additional acquisitions in the future acquisitions involve a number of risks including

   any intangible assets that the company acquires may have a negative effect on its earnings and return on capital employed in addition the success of the company’s future acquisitions will depend in part on its ability to

   failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions may adversely affect the company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results the company is still in the process of integrating the businesses and operations of facom national besco hsm and other acquisitions with its existing businesses and operations the company cannot ensure that such integrations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies will be realized

the company may incur significant additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities in connection with future acquisitions which may restrict the manner in which it conducts business the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings 

as more fully described in item 7 and note i longterm debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company issued 450 million of enhanced trust preferred securities through its trust subsidiary in 2005 the net proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the acquisitions of facom and national in addition the company has a five year revolving credit agreement enabling borrowings up to 550 million this agreement includes provisions that allow designated subsidiaries to borrow up to 250 million in euros and pound sterling which may be available to among other things fund acquisitions

on january 8 2007 the company entered into a new 500 million 364day bridge facility which was utilized to partially finance the 545 million hsm acquisition on january 16 2007 the company intends to permanently refinance this bridge facility in 2007 with a combination of available cash and the issuance of longterm debt and equitylinked securities

the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company’s current indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that include among other things

    future new instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive covenants such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies

the company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact sales and brand reputation 

the company’s trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position unauthorized imitation of its products or unauthorized use of its trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company’s products but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers contractors suppliers andor licensees as well as divert management time and attention there can be no assurance that the company’s ongoing effort to protect its brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations in addition the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow the company to protect its proprietary rights to the same extent as it is able to in the united states

the company has trademark licensing programs and licensees may not comply with product quality manufacturing standards marketing and other requirements 

the company licenses certain of its trademarks to third parties for manufacturing marketing distribution and sale of various products while it enters into comprehensive licensing agreements with its licensees covering product design product quality sourcing manufacturing marketing and other requirements such licensees may not comply fully with those agreements noncompliance could include marketing products under the company’s brand names that do not meet its quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet the company’s supplier code of conduct these activities could harm brand equity reputation and business

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company’s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

the success of the company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives its sales force and other personnel including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage the company must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support its projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its growth strategy

the company faces active competition and if it does not compete effectively its business may suffer 

the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures the company’s products compete on the basis of among other things its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands price innovation and customer service capabilities the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses these companies are often located in countries such as china 

taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the united states canada and western europe also certain large customers offer private label brands that compete with some of the company’s product offerings as a lowercost alternative to remain profitable and defend market share the company must maintain a competitive cost structure develop new products and services respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins

the stanley fulfillment system ‘‘sfs’’ is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company’s business such as procurement quality in manufacturing maximizing customer fill rates integrating acquisitions and other key businesses processes in the event the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected

in addition the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services or make other concessions to stay competitive and retain market share the company engages in restructuring actions sometimes entailing shifts of production to low cost countries as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure if the company does not execute restructuring actions well its ability to meet customer demand may decline or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits

the company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflation in the cost of raw materials freight and energy 

the company’s products are manufactured of both ferrous and nonferrous metals including but not limited to steel aluminum zinc brass nickel and copper as well as resin additionally the company uses other commodity based materials for components and packaging including but not limited to plastics wood and other corrugated products as described in more detail in item 7 hereto the company has been negatively impacted by commodity and freight inflation in recent years and it expects energy and certain commodity prices particularly nonferrous metals to increase if the company is unable to mitigate these inflation increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives its profitability may be adversely affected

ultimate income tax payments may differ from amounts currently recorded by the company future tax law changes may materially increase the company’s prospective income tax expense 

the company is subject to income taxation in the united states as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions judgment is required in determining the company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate outcome from any audit or related litigation could be materially different from amounts reflected in the company’s income tax provisions and accruals future settlements of income tax audits may have a material effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in the financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement additionally it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company’s worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes effective

the company’s failure to continue to successfully manage defend litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows 

as described in further detail in items 1 and 3 and note s contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business including from time to time litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions product liability workers compensation the company’s distributors intellectual property claims regulatory actions and environmental matters there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully manage and 

defend such matters in addition given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation which could negatively impact profitability 

exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global operations enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi ‘‘rmb’’ in preparing its financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates with respect to the effects on translated earnings if the us dollar strengthens relative to local currencies the company’s earnings could be negatively impacted although the company utilizes risk management tools including hedging as it deems appropriate to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated the company does not make a practice of hedging its non us dollar earnings

in addition on july 21 2005 china announced it will let the rmb fluctuate within a very tight band − 3 around weighted average prior day close thereby effectively adopting a managed float and ending its decadeold valuation de facto peg to the us dollar the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the us dollar the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the present 3 appreciation of the rmb should not generate material cost increases for rmb denominated purchases further appreciation of this or other currencies utilized for procurement could adversely affect profitability the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases

the company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas 

the company imports large quantities of finished goods components and raw materials substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions in addition the countries in which the company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from may from time to time impose additional quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions on its imports or adversely modify existing restrictions imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company’s cost of goods sold adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or the company’s suppliers’ failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws could harm the company’s business

the company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties andor quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company’s business such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets such as the us or the european union

the company’s ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as port and shipping capacity labor disputes severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on the company’s business and financial condition

if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived tradenames or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

as a result of acquisitions the company has 11 billion of goodwill 298 million of indefinitelived tradenames and 223 million of definitelived intangible assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at december 30 2006 the company is required to periodically at least annually determine if its goodwill or indefinitelived tradenames have become impaired in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset the definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside the company’s control such as technological change intensified competition or other matters causing a decline in expected future cash flows if the company were required to write down all or part of its goodwill indefinitelived tradenames or other definitelived intangible assets its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected

if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating and other expenses certain us employee benefit plan expense is affected by the market value of the company’s common stock 

as described in further detail in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company sponsors pension and other post retirement defined benefit plans as well as an employee stock ownership plan ‘‘esop’’ under which the primary us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded the company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities bonds and other fixed income securities and money market instruments the company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require among other things that the company make cash contributions to under funded pension plans the company expects to contribute approximately 13 million to its pension and other post retirement defined benefit plans in 2007

there can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient in the future it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make significant additional cash contributions to the plans which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes or that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company

overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop expense amounted to 2 million in each of the years 2006 2005 and 2004 while the average market value of shares released increased from 4320 in 2004 to 4928 in 2006 other elements of esop expense including a gradual reduction in the number of shares released annually from the trust offset the favorable impact of the higher share price esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines

the company provides a 5 guaranteed rate of return on participant contributions made to the tax deferred 401k savings plan prior to july 1998 when all contributions were invested in stanley common stock the value of the shares purchased by participants prior to july 1998 along with the 5 cumulative guaranteed rate of return on stanley common stock is known as an investment protection account ‘‘ipa’’ beginning in july 1998 the investment options for plan participant contributions were enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in addition to the company’s common stock and there is no guaranteed rate of return to participants on any contributions made after that time the ipa guarantee is included in the actuarial valuation of the ongoing us pension plan payments related to the ipa guarantees if they have any value would be made to participants over a period of many years generally as they retire in the event the market value of stanley common stock declines below 4359 which is the stock price at which there was a settlement of this liability additional costs may be triggered by the ipa benefit guarantee

business overview

the company is a worldwide supplier of consumer products industrial tools and security solutions for professional commercial industrial and consumer use its operations are classified into three business segments consumer products industrial tools and security solutions the consumer products segment manufactures and markets hand tools consumer mechanics tools storage units and hardware these products are sold primarily to professional end users and distributed through retailers including home centers mass merchants hardware stores and retail lumber yards the industrial tools segment manufactures and markets professional mechanics and hand tools pneumatic tools and fasteners storage systems plumbing heating air conditioning and roofing tools hydraulic tools and accessories assembly tools and systems and electronic leveling and measuring tools these products are sold to customers and distributed primarily through third party distributors as well as through direct sales forces the security solutions segment is a provider of access and security solutions primarily for retailers educational financial and healthcare institutions as well as commercial governmental and industrial customers the company provides an extensive suite of mechanical and electronic security products and systems including automatic doors door closers access controls exit devices software and locking mechanisms as well as a variety of security services security integration related installation and maintenance services

for several years the company has focused on a profitable growth strategy and begun to transform itself from a mature 160 year old ‘‘american tool company’’ to an innovative multinational diversified industrial growth business this strategy has included approximately 2 billion of acquisitions since the beginning of 2002 several key divestitures the reduction of risk associated with certain large customer concentrations and increased brand investments additionally the strategy reflects management’s vision to build a growth platform in security while expanding the valuable branded tools and hardware platforms over the past several years the company has generated strong free cash flow and received substantial proceeds from divestitures that were utilized to invest in the transformation of the business portfolio

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 359 million in 2006 294 million in 2005 and 317 million in 2004 considerably exceeding net earnings from continuing operations the company believes free cash flow is an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners

 

the company strives to reinvest its free cash flow in high return businesses in order to generate strong return on assets and improve working capital efficiency significant areas of tactical emphasis related to execution of this strategy and its ability to generate free cash flow as well as events impacting the company’s financial performance in 2006 and 2005 are discussed below

continued growth of security solutions business 

the company further advanced its strategy of becoming a global market leader in the commercial security industry annual revenues of the security solutions segment have grown to 887 million or 22 of 2006 sales up from 105 million or 5 of 2001 sales key events pertaining to the growth of this segment in the past two years include the following

    16

the above acquisitions complement the existing security solutions’ product offering increase its scale and strengthen the value proposition offered to end user customers as industry dynamics favor multisolution providers that offer ‘‘onestop shopping’’ capabilities the company continues to focus on integrating the acquired businesses as it expands the suite of its security product and service offerings in 2006 and 2005 various process improvement initiatives were initiated including integration of overlapping field service organizations and implementation of certain common back office systems these integration efforts will continue for the next two years

drive further profitable growth in branded tools and hardware 

while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion into security solutions is important management also recognizes that the branded consumer products and industrial tools businesses are the foundations on which the company was established and provide strong growth and cash flow generation prospects while these businesses are strong and profitable today management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development brand support and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness in order to maintain vitality over the long term acquisitionrelated growth will also be pursued where appropriate the following matters affected these businesses

    17

  continue to invest in the stanley brand 

the stanley ® brand is recognized as one of the world’s great brands and is one of the company’s most valuable assets brand support was increased during 2006 2005 and 2004 including television advertising campaigns associated with new product rollouts continued nascar racing sponsorships as well as more print and webbased advertising that generated approximately one billion brand impressions annually these advertising and marketing campaigns yielded strong results as evidenced by various hand tools metrics during 2006 web traffic increase of 31 sales lead increase of 9 brand awareness increase of 30 and intent to buy increase of 30 versus 2005

institutionalize the stanley fulfillment system 

the company continued to practice the operating disciplines specified by the stanley fulfillment system ‘‘sfs’’ which is a continuous operational improvement process committed to increasing customer and shareowner value sfs’s core disciplines consist of striving to achieve perfect quality service excellence optimal cost and environmental health  safety the company applies sfs to many aspects of its business including procurement maximizing customer fill rates acquisition integration and other key business processes the sfs program helped to mitigate the impact of material price inflation that was experienced in recent years in 2007 the company plans to expand its efforts to leverage sfs across the enterprise with the intent of increasing working capital turns decreasing cycle times and increasing customer satisfaction

 aside from the strategic commentary above four other matters having a significant impact on the company’s results were inflation currency exchange rate fluctuations share repurchase and stock option expensing

the company has been negatively impacted by inflation primarily commodity and freight which has increased costs by approximately 85 million over the past two years during this period the company has recovered approximately 68 of the cost increase through pricing actions and largely offset the remainder through various cost reduction initiatives the company expects the negative impact of inflation during 2007 will be in the range of 60 — 65 million and plans to recover more than twothirds of this impact through pricing and offset the remainder through productivity actions

in recent years the strengthening of foreign currencies had a favorable impact on the translation of foreign currencydenominated operating results into us dollars it is estimated that the favorable impact of foreign currency translation including acquired companies contributed 004 and 012 of 

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2005 and 2004 and had no effect on 2006 earnings per share this impact was principally from the canadian dollar and asian currencies in 2005 and european currencies in 2004 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact on future earnings either positive or negative

during 2006 the company repurchased 4 million outstanding shares of its common stock for 200 million this stock repurchase program was accretive to diluted earnings per share by approximately 13 cents in 2006 this was partially offset by the issuance of 21 million shares of common stock under various employee plans

in 2006 the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 123 revised 2004 ‘‘sharebased payment’’ ‘‘sfas 123r’’ which requires all sharebased payments including grants of employee stock options to be recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values as they are earned by the employees under the vesting terms pursuant to the adoption of sfas 123r the company recognized 9 million of noncash pretax stock option compensation expense in 2006 which negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by 7 cents compared to the corresponding 2005 period refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of sfas 123r

results of operations

below is a summary of the company’s operating results at the consolidated level followed by an overview of business segment performance the terms ‘‘organic’’ and ‘‘core’’ are utilized to describe results aside from the significant impact of acquisitions and do not include their results of operations until they have reached their respective one year anniversary dates this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods

net sales net sales from continuing operations were 4019 billion in 2006 as compared to 3285 billion in 2005 a 22 increase acquisitions contributed 21 or 689 million of the sales increase organic sales increased 1 driven by relatively consistent volume pricing levels and foreign currency impact compared to the prior year the organic increase was generated by share gains achieved in the consumer hand tools and automatic doors businesses offset by price and volume declines experienced in the fastening systems business favorable foreign currency translation in the americas and europe was partially offset by a negative impact from asia

net sales from continuing operations were 3285 billion in 2005 as compared to 2997 billion in 2004 a 10 increase acquisitions contributed 6 or 167 million of the sales increase organic sales increased 4 driven by 2 volume growth 1 favorable foreign currency and a 1 positive pricing impact the organic volume growth was attributed to strong consumer products demand based on successful consumer hand tool and garage storage new product introductions as well as increases in several industrial tools businesses principally industrial mechanics tools hydraulic tools leveling  measuring tools and fastening systems favorable foreign currency translation in canada and asia increased net sales by 1

gross profit the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1459 billion or 36 of net sales in 2006 compared to 1181 billion or 36 of net sales in the prior year the acquired businesses increased gross profit by 265 million included in the 2006 gross profit is the unfavorable impact of 22 million in noncash inventory stepup charges related to the initial turnover of acquired inventory gross profit for 2006 was 37 of net sales excluding this nonrecurring item primarily due to the positive impact of the facom acquisition core gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36 in 2006 which was consistent with the prior year the benefits of prior cost reduction actions productivity improvements from the stanley fulfillment system and pricing actions offset continued margin pressure from commodity and other inflation which resulted in approximately 48 million of additional costs and a decline in fastening systems the company expects inflation to increase 2007 costs by approximately 60 – 65 million which management plans to mitigate through various customer pricing actions and continued cost reduction and productivity initiatives the fastening systems’ gross profit decline reflected lower sales volumes a result of weakening housing 

markets and price erosion as well as a commitment to shed unprofitable business gross profit in this business was further impacted by commodity cost inflation management launched an extensive cost reduction initiative with the objective to return fastening systems’ to acceptable profitability over a two year period

the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1181 billion or 36 of net sales in 2005 compared to 1104 billion or 37 of net sales in the prior year acquisitions increased gross profit by 52 million the remaining 25 million improvement was primarily attributed to the increase in organic sales volume and continued benefits of the stanley fulfillment system as a percentage of sales the year over year gross margin rate decline primarily stems from unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business and to a lesser extent the impact of recently acquired businesses which possess lower gross margin percentages until integration synergies are realized during 2005 there was carryover of commodity inflation from 2004 which resulted in approximately 40 million of additional costs that were mostly recovered through favorable pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives

sga expenses selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were 955 million or 24 of net sales in 2006 compared to 737 million or 22 of net sales in the prior year the increase of 218 million primarily relates to acquired businesses that increased costs by 192 million 11 million of increased noncash stock compensation expense principally associated with the adoption of stock option expensing during 2006 and 11 million of increased brand support excluding acquisitions sga as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 23 of net sales compared with 22 in 2005 due to the items described above partially offset by benefits received from prior restructuring actions

selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were 737 million or 22 of net sales in 2005 compared to 691 million or 23 of net sales in the prior year the increase of 46 million mainly pertains to acquired businesses that increased costs by 34 million and 14 million of increased brand support excluding acquisitions sga as a percentage of sales decreased 50 basis points compared with 2004 levels despite the higher brand support expense due to sales volume leverage lower sarbanesoxley compliance costs and effective cost controls

interest and othernet net interest expense from continuing operations in 2006 was 65 million compared to 34 million in 2005 the increase was mainly due to the november 2005 issuance of 450 million in junior subordinated debt securities to fund acquisitions and to a lesser extent increased commercial paper borrowings resulting primarily from the execution of the 200 million share repurchase program in the first half of 2006 along with higher applicable shortterm interest rates interest expense will increase in 2007 due to borrowings associated with the january 2007 acquisition of hsm for 545 million the earlier discussed net earnings expectations for hsm contemplate the interest costs related to financing the acquisition

net interest expense from continuing operations in 2005 was 34 million consistent with 2004 levels interest expense was held fairly constant in a period of rising interest rates through the maintenance of overall lower debt levels during most of 2005 and application of effective hedging strategies

othernet from continuing operations represented 57 million of expense in 2006 compared to 48 million of expense in 2005 the increase was primarily driven by 9 million of higher intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisition activity a 4 million pension plan curtailment charge in the uk and a 5 million increase in foreign currency losses partially offset by lower environmental expense and decreased losses on the sale of fixed assets

othernet from continuing operations represented 48 million of expense in 2005 an increase of 2 million over 2004 the slight increase was primarily driven by 6 million of higher intangible asset amortization associated with acquisition activity partially offset by lower foreign currency losses

income taxes the company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2006 was 21 as compared to 24 for 2005 and 27 for 2004

the lower effective tax rate in the current year compared to 2005 is driven by the realization of credits against us taxes and the inclusion of the europeanbased facom acquisition additionally 

substantial costs were incurred in 2005 for the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act and such costs were not incurred in 2006 it is anticipated the 2007 effective tax rate will increase to within a 25 to 27 range in part because certain credits affecting the 2006 and 2005 tax rate will not reoccur

the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a higher proportion of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates as well as the recording of a 5 million tax benefit pertaining to the execution of tax planning strategies enabling the reduction of a previously provided valuation allowance on future utilization of certain prior year european net operating losses also a 17 million tax benefit was recorded arising from the final settlement of various tax contingencies based on the resolution of income tax audits in 2005 in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the ‘‘act’’ was signed into law the act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations during 2005 the company repatriated 250 million in foreign earnings and recorded 16 million of tax expense pertaining to the repatriation

discontinued operations net loss from discontinued operations of 1 million in 2006 primarily relates to the previous operating results and loss from the sale of the uk paint decorator tool business in march 2006 in 2005 the company announced the planned sale of two small businesses the uk paint decorator tool business and a small appliance hinge business the operations of these two held for sale businesses along with the resolution of tax and other matters associated with the 2004 divestitures resulted in a net loss from discontinued operations of 2 million in 2005 net earnings from discontinued operations were 130 million in 2004 reflecting a 95 million net gain on the march 2004 sale of the residential entry door business a 24 million net gain on the december 2004 divestiture of the home décor business a 4 million net loss on the sale of a small german paint roller business as well as the operating results of these discontinued operations 

business segment results 

the company’s reportable segments are an aggregation of businesses that have similar products and services among other factors the company utilizes operating profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales sga and allocated corporate and common expenses and operating profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment segment operating profit excludes interest income interest expense othernet intangible asset amortization expense restructuring and asset impairments and income tax expense refer to note o restructuring and asset impairments and note g goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments and intangibles amortization expense respectively attributable to each segment as discussed previously the company’s operations are classified into three business segments consumer products industrial tools and security solutions

consumer products  

 

net sales from continuing operations of consumer products increased 21 in 2006 compared to 2005 of this increase acquisitions predominantly national accounted for 18 while organic volume and price rose 2 and 1 respectively foreign currency did not significantly impact sales the consumer hand tool business continued to achieve share gains from the strong performance of the new fatmax ® xtreme ™ and fatmax ® xl ™ product lines which launched in the us and european markets representing the largest new hand tools product introduction in the company’s history at the same time the fatmax ® range of product offerings delivered growth though continued premium innovation distribution point expansion and related brand support this favorable performance was partially offset by lower volumes in the consumer storage and mechanics tools businesses the prior year sales 

in the consumer storage business reflected higher volume from the initial launch of garage storage products the 110 basis point decline in segment operating margin is primarily due to 8 million of noncash inventory stepup amortization from acquisitions the dilutive impact of national margins due to its legacy highcost manufacturing structure which the company continues to transition to low cost countries increased brand support and commodity cost inflation partially offset by savings derived from price recovery initiatives and prior cost reduction actions

consumer products’ net sales from continuing operations in 2005 represented a 5 increase over 2004 of this 5 increase the november 2005 national acquisition contributed 1 while organic volume increased 3 driven by strength in the hand tools and consumer storage business associated with successful new product introductions the effects of currency and pricing contributed equally to the remaining 1 increase solid organic sales growth was achieved despite an unanticipated inventory correction by certain large north american customers in december 2005 which negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 million versus normal levels operating margin improved 50 basis points primarily due to leverage associated with the increase in sales volume

industrial tools 

 

industrial tools’ net sales increased 32 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by the facom and besco acquisitions which increased sales by 452 million or 33 favorable pricing actions and favorable foreign currency collectively contributed 1 and were more than offset by a core volume decline of 2 the majority of this decrease was due to fastening systems organic sales declining 7 compared to the prior year stemming from weakness in the us construction market and management’s commitment to turn down unprofitable business this decline more than offset strong results in the mac tools facom hydraulic tools industrial tools and storage businesses as organic sales aside from fastening systems increased 3 in 2006 compared to the prior year mac tools’ continues to benefit from improved retention of its distributors based on management actions initiated early in the year industrial tools and storage and the hydraulic tools businesses obtained share gains from the success of new product introductions in the oil and mining industries as demand for such commodities remained strong during 2006 operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 110 basis points due to 13 million of noncash inventory stepup amortization associated with the facom acquisition commodity inflation supply chain inefficiencies in certain businesses due to increased backlog and the sales volume decline and cost inefficiencies experienced by the us fastening systems business partially offset by the accretive impact of facom management is committed to restoring the fastening systems business’ longterm cost competitiveness by continuing the migration of production to asia reducing the overall sga and manufacturing footprint as well as sku rationalization additionally the acquisition of asianbased besco and the opening of a new manufacturing facility in china during 2006 will strategically aid the fastening systems business’ long term vitality

industrial tools’ net sales increased 6 in 2005 from 2004 the carryover effect from the 2004 cstberger and related 2005 acquisitions contributed nearly 1 of the sales increase the 5 organic sales increase was comprised of 3 volume and 2 price sales volume rose on continued strong demand in the industrial mechanics tools hydraulic tools laser leveling tools and storage businesses and to a lesser extent fastening systems these volume gains were partially offset by declines in the mac tools and assembly technologies businesses industrial mechanics tools’ increase in volume was driven by share gains achieved from new product introductions and improved customer service hydraulic tools also benefited from new product introductions as well as higher product demand associated with the steel scrap market which was driven by the strong global demand for steel laser leveling tools continued to increase its market share in the us and european professional markets due to new product offerings although demand began to slow during the latter half of 2005 fastening systems achieved moderate sales growth during 2005 based on demand from the us construction and 

industrial channels along with the success of innovative nail products the storage business increase in volume was driven by the successful launch of a vertical lift module automated storage and retrieval system as well as strong demand experienced in the industrial heavy truck and automotive dealership markets assembly technologies was affected by weakness in the us auto industry as the ‘‘big 3’’ automakers continued to reduce capital expenditures in conjunction with other cost reduction initiatives mac tools sales fell due to a decline in the number of distributors in 2005 compared to 2004 as dealer attrition outpaced recruiting efforts however the average sales per mac tools’ distributor was up 4 versus 2004 and operating margin improved slightly operating profit in 2005 was 136 million or 99 of net sales up slightly compared to 133 million or 103 of net sales in 2004 the 40 basis point decline in the operating margin rate despite the sales volume increase was primarily due to increased freight costs as well as unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business where manufacturing volume was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 on improved inventory management

security solutions 

 

during 2006 security solutions’ sales increased 8 acquisitions contributed 4 organic sales volume 2 pricing 1 and currency 1 the automatic doors business continued to grow its service revenue and achieved strong national account share gains driven by the favorable impact of new product introductions new store openings and increased modernization of preexisting stores the mechanical access business benefited from new product introductions and its expanded ability to provide customers with virtually all of their varied mechanical product needs in addition the security segment as a whole benefited from the growth and continued integration of its national service foot print the 2006 operating margin as a percentage of net sales was consistent with 2005 as the favorable impact from prior cost reduction and integration actions were negated by commodity cost inflation and the dilutive impact of recently acquired companies until integration initiatives unfold

security solutions’ sales increased 24 in 2005 excluding acquisitions organic sales increased 2 sales volume and favorable foreign currency each represented 1 of the organic increase the increase in organic volume was driven by the north american mechanical access and electronic security integration businesses partially offset by declines in the north american automatic door and blick uk security businesses the strong sales volume achieved by the mechanical access business was driven by increased demand from its national accounts based on the continued ability to provide a diversified product offering to such customers while the north american security integration business benefited from strong market conditions the decline in blick was attributable to overall softness in the uk economy while the automatic doors business was negatively impacted by the nonrecurrence of a major project upgrade at a large customer as compared with 2004 acquisitions contributed 17 million of operating profit the operating margin rate decrease is primarily attributed to unfavorable mix as a result of a higher proportion of electronic access sales as compared to mechanical access as well as the impact of recent acquisitions as integration synergies were not yet fully achieved and there was unfavorable impact from nonrecurring inventory stepup costs in purchase accounting however the second half 2005 operating margin was 158 compared to 144 in the first half reflecting the benefit of various cost reduction initiatives including headcount reductions at several of the businesses progress in the integration of field service organizations and back office systems and the continued rollout of the stanley fulfillment system to recently acquired businesses

restructuring activities

financial condition

liquidity sources and uses of capital the company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under various credit facilities

operating and investing activities the company has historically generated strong cash flows from operations in 2006 cash flow from operations was 439 million compared to 362 million in 2005 the 77 million improvement in 2006 versus 2005 is mainly attributable to higher cash earnings on the strength of acquisitions reflecting the removal of increased noncash expenses in 2006 particularly inventory stepup amortization associated with acquisitions intangible asset amortization expense and stockbased compensation expense receivables inventories and accounts payables generated 11 million higher cash inflows in 2006 compared with 2005 due to increased receivable sales these favorable impacts were partially offset by cash outflows for restructuring activities which amounted to 29 million in 2006 an increase of 20 million over 2005 in 2005 operating cash flow totaled 362 million down slightly from 2004

capital expenditures were 80 million in 2006 68 million in 2005 and 55 million in 2004 the higher capital expenditures in 2006 were driven by upgrades of information systems the incremental impact of normal capital spending incurred by recent acquisitions and equipment purchases related to new product introductions the increase in 2005 capital expenditures versus 2004 was due to new product introductions information system upgrades and plant investments in china and thailand the company expects future capital expenditures to increase approximately in proportion to its sales growth

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 359 million in 2006 and 294 million in 2005 considerably exceeding net earnings from continuing operations in a period of continued strong sales volume growth the company believes free cash flow is an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners

 

based on its demonstrated ability to generate cash flow from operations as well as its strong balance sheet and credit position at december 30 2006 the company believes it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareholders’ advantage through a combination of acquisitions dividends debt repayment and potential future share repurchases

in 2006 acquisition spending totaled 572 million primarily related to facom and besco and 20 million of debt repayments associated with the 2004 acquisition of blick 2005 acquisition spending amounted to 287 million principally for the national security group sielox and precision acquisitions discussed previously as part of its portfolio diversification shift in 2004 the company received 205 million in net proceeds from sales of the residential entry door and home décor businesses and disbursed 301 million for business acquisitions in 2005 the 21 million of remaining taxes due on the gain from these business sales were paid pursuant to its profitable growth strategy the company will continue to assess its current business portfolio for disposition opportunities and make acquisitions in favored markets while minimizing the risk associated with large customer concentrations the company likely will complete additional 2007 acquisitions requiring funding of approximately 50 – 75 million aside from hsm which was acquired for 545 million in january 2007

during 2006 the company entered into a saleleaseback transaction of its corporate headquarters building under the terms of the transaction the company received 23 million in cash proceeds reported in investing cash flows and recorded a deferred gain of 11 million which will be amortized over the 15 year operating lease term the cash proceeds were utilized to pay down shortterm borrowings

financing activities the company financed the hsm acquisition with proceeds from existing short term credit facilities and a new 500 million 364day bridge facility entered into on january 8 2007 the company remains committed to its current credit ratings and intends to refinance this transaction with a combination of available cash debt and equitylinked securities which it believes will be consistent with maintaining those ratings management does not anticipate the need to issue common equity in the short term in order to achieve this objective however the above refinancing is expected to entail the issuance of common stock in the medium term

payments on longterm debt amounted to 4 million in 2006 72 million in 2005 and 154 million in 2004 payments in 2004 reflect the maturity of 120 million of debt on march 1 2004 net repayments of shortterm borrowings in 2006 amounted to a cash outflow of 66 million as the company paid down commercial paper utilizing a portion of the strong operating cash flows net shortterm borrowings provided cash inflows of 103 million in 2005 and 20 million in 2004 the increase in 2005 was primarily attributed to commercial paper issued to fund the 2005 acquisitions aside from national

in november 2005 the company consummated a section 144a offering with registration rights of 450 million of enhanced trust preferred securities ‘‘etps’’ through its unconsolidated trust subsidiary the stanley works capital trust i ‘‘the trust’’ contemporaneously the company borrowed the proceeds of the etps offering from the trust by issuing 450 million of junior subordinated debt securities payable to the trust the net proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisitions of national and facom which closed on november 30 2005 and january 1 2006 respectively these securities and underlying junior subordinated debt securities collectively the ‘‘securities’’ feature a 5 year fixed rate period ending december 1 2010 and a floating rate period ending december 1 2045 the fixed coupon was set at 5902 the obligations tenor and terms of the etps mirror those of the junior subordinated debt securities the securities can be redeemed by the company on or after december 1 2010 without penalty for early payment

in 2005 the company amended its longterm multiyear 400 million committed credit facility by increasing the facility size to 550 million and adding a multi currency sublimit of 250 million available in euros or pound sterling this longterm credit facility matures in october 2009 in addition the company has shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 251 million of which 191 million was available at december 30 2006 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal aggregate credit lines amounted to 801 million the 550 million committed credit facility is designated as a liquidity backstop for the company’s commercial paper program as of december 30 2006 there were no outstanding loans under this facility and the company had 31 million of commercial paper outstanding in addition to these lines of credit the company maintains a committed facility designed for the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity as of december 30 2006 the company’s maximum available funds under this arrangement were 87 million of which 60 million was utilized

in 2003 the company filed a shelf registration in the amount of 900 million at december 30 2006 the shelf registration was unutilized this filing represents a prospectus which if accompanied by a prospectus supplement would allow the company to offer issue and sell together or separately debt equity and other securities

in 2006 the company completed a stock repurchase program whereby it repurchased 4 million outstanding shares of its common stock for 200 million the company will continue to assess the possibility of repurchasing more of its outstanding common stock based on a number of factors including the level of acquisition activity the market price of the company’s common stock and the current financial condition of the company

the company’s debt to capital ratio was 39 at the end of 2006 42 at the end of 2005 and 32 at the end of 2004 reflecting the credit protection measures that are incorporated into the terms of the 450 million etps the debt to capital ratio of the company is more fairly represented by apportioning 50 of the etps issuance to equity when making the calculation the resulting debt to 

capital ratio from this apportionment is 30 as of december 30 2006 this adjustment is consistent with the treatment accorded these securities by the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations that rate the company’s debt securities

market risk

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments currencies commodities and other items traded in global markets the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and commodity prices exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi ‘‘rmb’’ and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection primarily purchased basket options the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the company also enters 

into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately for affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into several crosscurrency interest rate swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2006 would have been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all currencies the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes

on july 21 2005 china announced it will allow the rmb to fluctuate within a very tight band − 3 around the weighted average prior day close thereby effectively adopting a managed float and ending its decadeold valuation de facto peg to the us dollar ‘‘usd’’ the initial appreciation was 2 besides the initial move the effect of that policy shift during 2006 was negligible as total appreciation of the rmb versus the usd at year end amounted to only 3 the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the usd the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the present 3 appreciation of the rmb should not generate material cost increases for rmb denominated purchases further appreciation of this or other currencies utilized for procurement could adversely affect profitability in the event significant rmb or other currency appreciation occurs the company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor and euribor rates at december 30 2006 the result of a hypothetical two percentage point increase in shortterm libor and euribor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the pretax profit of the company

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly brass nickel resin aluminum copper zinc steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer pricing actions procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects in 2005 the company experienced approximately 40 million of commodity and energy inflation most of which was recovered through favorable pricing actions such inflation increased costs by approximately 45 million in 2006 which management mitigated through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives if commodity prices fluctuated to reach new historical high levels similar to those experienced in 2004 the company’s exposure could increase from the expected levels for 2007 as previously discussed 

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of management’s discussion and analysis

the assets held by the company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities primarily global stocks and fixedincome securities the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values the company employs a conservative asset allocation as well as investment consultants to mitigate this risk management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate

sales to the home depot amounted to 10 of 2006 consolidated net sales from continuing operations the company has other significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are none that exceed 10 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no material instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating the company has the flexibility to elect deferral of interest payments on its etps obligation for up to 5 years the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy

other matters

environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters

the company accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines which address probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs the liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company believes that any sum it may pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will not have a materially adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity refer to note s contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on environmental liabilities and related cash flows

employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an employee stock ownership plan ‘‘esop’’ under which the ongoing us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released among other factors net esop expense amounted to 2 million in each of the years 2006 2005 and 2004 while the average market value of shares released increased from 4320 in 2004 to 4928 in 2006 other elements of esop expense including a gradual reduction in the number of shares released annually from the trust offset the favorable impact of the higher share price esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company’s common stock declines

new accounting standards refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position

critical accounting estimates preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from 

each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first the company evaluates specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations such as bankruptcy in these cases the company uses its judgment based on the best available facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience

if circumstances change for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete us inventories are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits ‘‘skus’’ to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required the company identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets the company completed acquisitions in 2006 and 2005 valued at 552 million and 289 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company reported 11 billion of goodwill and 298 million of indefinitelived trade names at december 30 2006

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangible asset impairment involves the estimation of fair value the valuation of goodwill also requires the identification and valuation of reporting units the estimates of fair value of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and related reporting units are based on the best information available at the date of assessment which primarily incorporate management assumptions about future cash flows future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities while the company has not recorded goodwill or other intangible asset impairment losses in many years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event expected profitability cash flows or trade name usage change significantly from current estimates

property plant and equipment the company generally values property plant and equipment ‘‘ppe’’ at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company has previously recorded impairment losses related to unused and underutilized assets and such losses may occur in the future

risk insurance to some extent the company self insures for various business exposures for domestic workers’ compensation and product liability the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses ‘‘stop loss’’ insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers’ compensation and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form the basis for workers’ compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary contemplates the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists insurance companies for workers’ compensation and by inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for product liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected future claim payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 30 2006 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate

warranty the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime while certain products carry no warranty further the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available the company believes the liability recorded for expected warranty claims as of december 30 2006 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain items submitted for claims the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability

income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards is 126 million at december 30 2006 and 97 million at december 31 2005 the company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of december 30 2006 amounted to 27 million

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable earnings adjustment in the period in which that determination is made the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information when it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be asserted the company accrues its best estimate of the tax liability inclusive of related interest charges see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the following

receivable securitizations the company has agreements to sell on a revolving basis pools of accounts and notes receivables to a qualified special purpose entity ‘‘qspe’’ which 

qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary the entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable assets and related debt offbalance sheet were both 60 million at december 30 2006 compared to 16 million as of december 31 2005 the company is responsible for servicing these accounts while the qspe bears the risk of noncollection sales of eligible receivables in 2006 amounted to 44 million compared to 5 million in the prior year there were no gains or losses on these sales

synthetic leases the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers and certain personal property predominately vehicles and equipment the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility as of december 30 2006 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were 95 million and 72 million respectively

trust the company owns 100 of the common stock 01 million of the stanley works capital trust i ‘‘the trust’’ which was formed in 2005 to initiate the offering of the 450 million enhanced trust preferred securities ‘‘etps’’ however in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r ‘‘consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51’’ ‘‘fin 46r’’ the trust is not consolidated since the 450 million of junior subordinated debt issued by the company to the trust is reflected on the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2006 consolidation of the trust would have virtually no impact to the company’s results of operations or financial position

continued portfolio transition to security solutions 

the company continues to focus on becoming a global market leader in the security industry annual revenues of the security solutions segment have grown to 818 million or 25 of consolidated sales in 2005 from 105 million or 5 of sales in 2001 key events pertaining to this portfolio transition in the past two years include the following

  aside from acquisition related growth the company also focused on organic growth and the integration of security solutions with the goal of transforming the stand alone acquired businesses into an integrated multisolution security service provider in 2005 and 2004 various process improvement initiatives were initiated including integration of overlapping field service organizations and implementation of certain common back office systems these integration efforts will continue throughout 2006 and 2007

to assist in funding the above acquisitions and to mitigate the risks associated with certain large customer concentrations the company has disposed of the following nonstrategic businesses

   drive further profitable growth in branded tools and hardware 

while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion into security solutions is important the company also recognizes that its branded consumer products and industrial tools businesses while generally strong and profitable today cannot remain so without vigilant attention to growth and vitality management is committed to growing these businesses through a combination of organic and acquisition related growth strategies continuously improving vitality is pursued through product development brand support and relentless focus on global cost competitiveness the following matters affected these businesses

    reinvigorate the stanley brand 

the stanley ® brand is recognized as one of america’s greatest brands and is one of the company’s most valuable assets brand support was increased during 2005 and 2004 including television advertising campaigns associated with new product rollouts continued nascar racing sponsorships as well as more print and webbased advertising promotions that generated approximately one billion brand impressions annually these advertising and marketing campaigns yielded strong results as evidenced by various metrics web traffic increase of 60 sales lead increase of 27 brand awareness increase of 18 and intent to buy increase of 10 the stanley ® brand had the highest unaided hand tools brand awareness in the united states for 2005 and 2004 and was the only brand to show improvement in these surveys in each of the past four years

institutionalize the stanley fulfillment system 

the company continued to rollout its stanley fulfillment system ‘‘sfs’’ which is a continuous operational improvement process committed to increasing customer and shareowner value sfs’s core disciplines consist of striving to achieve perfect quality service excellence optimal cost and environmental health  safety the company applies sfs to many aspects of its business including procurement maximizing customer fill rates acquisition integration and business processes the sfs program helped to mitigate the impact of material price inflation that was experienced in recent years and also to reduce selling general  administrative expense ‘‘sga’’ as a percentage of sales during the past five years

the company expects to continue to execute the above strategies during 2006 with its primary focus on the successful integration of the recent facom tools and national hardware acquisitions

 aside from the strategic commentary above two other matters having a significant impact on the company’s results were inflation and currency exchange rate fluctuations

the company has been negatively impacted by commodity and freight inflation over the past two years which has increased costs by approximately 110 million during such period the company has been able to recover approximately 70 of the cost increase through pricing actions and various cost reduction initiatives as described in more detail in the results of operations section below the company expects to be negatively impacted by inflation during 2006 by approximately 15 – 20 million and has plans to offset this impact through pricing and other actions

in recent years the strengthening of foreign currencies had a favorable impact on the translation of foreign currencydenominated operating results into us dollars it is estimated that the favorable impact of foreign currency translation including acquired companies contributed 004 012 and 013 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this impact was principally from the canadian dollar and asian currencies in 2005 and european currencies in 2004 and 2003 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar may have a significant impact on future earnings either positive or negative

results of operations

below is a summary of the company’s operating results at the consolidated level followed by an overview of business segment performance

net sales from continuing operations were 2997 billion in 2004 as compared to 2486 billion in 2003 a 21 increase excluding acquisitions organic sales increased 11 driven by 6 volume growth improved pricing and favorable foreign currency impact the volume growth was due to increased industrial tool demand from favorable market conditions improved order fulfillment and execution in several businesses strong consumer hand and mechanics tool demand from home center and mass merchant customers and increased security solutions revenues primarily due to automated door products reflecting a major upgrade project at a large customer the 2004 net sales volume performance was achieved in a 52week reporting period versus a 53week reporting period in 2003 favorable foreign currency translation primarily european increased net sales by 2 price increased 3 mainly as a result of the company actively pursuing increases to offset commodity inflation other pricing actions associated with more effective price management routines resulted in an additional 20 – 25 million of benefit

significant charges and credits in 2005 the company recorded a 5 million tax benefit pertaining to the execution of tax planning strategies enabling the reduction of a previously provided valuation allowance on future utilization of certain prior year european net operating losses also a 17 million tax benefit was recorded arising from the final settlement of various tax contingencies based on the resolution of income tax audits in conjunction with the passage of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the company repatriated 250 million in foreign earnings and recorded 16 million of tax expense pertaining to such repatriation

gross profit the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 1181 billion or 36 of net sales in 2005 compared to 1104 billion or 37 of net sales in the prior year the businesses acquired increased gross profit by 52 million the remaining 25 million improvement was primarily attributed to the increase in organic sales volume and continued benefits of the stanley fulfillment system as a percentage of sales the year over year gross margin rate decline primarily stems from unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business and to a lesser extent the impact of recently acquired businesses which possess lower gross margin percentages until integration synergies are realized during 2005 there was carryover of commodity inflation from 2004 which resulted in approximately 40 million of additional costs that were mostly recovered through favorable pricing actions although steel costs have stabilized from prior year levels energy costs and nonferrous commodities continue to escalate and the company expects such inflation to increase 2006 costs by approximately 15 – 20 million which management plans to mitigate through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives

gross profit from continuing operations was 1104 billion or 37 of net sales in 2004 compared to 850 million or 34 of net sales in the prior year the businesses acquired increased gross profit by 105 million the remaining 149 million improvement was primarily attributed to increased sales volume discussed previously gross margin rate improvement and 20 million of inventory losses recorded in 2003 related to the termination of the macdirect distribution model and the planned consolidation of two major distribution facilities in conjunction with operation 15 the gross margin rate improvement was attributable to the carryover benefit of 2003 restructuring programs volume leverage favorable pricing and improved product mix these benefits were partially offset by higher steel costs and other inflation the company experienced a significant impact from unusually high levels of commodity price inflation particularly steel in 2004 the company had actively pursued price increases in many business channels to partially offset this negative impact the effect of commodity inflation and freight increases was approximately 75 million in 2004 of which approximately 60 was offset with related price increases to customers

sga expenses selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts were 737 million or 22 of net sales in 2005 compared to 691 million or 23 of net sales in the prior year the increase of 46 million mainly pertains to acquired businesses that increased costs by 34 million and 14 million of increased brand support excluding acquisitions sga as a percentage of sales decreased 50 basis points compared with 2004 levels despite the higher brand support expense due to sales volume leverage lower sarbanesoxley compliance costs and effective cost controls

selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts were 691 million or 23 of net sales in 2004 compared to 613 million or 25 of net sales in the prior year the increase of 78 million was primarily attributed to acquired businesses that increased costs by 62 million higher business portfolio sga spending levels in connection with 

the strong organic net sales increase increased funding for brand support sarbanesoxley compliance costs and foreign currency translation additional factors impacting this comparison were accounts receivable losses of 25 million which related to the exiting of the macdirect distribution model and 8 million of costs pertaining to the retirement of the companys former ceo both of which were recorded in 2003

interest and othernet net interest expense from continuing operations in 2005 was 34 million consistent with 2004 levels interest expense was held fairly constant in a period of rising interest rates through the maintenance of overall lower debt levels during most of 2005 and application of effective hedging strategies

net interest expense from continuing operations in 2004 was 34 million an increase of 6 million over 2003 this increase was driven by higher borrowings associated with the acquisitions discussed previously partially offset by lower interest rates on a year over year basis

othernet from continuing operations represented 48 million of expense in 2005 an increase of 2 million over 2004 the slight increase was primarily driven by 6 million of higher intangible asset amortization associated with acquisition activity partially offset by lower foreign currency losses

othernet from continuing operations represented 46 million of expense in 2004 an increase of 7 million from expense of 39 million in 2003 the increase is primarily the result of increased intangible amortization expense of 10 million associated with recent acquisitions additionally there was a significant cost increase and decrease which offset one another — a 10 million increase in currency losses from 2003 levels was offset by reduced losses on the macadvantage finance program in 2004 versus 2003

income taxes the company’s effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2005 was 24 as compared to 27 for 2004 and 25 for 2003

the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 compared to 2004 reflects a higher proportion of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates as well as the recording of a 5 million tax benefit pertaining to the execution of tax planning strategies enabling the reduction of a previously provided valuation allowance on future utilization of certain prior year european net operating losses also a 17 million tax benefit was recorded arising from the final settlement of various tax contingencies based on the resolution of income tax audits in 2005 in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the ‘‘act’’ was signed into law the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate foreign earnings by providing an 85 percent deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations during 2005 the company repatriated 250 million in foreign earnings and recorded 16 million of tax expense pertaining to the repatriation

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2004 compared to 2003 relates to 2003 operation 15 charges which were predominately us based and favorable foreign tax developments that reduced income taxes by 2 million in 2003 also affecting the comparison is an 8 million credit to income taxes that was recorded in 2004 as a result of favorable resolutions of tax audits increased utilization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and specific acquisition taxplanning activities

discontinued operations in 2005 the company announced the planned sale of two small businesses the uk paint decorator tool business and a small appliance hinge business accordingly their results have been classified in discontinued operations in all periods the operations of these two small held for sale businesses along with the resolution of tax and other matters associated with the 2004 divestitures resulted in a net loss from discontinued operations of 2 million in 2005 net earnings from discontinued operations were 130 million in 2004 reflecting a 95 million net gain on the march 2004 sale of the residential entry door business a 24 million net gain on the december 2004 divestiture of the home décor business a 4 million net loss on the sale of a small german paint roller business as well as the operating results of these discontinued operations net earnings from discontinued operations were 20 million in 2003 based on the operating results of the above businesses principally residential entry door and home décor

business segment results 

the company’s reportable segments are an aggregation of businesses that have similar products and services among other factors the company utilizes operating profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and sga inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts and allocated corporate and common expenses and operating profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment segment operating profit excludes interest income interest expense othernet restructuring charges and asset impairments and income tax expense refer to note o restructuring and asset impairments and note g goodwill customer relationships and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of restructuring charges and asset impairments and intangibles amortization expense respectively attributable to each segment the companys operations are classified into three business segments consumer products industrial tools and security solutions the consumer products segment manufactures and markets hand tools consumer mechanics tools storage units and hardware these products are sold to retailers including home centers mass merchants hardware stores and lumber yards as well as through third party distributors the industrial tools segment manufactures and markets professional mechanic tools and storage systems pneumatic tools and fasteners assembly tool systems specialty tools hydraulic tools and accessories and electronic leveling and measuring tools these products are sold to customers and distributed either directly or through third party distributors the security solutions segment manufactures integrates and markets automatic doors door locking systems door closers and exit devices commercial hardware and security access control and surveillance systems primarily through various direct sales forces in the us canada and the uk

consumer products  

 

consumer products net sales from continuing operations in 2005 represented a 5 increase from 2004 of this 5 increase the november 2005 national acquisition contributed 1 while organic volume increased 3 driven by strength in the hand tools and consumer storage business associated with successful new product introductions the effects of currency and pricing contributed equally to the remaining 1 increase solid organic sales growth was achieved despite an unanticipated inventory correction by certain large north american customers in december 2005 which negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 million versus normal levels these customer inventory corrections continued to impact sales in january 2006 as expected the customer actions were broadbased and generally not a result of performance issues with the company’s products however it is expected that normal ordering patterns by these large north american customers will be realized in due course as the retail sell through of products to the end user customers continues to be strong and is outpacing shipments to the home centers in february 2006 orders from and shipments to these customers were robust and more consistent with the companys retail sell through levels operating margin improved 50 basis points primarily due to leverage associated with the increase in sales volume

consumer products net sales from continuing operations in 2004 represented a 12 increase from 2003 driven by the aforementioned strength in home center and mass merchant channels in the us and favorable currency impacts in europe of this 12 increase volume represented 7 which was driven by growth in the hand tools consumer mechanics tools and storage businesses as a result of improved order fulfillment increased brand support and higher market demand which was partially offset by volume declines in the hardware business currency contributed 4 and pricing 1 of the net sales increase operating margin improved 60 basis points primarily due to improved operating leverage from higher sales volumes pricing and favorable product mix however these factors were partially offset by the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation primarily steel and resin increased brand support and sarbanesoxley compliance costs additionally 2003 consumer products operating profit was impacted by 3 million in operation 15 charges previously mentioned

industrial tools 

 

industrial tools net sales increased 6 from 2004 the carryover effect from the 2004 cstberger and related 2005 acquisitions contributed nearly 1 of the sales increase the 5 organic sales increase was comprised of 3 volume and 2 price sales volume rose on continued strong demand in the industrial mechanics tools hydraulic tools laser leveling tools and storage businesses and to a lesser extent fastening systems these volume gains were partially offset by declines in the mac tools and assembly technologies businesses industrial mechanics tools’ increase in volume was driven by share gains achieved from new product introductions and improved customer service hydraulic tools also benefited from new product introductions as well as higher product demand associated with the steel scrap market which was driven by the strong global demand for steel laser leveling tools continued to increase its market share in the us and european professional markets due to new product offerings although demand began to slow during the latter half of 2005 fastening systems achieved moderate sales growth during 2005 based on demand from the us construction and industrial channels along with the success of innovative nail products the storage business increase in volume was driven by the successful launch of a vertical lift module automated storage and retrieval system as well as strong demand experienced in the industrial heavy truck and automotive dealership markets assembly technologies was affected by weakness in the us auto industry as the ‘‘big 3’’ automakers continued to reduce capital expenditures in conjunction with other cost reduction initiatives mac tools sales fell due to a decline in the number of distributors in 2005 compared to 2004 as dealer attrition outpaced recruiting efforts however the average sales per mac tools’ distributor was up 4 versus 2004 and operating margin improved slightly operating profit in 2005 was 136 million or 99 of net sales up slightly compared to 133 million or 103 of net sales in 2004 the 40 basis point decline in the operating margin rate despite the sales volume increase was primarily due to increased freight costs as well as unfavorable mix and cost absorption in the fastening business where manufacturing volume was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 on improved inventory management

industrial tools net sales increased 18 in 2004 from 2003 excluding the cstberger acquisition organic sales increased 12 volume represented 6 of the organic sales increase and price and currency were 4 and 2 respectively this organic volume improvement was the result of better economic conditions improved management execution in several businesses and improved order fulfillment related to industrial mechanic tool assembly tool specialty tool and hydraulic tool products mac tools net sales decreased 4 as sluggish market conditions impacted this business in the fourth quarter of 2004 combined with traditional distributor additions and higher route average sales only partially offsetting the anticipated decline from the previous years macdirect exit the majority of the price increase was due to the company’s actions in response to commodity inflation as previously discussed the significant improvement in the 2004 operating profit and margin rate is the result of charges in 2003 totaling 52 million mainly from receivable and inventory losses associated with the macdirect exit as well as higher sales volume substantial improvement in the margin performances of mac tools and industrial mechanics tools as a result of the carryover benefits from prior year restructuring programs and the acquisition of cstberger these favorable factors were partially offset by the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation as approximately twothirds of the total company’s commodity inflation net of price recovery impacted this segment and sarbanesoxley compliance costs

security solutions 

 

security solutions sales increased 24 in 2005 excluding acquisitions organic sales increased 2 sales volume and favorable foreign currency each represented 1 of the organic increase the increase in organic volume was driven by the north american mechanical access and electronic security integration businesses offset by declines in the north american automatic door and blick uk security businesses the strong sales volume achieved by the mechanical access business was driven by increased demand from its national accounts based on the continued ability to provide a diversified product offering to such customers while the north american security integration business benefited from improved coordination in sales and marketing activities due to the reorganization of the system integration commercial team in early 2005 the decline in blick was attributable to overall softness in the uk economy while the automatic doors business was negatively impacted by the nonrecurrence of a major project upgrade at a large customer as compared with 2004 acquisitions contributed 17 million of operating profit the operating margin rate decrease is primarily attributed to unfavorable mix as a result of a higher proportion of electronic access sales as compared to mechanical access as well as the impact of recent acquisitions as integration synergies were not yet fully achieved and there was unfavorable impact from nonrecurring inventory stepup costs in purchase accounting however the second half 2005 operating margin was 158 compared to 144 in the first half reflecting the benefit of various cost reduction initiatives including headcount reductions at several of the businesses progress in the integration of field service organizations and back office systems and the continued rollout of the stanley fulfillment system to recently acquired businesses based on the relative size of the security solutions segment compared to the remainder of the business portfolio and the dynamic nature of its growth activities as well as the seasonal nature of this business management expects continued operating margin volatility on a quarterly basis however management also believes that this segment will continue to produce above company average operating margins when viewed over the course of several quarters

security solutions sales increased 44 in 2004 excluding acquisitions primarily blick frisco bay and isr organic sales increased 6 sales volume represented 4 of the organic increase and price was 2 the organic volume improvement was due to strength in the supply and service of automatic commercial door systems in access technologies best access sales volume was virtually unchanged compared to 2003 levels while incoming orders increased reflecting a shift in mix toward longer order cycle electronic access systems the operating profit increase is primarily attributed to the impact of 2004 acquisitions operating margin was relatively flat versus 2003 primarily attributable to favorable business mix and pricing actions with customers which were offset by increased commodity inflation field productivity issues at best access sarbanesoxley compliance costs and strategic consulting expenditures

restructuring activities

at december 31 2005 the restructuring and asset impairment reserve balance was 5 million which the company expects to be fully expended by the end of 2006 a summary of the company’s restructuring reserves for the years ended january 1 2005 to december 31 2005 is as follows

 

for the three years ended december 31 2005 27 facilities have been closed as a result of restructuring initiatives in 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 219 160 and 1100 employees have been terminated as a result of restructuring initiatives respectively severance payments of 6 million 4 million and 18 million and other exit costs of 1 million 4 million and 10 million were made in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively writeoffs of impaired assets were 2 million 11 million and 18 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

acquisition related integration of certain acquisitions requires reduction of redundant personnel closure of facilities and other restructuring actions related to the acquired businesses in such cases a restructuring accrual is recorded for actions identified in integration strategy plans initially developed by the company as of the acquisition date with a resulting increase to goodwill as integration strategies are executed the company monitors the previously established restructuring accruals and makes adjustments to such accruals to the extent actual expenditures differ from the estimated accruals adjustments recorded to previously established restructuring accruals until the time integration plans are fully executed not to exceed one year from date of original acquisition are reflected in the final goodwill amount included in the purchase price allocation adjustments made subsequent to the finalization of integration strategies or after one year from the date of original acquisition are reflected in the company’s results of operations if increases to the accruals are required while decreases in such accruals are appropriately applied against goodwill

in january 2006 the company announced a cost reduction initiative relating primarily to the severance of approximately 540 employees across multiple businesses the majority of the cost reduction actions will be executed in the first quarter of 2006 providing approximately 40 million of cost savings in 2006 a charge totaling approximately 16 million is expected to be recorded in 2006 in connection with this initiative

the company anticipates approximately 30 million – 40 million of cash expenditures will be incurred between 2006 and 2007 in relation to integration of the facom and national acquisitions the majority of this restructuring is expected to be reflected in the purchase price allocation

financial condition

liquidity sources and uses of capital  undefinedthe company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under various credit facilities

operating and investing activities the company has historically generated strong cash flows from operations in 2005 cash flow from operations was 362 million relatively flat as compared to 372 million in 2004 in 2004 cash flow from operations was 372 million as compared to 464 million in 2003 working capital improvements were 45 million higher in 2003 as compared with 2004 in addition in 2003 there were favorable impacts of 57 million for income tax deferrals and refunds as well as approximately 40 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the mac tools distributor financing portfolio which did not recur in 2004 these items were partially offset by improved net earnings from continuing operations and lower cash payments related to restructuring and other charges in 2004 versus 2003

capital expenditures were 68 million in 2005 55 million in 2004 and 39 million in 2003 the increase in 2005 capital expenditures versus 2004 was due to new product introductions information system upgrades and plant investments in china and thailand the company incurred higher capital expenditures in 2004 compared to 2003 for investment in various plants including manufacturing productivity projects movement of production to low cost countries and increased costs for software development and acquisitions the company expects future capital expenditures to increase approximately in proportion to its sales growth

free cash flow as defined in the following table was 294 million in 2005 and 317 million in 2004 considerably exceeding net earnings from continuing operations in a period of continued strong sales volume growth the company believes free cash flow is an important measure of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a dividend to shareowners

 

based on its demonstrated ability to generate free cash flow and its strong debt to capital ratio at december 31 2005 the company believes it has the financial flexibility to deploy capital to its shareholders advantage through a combination of acquisitions share repurchases dividends and debt repayment

in 2005 acquisition spending totaled 287 million principally for the national hardware security group and precision businesses as previously mentioned as part of its portfolio diversification shift the company received 205 million in net proceeds from sales of the residential entry door and home décor businesses in 2004 and disbursed 301 million for business acquisitions in 2005 the 21 million of remaining taxes due on the gain from these business sales were paid pursuant to its profitable growth strategy the company will continue to assess its current business portfolio for disposition opportunities and make acquisitions in favored markets while minimizing the risk associated with large customer concentrations currently the company expects to complete additional 2006 acquisitions requiring funding of approximately 100 – 200 million aside from facom which was acquired for 486 million on january 1 2006 however if the opportunity arises to acquire a target that meets strategic objectives at an attractive price management will consider exceeding this anticipated 2006 acquisition spending level within the constraints of its ongoing commitment to maintain uppertier investment grade credit ratings

financing activities in november 2005 the company consummated a section 144a offering with registration rights of 450 million of enhanced trust preferred securities ‘‘etps debt’’ through its unconsolidated trust subsidiary the stanley works capital trust i ‘‘the trust’’ contemporaneously the company borrowed the proceeds of the etps offering from the trust by issuing 450 million of junior subordinated debt securities payable to the trust the net proceeds were used to partially fund 

the acquisitions of national and facom which closed on november 30 2005 and january 1 2006 respectively these securities and underlying junior subordinated debt securities collectively the ‘‘securities’’ feature a 5 year fixed rate period ending december 1 2010 and floating rate period ending december 1 2045 the fixed coupon was set at 5902 the obligations tenor and terms of the etps mirror those of the junior subordinated debt securities the securities can be redeemed by the company on or after december 1 2010 without penalty for early payment

payments on longterm debt amounted to 72 million in 2005 154 million in 2004 and 18 million in 2003 payments in 2004 reflect the maturity of 120 million of debt on march 1 2004 net proceeds from short term borrowings amounted to cash inflows of 103 million in 2005 and 20 million in 2004 and a cash outflow of 141 million in 2003 the increase in 2005 was primarily attributed to commercial paper issued to fund the 2005 acquisitions aside from national

in 2003 the company repurchased 39 million shares of common stock and agreed to settle the remainder of its equity hedge through the repurchase of 41 million shares over the succeeding four years the 39 million share repurchase was made with 100 million of cash and increased commercial paper borrowings while the 41 million share repurchase involved 113 million of term debt no open market purchase of shares occurred in 2005 the company paid 71 million to purchase the remaining 25 million shares of common stock which settled the remaining portion of the equity hedge

the company’s debt to capital ratio was 424 at the end of 2005 321 at the end of 2004 and 432 at the end of 2003 reflecting the credit protection measures that are incorporated into the terms of the 450 million etps the debt to capital ratio of the company is more fairly represented by apportioning 50 of the etps issuance to equity when making the calculation the resulting debt to capital ratio from this apportionment is 335 this adjustment is consistent with the treatment accorded these securities by internationally recognized bond ratings agencies

the company increased its cash dividend per common share to 114 in 2005 which resulted in 6 million of additional dividend payments compared to 2004 dividends per common share increased 55 in 2005 49 in 2004 and 40 in 2003

in january 2006 the company announced the commencement of a stock repurchase program whereby approximately 200 million will be expended to repurchase outstanding shares of the companys common stock the repurchase program is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 and provide a 2006 fully diluted earnings per share benefit of approximately 010 – 015 the company will continue to assess the possibility of repurchasing more of its outstanding common stock based on a number of factors including the level of acquisition activity the market price of the company’s common stock and the current financial condition of the company

in 2005 the company amended its longterm multiyear 400 million credit facility by increasing the facility size to 550 million and adding a multi currency sublimit of 250 million available in euros or pound sterling this longterm credit facility matures in october 2009 in addition the company has shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 184 million of which 155 million was available at december 31 2005 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal of the 734 million aggregate credit lines 400 million is allocated to support the company’s commercial paper program in addition to these lines of credit the company maintains a facility designed for the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity as of december 31 2005 the company’s maximum available funds under this arrangement were 123 million of which 16 million was utilized

in 2003 the company filed a shelf registration in the amount of 900 million at december 31 2005 the shelf registration was unutilized this filing represents a prospectus which if accompanied by a prospectus supplement would allow the company to offer issue and sell together or separately debt equity and other securities

the company also has numerous assets predominantly vehicles and equipment under a oneyear term renewable us master personal property lease residual value obligations which approximate the fair value of the related assets under this master lease were 257 million at december 31 2005 the company does not anticipate any material liabilities associated with these transactions

market risk

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the company’s predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies including the chinese renminbi ‘‘rmb’’ and the taiwan dollar certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate crossborder activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection primarily purchased options the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into several crosscurrency interest rate swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2005 would have been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all currencies the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions and does not use such instruments for speculative or hedging purposes

on july 21 2005 china announced it will allow the rmb fluctuate within a very tight band  3 around weighted average prior day close thereby effectively adopting a managed float and ending its 

decadeold valuation de facto peg to the us dollar ‘‘usd’’ the initial appreciation was 2 besides the initial move the effect of that policy shift during 2005 was negligible as total appreciation of the rmb versus the usd at year end amounted to only 26 the company sources significant products from china and other asian low cost countries for resale in other regions to the extent the rmb or these other currencies appreciate with respect to the usd the company may experience cost increases on such purchases while the present 3 appreciation of the rmb should not generate material cost increases for rmb denominated purchases further appreciation of this or other currencies utilized for procurement could adversely affect profitability in the event significant rmb or other currency appreciation occurs the company would initiate customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases but it is possible such actions would not fully offset the potential unfavorable impact

the company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps the company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor and euribor rates at december 31 2005 the result of a hypothetical two percentage point increase in shortterm libor and euribor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the pretax profit of the company

the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses particularly certain base metals aluminum copper zinc and steel and energy used in the production of finished goods generally commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments but instead are actively managed through customer pricing actions and procurementdriven cost reduction initiatives in 2004 the company experienced around 75 million of commodity and energy inflation especially steel of which approximately 60 was offset with related price increases to customers in 2005 the company experienced approximately 40 million of commodity and energy inflation most of which was recovered through favorable pricing actions such inflation is expected to increase costs by an estimated 15 – 20 million in 2006 which management plans to mitigate through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives if commodity prices fluctuated to reach new historical high levels similar to those experienced in 2004 the company’s exposure could increase by 40 – 50 million above the current expected levels for 2006 in that unlikely event the company would pursue pricing and other actions to limit the net impact from inflation to an amount around or below the approximate 30 million unfavorable inflation impact net of pricing actions experienced in 2004 an unlikely change of this magnitude would reflect external factors that would impact other companies in our industry as well as the broader economy

fluctuations in the fair value of the company’s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the us pension and esop section of management discussion and analysis

sales to the home depot amounted to 12 of 2005 consolidated net sales from continuing operations the company has other significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are no others that exceed 10 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no material instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating and no significantly restrictive covenants the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows committed longterm credit facilities and borrowing capacity provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy

other matters

environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company’s expenditures related to routine environmental matters

the company accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines which address probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs the liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company believes that any sum it may pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will not have a materially adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity refer to note s contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on environmental liabilities and related cash flows

us pension and esop as detailed in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the company has an employee stock ownership plan ‘‘esop’’ under which the ongoing us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released in 2005 the market value of shares released averaged 4641 per share and the net esop expense was 2 million in 2004 the market value of shares released averaged 4320 per share and the net esop expense was 2 million in 2003 the market value of shares released averaged 2925 per share and the net esop expense was 9 million esop expense may vary in the future as the market value of the company’s common stock fluctuates

new accounting standards refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position

critical accounting estimates preparation of the company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first the company evaluates specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations such as bankruptcy in these cases the company uses its judgment based on the 

best available facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience

if circumstances change for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete us inventories are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits ‘‘skus’’ to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required the company identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value then cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost then the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets the company completed acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 valued at 289 million and 320 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method at their fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company had recorded goodwill of 741 million and 107 million of indefinitelived trade names at december 31 2005

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangible asset impairment involves the estimation of fair value the valuation of goodwill also requires the identification and valuation of reporting units the estimates of fair value of goodwill indefinite lived intangible assets and related reporting units are based on the best information available at the date of assessment which primarily incorporate management assumptions about future cash flows future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities while the company has not recorded goodwill and intangible impairment losses in several years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event expected profitability cash flows or trade name usage change significantly from current estimates

property plant and equipment the company generally values property plant and equipment ‘‘ppe’’ at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company has recorded impairment losses related to unused assets and additional such losses may occur in the future

risk insurance to some extent the company self insures for various business exposures for domestic workers’ compensation and product liability the company generally purchases outside 

insurance coverage only for severe losses ‘‘stop loss’’ insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers’ compensation and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company’s products actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form the basis for workers’ compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary contemplates the company’s specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists insurance companies for workers’ compensation and by inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for product liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected future claim payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of december 31 2005 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate

income taxes the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards is 97 million at december 31 2005 and 73 million at january 1 2005 the company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of december 31 2005 amounted to 27 million

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable earnings adjustment in the period in which that determination is made

the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information when it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be asserted the company accrues its best estimate of the tax liability inclusive of related interest charges see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include the following

receivable securitizations the company has agreements to sell on a revolving basis pools of accounts and notes receivables to a qualified special purpose entity ‘‘qspe’’ which qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary the entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable assets and related debt offbalance sheet were both 16 million at december 31 2005 compared to 12 million as of january 1 2005 the company is responsible for servicing these accounts while the qspe bears the risk of noncollection sales of eligible receivables in 2005 amounted to 5 million compared to none in the prior year as the securitization was reduced by 42 million during 2004

in 2003 the company acquired a third party’s interest in a special purpose entity ‘‘spe’’ which supported the mac tools extended financing programs as a result the entity became nonqualifying and the net assets which consisted primarily of notes receivable of 56 million at january 3 2004 were consolidated in the company’s balance sheet no gains or losses related to sales to the spe were recorded during 2003 the company sold 39 million of receivables in this portfolio to a third party 

in 2004 the majority of the remaining portfolio was sold without recourse for approximately 50 million and the spe was dissolved by the end of 2004 both mac tools extended financing programs were largely outsourced and the majority of the related portfolios sold lowering but not eliminating the ongoing credit risk however the company is currently providing financing to new distributors for their initial working capital needs and purchase of the truck as of december 31 2005 such notes receivable from distributors amounted to 8 million net of the related allowance for doubtful accounts

synthetic leases the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility as of december 31 2005 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these two properties were 48 million and 40 million respectively

trust the company owns 100 of the common stock 01 million of the stanley works capital trust i ‘‘the trust’’ which was formed in 2005 to initiate the offering of the 450 million enhanced trust preferred securities ‘‘etps debt’’ however in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46r ‘‘consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51’’ ‘‘fin 46r’’ the trust is not consolidated since the junior subordinated debt issued by the company to the trust is reflected on the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 consolidation of the trust would have virtually no impact to the company’s results of operations or financial position

competition

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands its commitment to customer service and strong customer relationships the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product innovation

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that often offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware business who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the companys the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines within a particular line the company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line than any other toolmaker the company also believes that it is a leader in the manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners to the construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of handheld hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroads utilities and public works the company also believes that it is among the largest security integration service providers in north america

customers

a substantial portion of the companys products in the consumer products and industrial tools segments are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us in 2004 sales to the home depot were 12 of the companys consolidated sales from continuing operations a consolidation of retailers both in north america and abroad has occurred over time while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of the customer referred to above as well as certain of the other larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse 

effect on each of the companys business segments until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has a diversified customer base and has decreased this potential risk over the past years as sales from continuing operations in markets outside of the home center and mass merchant distribution channel have grown at a greater rate through a combination of efforts to broaden the customer base primarily in the security solutions and industrial tools segments

raw materials

the companys products are manufactured of steel aluminum and other metals as well as wood and plastic the raw materials required are available from a number of sources at competitive prices and the company has annual contracts with some of its key suppliers the company has occasionally experienced difficulties in obtaining supplies in recent periods mainly for steel products certain commodity prices particularly steel may increase in 2005 but the company does not anticipate difficulties with respect to adequate supplies of raw materials

backlog

due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover in many of the companys businesses backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance at february 6 2005 the company had approximately 279 million in unfilled orders compared with 284 million in unfilled orders at march 6 2004 all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result the company produces primarily for inventory rather than to fill specific orders

patents and trademarks

no business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the business segments the company owns numerous patents none of which are material to the companys operations as a whole these patents expire at various times over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the companys operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in duration but generally run from one to 20 years

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide the stanley® and stanley in a notched rectangle design trademarks are material to all three business segments these wellknown trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are among the worlds most trusted brand names the companys tagline make something great tm  is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for all segments in the consumer products and industrial tools segments the bostitch® powerlock® tape rule case design powerlock fatmax® labounty® mac® proto® jensen® goldblatt® husky® vidmar® cst® and zag® trademarks are also material to these segments in the security solutions segment the best® blick frisco bay® and isr tm trademarks are also material to this segment the terms of these trademarks vary from one to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms

environmental regulations

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the companys expenditures related to environmental matters

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially responsible party prp in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including ten active superfund sites

current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following the solvency of the other prps whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the fact that its volumetric contribution if any at these sites is relatively small

the companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of january 1 2005 the company had reserves of approximately 136 million primarily for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

employees

at january 1 2005 the company had approximately 14100 employees nearly 7500 of whom were employed in the us approximately 765 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 14 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the companys hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the companys labor agreements in the us expire in 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 with the exception of an eleven day strike in new britain and farmington connecticut in 2003 there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the companys operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is very good

othernet from continuing operations represented 47 million of expense in 2004 an increase of nearly 8 million from expense of 39 million in 2003 the increase is primarily the result of increased intangible amortization expense of 10 million associated with recent acquisitions additionally there was a significant cost increase and decrease which offset one another – a 10 million increase in currency losses from 2003 levels was offset by reduced losses on the macadvantage finance program in 2004 versus 2003

othernet from continuing operations was 39 million in expense for 2003 compared to 9 million in income for 2002 the increase in costs is primarily the result of an 18 million gain in 2002 from the us pension settlement 12 million of higher losses in 2003 related to the companys macadvantage financing program a 6 million loss on the sale of the mac tools distributor receivable portfolio an operation 15 initiative in 2003 increased intangible amortization expense of 10 million in 2003 associated with acquisitions and 11 million in income from an environmental settlement with an insurance carrier in 2002 which was slightly offset by a 2 million increase in other environmental expense

consumer products net sales from continuing operations in 2004 represented a 12 increase from 2003 driven by the aforementioned strength in home center and mass merchant channels in the us and favorable currency impacts in europe of this 12 increase volume represented 7 which was driven by growth in hand tools consumer mechanics tools and storage units as a result of improved order fulfillment increased brand support and higher market demand which was partially offset by volume declines in hardware products currency represented 4 and pricing 1 of the net sales increase operating margin improved 70 basis points primarily due to improved operating leverage from higher sales volumes pricing and favorable product mix however these factors were partially offset by the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation primarily steel and resin increased brand support and sarbanesoxley compliance costs additionally 2003 consumer products operating profit was impacted by 3 million in operation 15 charges previously mentioned

consumer products net sales from continuing operations in 2003 increased 5 as compared to 2002 the sales increased primarily from favorable foreign currency translation due mainly to european currencies the volume increased slightly as a result of strong fourth quarter 2003 demand in the us hand tools business which was offset partially by consumer channel customers inventory corrections in the first half of 2003 consumer products operating profit was impacted by the charges previously mentioned totaling 3 million in 2003 and 6 million in 2002 the remaining 16 million increase in 

operating profit is primarily due to improved shift in business mix and favorable material and productivity variances partially offset by higher retirement plan costs and further price erosion in 2003 versus 2002

 

industrial tools net sales increased 18 from 2003 excluding the cstberger acquisition organic sales increased 12 volume represented 6 of the organic sales increase and price and currency were 4 and 2 respectively this organic volume improvement was the result of better economic conditions improved management execution in several businesses and improved order fulfillment related to industrial mechanic tool assembly tool specialty tool and hydraulic tool products mac tools net sales decreased 4 as sluggish market conditions impacted this business in the fourth quarter of 2004 combined with traditional distributor additions and higher route average sales only partially offsetting the anticipated decline from last years macdirect exit the majority of the price increase was due to the companys actions in response to commodity inflation as previously discussed the significant improvement in the 2004 operating profit and margin rate is the result of charges in 2003 totaling 52 million mainly from receivable and inventory losses associated with the macdirect exit as well as higher sales volume substantial improvement in the margin performances of mac tools and industrial mechanics tools as a result of the carryover benefits from prior year restructuring programs and the acquisition of cstberger these favorable factors were partially offset by the previously mentioned commodity cost inflation as approximately twothirds of the total companys commodity inflation net of price recovery impacted this segment and sarbanesoxley compliance costs

industrial tools net sales in 2003 decreased 1 as compared to 2002 the sales volume decreased as a result of declining sales from the termination of the macdirect program under the operation 15 initiative and industrial channel customers inventory corrections in the first half of 2003 offset partially by strong fourth quarter 2003 demand in the us mechanics tools business and favorable foreign currency translation due primarily to the european currencies industrial tools operating profit was impacted by the charges previously mentioned totaling 52 million in 2003 and 21 million in 2002 the remaining 21 million decrease in 2003 operating profit is primarily due to significant price erosion and lack of manufacturing productivity primarily in the fastening business unfavorable shifts in business mix and higher retirement plan costs

 

security solutions sales increased 43 in 2004 excluding the acquisitions primarily blick plc frisco bay industries ltd and isr solutions inc organic sales increased 6 sales volume represented 4 of the organic increase and price was 2 the organic volume improvement was due to strength in the supply and service of automatic commercial door systems in access technologies best access sales volume was virtually unchanged compared to 2003 levels while incoming orders increased reflecting a shift in mix toward longer order cycle electronic access systems the operating profit increase is primarily attributed to the impact of 2004 acquisitions operating margin was relatively flat versus 2003 primarily attributable to favorable business mix and pricing actions with customers these favorable impacts were offset by increased commodity inflation field productivity issues at best access sarbanesoxley compliance costs and key strategic consulting expenditures

security solutions sales increased by 262 million in 2003 excluding the impact of acquisitions primarily best access totaling 255 million security solutions organic sales increased 3 and volume generated the majority of this increase the organic volume improvement was due to strength 

in the supply and service of automatic commercial door systems in access technologies partially offset by market share declines in the commercial hardware product line operating profit increased significantly primarily as a result of acquisitions

financial condition

liquidity sources and uses of capital the companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under various credit facilities

the company has historically generated strong cash flows from operations in 2004 cash flow from operations was 372 million as compared to 464 million in 2003 working capital improvements were 45 million higher in 2003 as compared with 2004 in addition in 2003 there were favorable impacts of 57 million for income tax deferrals and refunds as well as approximately 40 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the mac tools distributor financing portfolio which did not reoccur in 2004 these items were partially offset by improved net earnings from continuing operations and lower cash payments related to restructuring and other charges in 2004 versus 2003

in 2003 cash flow from operations was 464 million as compared to 285 million in 2002 the increase is the result of working capital improvements of 32 million as compared to 2002 improvements primarily from receivables and inventories cash proceeds of approximately 40 million from the sale of the mac tools distributor financing portfolio income tax payment deferrals and refunds aggregating 57 million and 17 million in lower cash payments related to restructuring and other charges in 2003 versus 2002

capital expenditures were 55 million in 2004 39 million in 2003 and 52 million in 2002 the company incurred higher capital expenditures in 2004 for investment in various plants including manufacturing productivity projects movement of production to low cost countries and increased costs for software development and acquisitions as the company continues to improve the infrastructure of its systems

free cash flow as defined in the table below was 317 million in 2004 and 425 million in 2003 considerably exceeding net earnings from continuing operations in a period of continued strong sales volume growth the company believes free cash flow is an important measure of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide a return to the shareowners

 

the company received net proceeds from sales of the residential entry door and home décor businesses of 205 million in 2004 and disbursed 301 million for business acquisitions additionally as a result of the previously mentioned strong free cash flow from operations the company made 133 million in net payments on borrowings resulting in a 2004 year end 324 debt to capital ratio this ratio was 436 at the end of 2003 the company believes it has achieved its deleveraging goals and is wellpositioned for capitalizing on future acquisition opportunities

during 2003 the company made 260 million in payments on borrowings in the second quarter 2003 the company repurchased 39 million shares of common stock and agreed to settle the remainder of its equity hedge through the repurchase of 41 million shares over the next four years the 39 million share repurchase was made with 100 million of cash and increased commercial paper borrowings while the 41 million share repurchase involved 113 million of term debt no open market purchase 

of shares occurred these repurchases of shares under the equity hedge contract repayment of debt and currency fluctuation resulted in a 20 million decrease in the companys shortterm and longterm borrowings

in 2002 the company received 338 million in net proceeds from issuance of longterm debt and disbursed 356 million for business acquisitions the company made 154 million in payments on borrowings

in 2004 the company took advantage of favorable market conditions by refinancing its 364 day and long term multiyear credit arrangements creating a long term credit facility with several us banks to borrow up to 400 million at the lower of prime or money market rates this long term credit facility matures in october 2009 in addition the company has shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 161 million of which 120 million was available at january 1 2005 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal of the 561 million aggregate credit lines 400 million is available to support the companys commercial paper program in addition to these lines of credit the company maintains a facility designed for the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity as of january 1 2005 the companys maximum available funds under this arrangement were 122 million of which 12 million was utilized

in 2003 the company filed a shelf registration in the amount of 900 million this filing represents a prospectus which if accompanied by a prospectus supplement would allow the company to offer issue and sell together or separately debt equity and other securities

the company also has numerous assets predominantly vehicles and equipment under a oneyear term renewable us master personal property lease residual value obligations which approximate the fair value of the related assets under this master lease were 24 million at january 1 2005 the company does not anticipate any material liabilities associated with these transactions

contractual obligations the following summarizes the companys significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity

 

other commercial commitments 

 

shortterm borrowings longterm debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within note i long term debt and financing arrangements and operating leases and other commercial commitments are explained in detail in note r commitments and guarantees of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15

the company believes that its dividend is an important factor in generating returns for the shareowners the companys long term policy is to increase dividends by up to onehalf of the companys earnings growth rate ultimately reaching a payout ratio of 25 of net earnings dividend increases are determined periodically in light of this policy and other considerations dividends increased 49 in 2004 40 in 2003 and 53 in 2002 the company plans to use a significant portion of free cash flow after dividends operating cash flow less dividends and capital expenditures to fund future acquisitions in commercial and industrial markets

market risk

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the companys predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies including the chinese rmb certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection primarily purchased options the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into several crosscurrency interest rate swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2004 would have been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all currencies the company generally does not hedge commodity price exposures

the companys exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps and crosscurrency swaps the companys primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at january 1 2005 the result of a hypothetical two percentage point increase in shortterm libor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the pretax profit of the company

fluctuations in the fair value of the companys common stock affect esop expense as discussed in the us pension and esop section of management discussion and analysis

sales to the home depot amounted to 12 of 2004 consolidated net sales from continuing operations the company has other significant customers particularly home centers and major retailers though individually there are no others that exceed 10 of consolidated sales the loss or material reduction of business from any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no material instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating and no significantly restrictive covenants the company believes that its 

strong financial position operating cash flows and borrowing capacity provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy

new accounting standards

refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the companys consolidated results of operations and financial position

critical accounting estimates

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies in item 15 management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from managements estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts  stanleys estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first the company evaluates specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations such as bankruptcy in these cases the company uses its judgment based on the best available facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience if circumstances change for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced

inventories – lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete  us inventories are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the book value of discontinued product lines and stockkeepingunits skus to determine that these items are properly valued the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required the company identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value then cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost then the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets  the company completed acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 valued at 322 million and 23 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method at their fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company had recorded goodwill of 640 million and 79 million of indefinitelived tradenames at january 1 2005

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangibles impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available at the date of assessment which primarily incorporate management assumptions about future cash flows future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities while the company has not recorded intangibles impairment losses in several years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event expected cash flows change significantly specifically the specialty tools and fastening systems reporting units had experienced operating profit and margin rate declines in 2003 and 2002 due to the depressed technology industry and intensified competition respectively in 2004 however both fastening systems and specialty tools operating profits and margin rates increased due to improved market conditions and strong execution by management specialty tools and fastening systems had 73 million and 41 million respectively of recorded goodwill at january 1 2005 there is potential for future goodwill and intangible impairment losses if projected profits and cash flows significantly decline from current estimates see note g goodwill customer relationships and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 for further discussion

property plant and equipment ppe  the company generally values ppe at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company has recorded impairment losses related to unused assets and additional such losses may occur in the future

risk insurance  to some extent the company self insures for various business exposures for domestic workers compensation and product liability the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses stop loss insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers compensation and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the companys products actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form the basis for workers compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary contemplates the companys specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserve required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists insurance companies for workers compensation and by inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for product liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected future claim payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of january 1 2005 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate

income taxes  the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is 56 million at january 1 2005 and 84 million at january 3 2004 the company believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of january 1 2005 amounted to 37 million

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss 

carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made by contrast if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable earnings adjustment in the period in which that determination is made

the company periodically assess its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still under audit based on the most current available information when it is deemed probable that an adjustment will be asserted the company accrues its best estimate of the tax liability inclusive of related interest charges see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements

the companys offbalance sheet arrangements include the following

receivable securitizations  the company has agreements to sell on a revolving basis pools of accounts and notes receivables to a qualified special purpose entity qspe which qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary the entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable assets and related debt offbalance sheet were both 12 million at january 1 2005 the company is responsible for servicing these accounts while the qspe bears the risk of noncollection there were no sales of eligible receivables in 2004 as the securitization was reduced by 42 million during the year

in 2003 the company acquired a third partys interest in a special purpose entity spe which supported the mac tools extended financing programs as a result the entity became nonqualifying and the net assets which consisted primarily of notes receivable of 564 million at january 3 2004 were consolidated in the companys balance sheet no gains or losses related to sales to the spe were recorded during 2003 the company sold 39 million of receivables in this portfolio to a third party in 2004 the majority of the remaining portfolio was sold without recourse for 50 million and the spe was dissolved the company has outsourced both of the mac tools extended financing programs to third parties and has thus reduced its exposure to future credit losses

synthetic leases  the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are offbalance sheet these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility as of january 1 2005 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these two properties were 50 million and 42 million respectively

1c narrative description of business

the companys operations are classified into two business segments tools and doors

tools

the tools segment manufactures and markets carpenters mechanics pneumatic and hydraulic tools as well as tool sets these products are sold to customers and distributed directly to retailers including home centers mass merchants hardware stores and retail lumber yards as well as through third party distributors

carpenters tools include hand tools such as measuring instruments planes hammers knives and blades screwdrivers saws chisels boring tools masonry tile and drywall tools as well as electronic stud sensors levels alignment tools and elevation measuring systems the company markets its carpenters tools under the stanley® fatmax® maxgrip tm  powerlock® intellitools tm  dynagrip® and goldblatt® brands

competition

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its wellknown brands its commitment to customer service and strong customer relationships the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product innovation

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware business who produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the companys the majority of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines within a particular line the company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line than any other toolmaker the company also believes that it is a leader in the manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners to the construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of handheld hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroads utilities and public works in the doors segment the company believes that it is a us leader in commercial hardware products mirrored closet doors and hardware for sliding folding and pocket doors and the us leader in the manufacture sale and installation of automatic sliding and swing powered doors

customers

a substantial portion of the companys products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us in 2003 approximately 16 of the companys consolidated sales from continuing operations in the tools and doors segments collectively were to one customer because a consolidation of retailers in the home center and mass merchant distribution channel is occurring these customers constitute a growing percent of the companys sales and are important to the companys operating results while this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of this one customer as well as certain of the other larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on each of the companys business segments until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has a diversified customer base and is seeking to broaden its customer base further in each business segment by identifying and seeking new channels and customers that it does not currently serve

raw materials

the companys products are manufactured of steel and other metals wood and plastic the raw materials required are available from a number of sources at competitive prices and the company has multiyear contracts with many of its key suppliers the company has experienced no difficulties in obtaining supplies in recent periods certain commodity prices particularly steel are expected to increase in 2004 but the company does not anticipate difficulties with respect to adequate supplies of raw materials

backlog

at march 6 2004 the company had approximately 287 million in unfilled orders compared with 168 million in unfilled orders at march 1 2003 all of these orders are reasonably expected to be 

filled within the current fiscal year most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result the company produces primarily for inventory rather than to fill specific orders

patents and trademarks

neither business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on either business segment the company owns numerous patents none of which are material to the companys operations as a whole these patents expire at various times over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the companys operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in duration from one to 20 years

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide the stanley® and stanley in a notched rectangle design trademarks are material to both business segments these wellknown trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are among the worlds most trusted brand names the companys tagline make something great is the centerpiece of the brand strategy for both segments in the tools segment the bostitch® powerlock® tape rule case design powerlock fatmax® labounty® mac® proto® jensen® goldblatt® husky® vidmar® and zag® trademarks are also material to the business in the doors segment the best® trademark is material to the business the terms of these trademarks vary from one to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms

environmental regulations

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the companys expenditures related to environmental matters

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially responsible party prp in a number of administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including ten active superfund sites

current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the following the solvency of the other prps whether responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the fact that its volumetric contribution if any at these sites is relatively small

the companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available as of january 3 2004 the company had reserves of approximately 115 million primarily for remediation activities associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites for losses that are probable and estimable

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

employees

at january 3 2004 the company had approximately 13500 employees nearly 6200 of whom were employed in the us approximately 1100 us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 14 different local labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions the majority of the companys hourlypaid and weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining agreements the companys labor agreements in the us expire in 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 with the exception of an eleven day strike in new britain and farmington connecticut there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the companys operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

the company has embarked on a growth strategy which will likely alter its portfolio of businesses in the future this growth strategy encompasses acquisitions and the reduction of risk associated with certain large customer concentrations the company believes this strategy will improve the overall profitability of operations in 2003 acquisitions primarily best access which was completed in november 2002 had a significant favorable impact on the company additionally the company entered into a definitive agreement during december 2003 to sell its residential entry door business and therefore this business has been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods the entry door business contributed 013 017 and 012 of diluted earnings per share in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively as discussed in note v subsequent events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of the form 10k in the first quarter of 2004 the sale of the entry door business the acquisition of chicago steel tape co and tender offers for blick plc and frisco bay industries ltd were completed the three acquisitions are expected to offset the financial impact associated with the sale of the entry door business

net sales from continuing operations were 2678 million for 2003 as compared to 2384 million in 2002 a 12 increase acquisitions contributed 266 million or an 11 increase of net sales organic sales volume declined primarily due to the termination of the macdirect program combined with industrial and consumer channel customers inventory corrections in the first half of 2003 these declines were partially offset by strong fourth quarter 2003 demand in the us hand tools and mechanics tools businesses and expanding service operations and share gains at national accounts in the access technologies business overall organic sales volume declined 2 offset by favorable foreign currency translation of 3 due primarily to the european currencies

net sales from continuing operations were 2384 million for 2002 which were relatively flat as compared to 2394 million in 2001 sales in 2002 increased 2 from acquisitions and 1 from the translation of foreign currencies which strengthened against the us dollar organic sales declined 3 principally due to the negative impact of the mechanics tools plant consolidation continued overall price erosion and ongoing weakness in industrial markets

in 2002 the company reported gross profit from continuing operations of 790 million or 331 of net sales compared to 861 million or 360 of net sales in 2001 the decline in 2002 gross profit is attributed to the following matters i the costs associated with the consolidation of two mechanics tools manufacturing plants related production inefficiencies and sales declines due to related plant supply chain problems ii consumer business price erosion due to the continued customer mix shift towards home centers and mass merchants iii fastening systems price erosion associated with intensified generic nail competition as well as a strategy shift to large distributors and away from smaller customers iv a reduction in lastin firstout lifo related inventory benefit in 2002 versus 2001 v increased inventory loss provisions vi and lower retirement plan income these issues were offset to some extent by favorable material and other productivity variances as well as acquisitions which contributed approximately 22 million to gross profit in 2002 included in gross profit for 2002 were 13 million of charges related to macdirect and fastening systems inventories gross profit in 2001 included 13 million of charges related to business repositioning initiatives within the tools segment and the disposition of inventories principally from discontinued manufacturing plants and skus

selling general and administrative expenses sga from continuing operations inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts were 638 million or 238 of net sales in 2003 compared to 526 million or 221 of net sales in the prior year the increase relates to 70 million of incremental expenses from acquisitions 25 million of receivable losses associated with the macdirect exit 8 million of costs related to the retirement of the companys ceo higher retirement plan costs and the negative impact from foreign currency translation

sga expenses from continuing operations were 526 million or 221 of net sales in 2002 compared to 553 million or 231 of net sales in 2001 the company reduced spending in many functions particularly selling expenses in mac tools as a result of lower retail distributor headcount there was a 12 million decline in the provision for doubtful accounts mainly attributable to a decrease in mac tools provisions due to lower sales as compared with 2001 and the mix shift from retail to wholesale sales which involve reduced credit risk these favorable items more than offset a decrease in retirement plan income in 2002 included in sga for 2002 is 10 million in charges from severance and related expenses 8 million and mac tools receivable losses 2 million sga expenses in 2001 included 8 million in charges from business repositioning and additional severance charges apart from the restructuring initiatives

net interest expense from continuing operations for 2003 was 28 million an increase of 4 million from 24 million in 2002 this increase was from higher borrowings primarily for acquisitions partially offset by lower interest rates net interest expense from continuing operations for 2002 was 24 million down slightly from 26 million in 2001 the decrease was a result of lower interest rates and weighted average debt levels in 2002

othernet from continuing operations was 40 million in expense for 2003 compared to 9 million in income for 2002 the increase is primarily the result of an 18 million gain in 2002 from the us pension settlement 12 million of higher losses in 2003 related to the companys macadvantage 

financing program a 6 million loss on the sale of the mac tools distributor receivable portfolio in 2003 increased intangible amortization expense of 10 million in 2003 associated with acquisitions and 11 million in income from an environmental settlement with an insurance carrier in 2002 which was offset by a 2 million increase in other environmental expense

othernet from continuing operations was 9 million in income for 2002 and 2001 however there were some significant charges and credits that were recorded in each year the 2002 amount includes an 18 million gain from the us pension settlement 8 million in fixed asset impairment losses and 11 million in income from an environmental settlement with an insurance carrier which was offset by a 2 million increase in other environmental expense the 2001 amount includes a 29 million us pension plan curtailment gain and a charge of 2 million related to mac tools business repositionings there was no goodwill amortization expense in 2002 due to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets while goodwill amortization was 8 million in 2001

the companys effective income tax rate from continuing operations for 2003 was 27 as compared to 32 for 2002 and 33 for 2001 the tax rate decreases reflect the continued benefit of a higher percentage of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates primarily in europe israel and the far east the 2003 effective income tax rate was affected further by the tax benefit from the operation 15 charges which were predominately us based the 2003 and 2002 income taxes reflect favorable foreign tax developments that reduced income taxes by 2 million and 6 million respectively the 2002 favorable development was offset by the impact of nondeductible excise tax associated with the termination of the defined benefit pension plan in addition the company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit in 2001 amounting to 3 million

tools

 

tools sales in 2003 increased 1 as compared to 2002 the sales volume increased slightly as a result of strong fourth quarter 2003 demand in the us hand tools and mechanics tools businesses and favorable foreign currency translation due primarily to the european currencies offset partially by declining sales from the termination of the macdirect program and industrial and consumer channel customers inventory corrections in the first half of 2003 tools operating profit was impacted by the charges previously mentioned totaling 55 million in 2003 and 28 million in 2002 the remaining 19 million decrease in operating profit is primarily due to higher retirement plan costs shift in business mix and additional price erosion in 2003

tools sales declined 27 in 2002 as compared to 2001 the sales decrease was mainly the result of price erosion and unfavorable channel mix in several businesses and the mechanics tools plant consolidation previously mentioned offset by 23 million in higher sales from acquisitions tools operating profit was impacted by the charges previously mentioned totaling 28 million in 2002 and 15 million in 2001 the remaining 45 million decline in operating profit was primarily attributable to the previously detailed mechanics tools domestic plant consolidation and internal product sourcing matters price concessions in the consumer and fastening systems businesses lower lastin firstout lifo related inventory valuation change in 2002 as compared with 2001 and increased inventory loss provisions cost structure improvements including shifting production to low cost countries and sga cost reductions were more than offset by the above items

in june 2002 and september 2001 8 million and 5 million in severance charges were recorded respectively as the company continued to rationalize its headcount to provide further sga expense reductions these charges were classified within sga expense in the consolidated statements of operations these actions resulted in the termination of approximately 200 selling and administrative employees in each year as of december 28 2002 no accrual remained as all of the severance has been expended

in 2001 the company undertook initiatives to reduce its cost structure and executed several business repositionings intended to improve its competitiveness these actions resulted in the closure of 13 facilities and a net employment reduction of approximately 2200 production selling and administrative people as a result the company recorded 72 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges the charges for asset impairments were primarily related to manufacturing and other assets that were retired and disposed of as a result of manufacturing facility closures

financial condition

liquidity sources and uses of capital

the companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under various credit facilities the company has historically generated strong cash flows from operations in 2003 cash flow from operations was 464 million as compared to 285 million in 2002 the increase is the result of working capital improvements from receivables of 22 million and inventories of 24 million cash proceeds of approximately 40 million from the sale of the mac tools distributor receivable portfolio income tax payment deferrals and refunds aggregating 57 million and 17 million in lower cash payments related to restructuring and other charges in 2003 versus 2002

in 2002 cash flows from operations were 285 million as compared to 222 million in 2001 in 2002 the company received a gross pension settlement of 115 million an ongoing us defined contribution plan was prefunded with 29 million and excise and income taxes totaling 48 million were paid providing a net 38 million cash inflow from the pension settlement additionally the company renegotiated its payment practices with a major customer enabling acceleration of accounts receivable collections by approximately 30 million cash payments related to restructuring and other charges of 42 million in 2002 were comparable to 2001

capital expenditures were 52 million in 2002 as compared to 73 million in 2001 the company incurred higher capital expenditures in 2001 for the stanley learning center a major addition at world headquarters for the training and development of employees investment in various plants including movement of production to low cost countries and increased costs for software development and acquisitions as the company expanded the infrastructure of its systems

during 2003 the company made 260 million in payments on borrowings in the second quarter of 2003 the company repurchased 39 million shares of common stock and agreed to settle the remainder of its equity hedge through the repurchase of 41 million shares over the next four years the 39 million share repurchase was made with 100 million of cash and increased commercial paper borrowings while the 41 million share repurchase involved 113 million of term debt these 

repurchases of shares under the equity hedge contract repayment of debt and currency fluctuation resulted in a 20 million decrease in the companys shortterm and longterm borrowings

in 2002 the company received 338 million in net proceeds from issuance of longterm debt and disbursed 356 million for business acquisitions the company made 154 million in payments on borrowings these debt proceeds and repayments in addition to debt issuance costs and currency fluctuations resulted in a 220 million increase in the companys shortterm and longterm borrowings

the company has unused short 364 day and longterm multiyear credit arrangements with several banks to borrow up to 350 million at the lower of prime or money market rates of this amount 100 million is longterm in addition the company has shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 67 million of which the entire amount was available at january 3 2004 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal of the longterm and shortterm lines 350 million is available to support the companys commercial paper program in addition to these lines of credit the company maintains a facility designed for the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity as of january 3 2004 the companys maximum available funds under this arrangement were 87 million of which the company had utilized 54 million

the company also has numerous assets predominantly vehicles and equipment under a oneyear term renewable us master personal property lease residual value obligations which approximate the fair value of the related assets under this master lease were 35 million at january 3 2004 the company does not anticipate any material liabilities associated with these transactions

the following summarizes the companys significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity

contractual obligations

 

included in the table above are 3 million of unconditional purchase commitments for the entry door business that were assumed by the buyer upon the sale of this discontinued operation in march 2004 other longterm obligations primarily relate to deferred compensation commitments to executives

other commercial commitments

 

shortterm borrowings longterm debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within note i long term debt and financing arrangements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k operating leases and other commercial commitments are explained in detail in note r commitments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k

the company believes that its dividend is an important factor in generating returns for its shareowners the companys stated long term policy is to increase dividends by approximately onehalf the companys earnings growth rate ultimately reaching a dividend payout ratio of 25 dividend increases are considered periodically in light of this policy and other considerations dividends increased 40 in 2003 53 in 2002 and 44 in 2001 the company plans to use a significant portion of free cash flow operating cash flow less dividends and capital expenditures to fund future acquisitions in commercial and industrial markets

market risk

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies the companys predominant exposures are in european canadian and asian currencies certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities are consolidated prior to obtaining risk protection primarily purchased options the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables predominately affiliate transactions gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into several crosscurrency interest rate swaps to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2003 would have been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all currencies

the companys exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps caps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps the companys primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at january 3 2004 the result of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in shortterm libor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the pretax profit of the company

fluctuations in the fair value of the companys common stock affect esop expense as well as diluted shares outstanding as discussed in the us pension and esop section of management discussion and analysis

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world there are no material instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating and no significantly restrictive covenants the company believes that its strong financial position operating cash flows and borrowing capacity provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy

other matters

environmental

the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws 

and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the companys expenditures related to routine environmental matters

the company accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines which address probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs the liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company believes that any sum it may pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded will not have a materially adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity refer to note t contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further information on environmental liabilities and related cash flows

us pension and esop

in june 2002 the company recorded an 18 million pretax pension settlement gain in othernet this involved the termination and settlement of the primary us salaried employee plan as well as settlement of most of the liabilities in the ongoing plan for hourly employees in addition to the settlement gain the company recorded 8 million of operating income related to these plans in 2002 whereas in 2003 the ongoing hourly plan resulted in 2 million of expense

as detailed in note m employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k the company has an employee stock ownership plan esop under which the ongoing us defined contribution and 401k plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released in 2003 the market value of shares released averaged 2930 per share and the net esop expense was 9 million in 2002 the market value of shares released averaged 3962 per share and the net esop expense was negligible

the company provides a 5 guaranteed rate of return on participant contributions made to the tax deferred savings plan 401k prior to july 1998 when all contributions were invested in stanley common stock the value of the shares participants purchased prior to july 1998 along with the 5 cumulative guaranteed rate of return on stanley common stock is known as an investment protection account ipa beginning in july 1998 the investment options for plan participant contributions were enhanced to include a variety of investment funds in addition to the companys common stock and there is no guaranteed rate of return to participants on any contributions made after that time the ipa guarantee is included in the actuarial valuation of the ongoing us pension plan payments related to the ipa guarantees if they have any value would be made to participants over a period of many years generally as they retire in the event the market value of stanley common stock declines additional costs may be triggered by the ipa benefit guarantee

new accounting standards

refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the companys consolidated results of operations and financial position

critical accounting estimates

preparation of the companys financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below actual results in these areas could differ from managements estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts

stanleys estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved first the company evaluates specific accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations such as bankruptcy in these cases the company uses its judgment based on the best available facts and circumstances to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received second a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff experience

if circumstances change for example the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced

inventories — lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete

us inventories are generally valued at the lower of lifo cost or market the calculation of lifo reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the book value of discontinued product lines and skus to determine that these items are properly valued the company identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is less than market value then cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost then the company writes down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to complete and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete andor slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as obsolete andor slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to be adjusted accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets

the company completed acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 valued at 23 million and 359 million respectively the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method at their fair values at the date of acquisition goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses the company had recorded goodwill of 433 million at january 3 2004

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized intangibles impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available at the date of assessment which primarily incorporate management assumptions about future cash flows future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities while the company has not recorded intangibles impairment losses in several years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event expected cash flows change significantly specifically the specialty tools and fastening systems reporting units have been experiencing operating margin declines due to the depressed technology industry and intensified competition respectively in recent quarters however fastening systems operating margins have begun to improve specialty tools and fastening systems had 73 million and 38 million respectively of recorded goodwill at january 3 2004 there is potential for future goodwill impairment losses if specialty tools and fastening systems projected 

profits and cash flows significantly decline from current levels see note g goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further discussion

property plant and equipment ppe

the company generally values ppe at historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount the impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets ie sale leasing etc primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment are not currently used in operations the company has recorded impairment losses related to unused assets and additional such losses may potentially occur in the future

risk insurance

to some extent the company self insures for various business exposures for domestic workers compensation and product liability the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for catastrophic losses stop loss insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers compensation and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the companys products actuarial valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form the basis for workers compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary contemplates the companys specific loss history actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors to determine the range of estimated reserve required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party administrator specialists insurance companies for workers compensation and by inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for product liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected claim payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of january 3 2004 is adequate but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate

income taxes

the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is 84 million at january 3 2004 and 108 million at december 28 2002 management believes earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided the valuation allowance as of january 3 2004 amounted to 21 million

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made conversely if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made see note q income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements

the companys offbalance sheet arrangements include the following

receivable securitizations

the company has agreements to sell on a revolving basis pools of accounts and notes receivables to a qualified special purpose entity qspe which qualifies to be accounted for as an unconsolidated subsidiary the entity is designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable assets and related debt offbalance sheet were both 54 million at january 3 2004 the company is responsible for servicing these accounts while the qspe bears the risk of noncollection the proceeds from sales of eligible receivables to the qspe were 21 million in 2003 there were no gains or losses on these sales

in 2003 the company acquired a third partys interest in a special purpose entity spe which supports the mac tools extended financing programs as a result the entity became nonqualifying and the net assets which consist primarily of notes receivable of 564 million at january 3 2004 have been consolidated in the companys balance sheet no gains or losses related to sales to the company were recorded during 2003 the company sold approximately 40 million of receivables of this portfolio to a third party

synthetic leases

the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major distribution centers the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes where only the monthly lease amount is recorded in the income statement and the liability and value of underlying assets are offbalance sheet the reasons for these programs are primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility as of january 3 2004 the estimated fair values of assets and remaining obligations for these two properties were 37 million and 28 million respectively

marketed under the stanleyr magicdoorr welcomewatchr
stanleyacmetracktm monarchtm acmer wanderguardr  stanvision tm and
bestr brands and are sold directly to end users and retailers as well as
through third party distributors

competition

the company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality its
wellknown brands its commitment to customer service and strong customer
relationships the breadth of its product lines and its emphasis on product
innovation

the company encounters active competition in all of its businesses from both
larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and
services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses the
company has a large number of competitors however aside from a small number of
competitors in the consumer hand tool and consumer hardware business who
produce a range of products somewhat comparable to the companys the majority
of its competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products
or product lines within a particular line the company believes that it is one
of the largest manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line
than any other toolmaker the company also believes that it is a leader in the
manufacture and sale of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners to the
construction furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer
of handheld hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroads utilities
and public works in the doors segment the company believes that it is a us
leader in the manufacture and sale of insulated steel residential entrance doors
to the retail market commercial hardware products mirrored closet doors and
hardware for sliding folding and pocket doors and the us leader in the
manufacture sale and installation of automatic sliding and swing powered doors

customers

a substantial portion of the companys products are sold through home centers
and mass merchant distribution channels in the us in 2002 approximately 21
of the companys consolidated sales in the tools and doors segments collectively
were to one customer because a consolidation of retailers in the home center
and mass merchant distribution channel is occurring these customers constitute
a growing percent of the companys sales and are important to the companys
operating results while this consolidation and the domestic and international
expansion of these large retailers provide the company with opportunities for
growth the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a
certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the loss of this one
customer as well as certain of the other larger home centers as customers would
have a material adverse effect on each of the companys business segments until
either such customers are replaced or the company makes the necessary
adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has a diversified
customer base and is seeking to broaden its customer base further in each
business segment by identifying and seeking new channels and customers that it
does not currently serve

raw materials

the companys products are manufactured of steel and other metals wood and
plastic the raw materials required are available from a number of sources at
competitive prices and the company has multiyear contracts with many of its key
suppliers the company has experienced no difficulties in obtaining supplies in
recent periods

                                       3

backlog

at december 28 2002 the company had 134 million in unfilled orders compared
with approximately 168 million in unfilled orders at march 1 2003 all of
these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal
year most customers place orders for immediate shipment and as a result the
company produces primarily for inventory rather than to fill specific orders

patents and trademarks

neither business segment is dependent to any significant degree on patents
licenses franchises or concessions and the loss of these patents licenses
franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on either
business segment the company owns numerous patents none of which are material
to the companys operations as a whole these patents expire from time to time
over the next 20 years the company holds licenses franchises and concessions
none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the companys
operations as a whole these licenses franchises and concessions vary in
duration from one to 20 years

the company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide
the stanleyr and stanley in a notched rectangle design trademarks are material
to both business segments these wellknown trademarks enjoy a reputation for
quality and value and are among the worlds most trusted brand names the
companys tagline make something greattm is the centerpiece of the
companys brand strategy for both segments in the tools segment the
bostitchr powerlockr tape rule case design powerlock labountyr
macr protor jensenr goldblattr huskyr vidmarr and zagr
trademarks are also material to the business in the doors segment bestr
is also material to the business the terms of these trademarks vary from
one to 20 years with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like
terms

environmental regulations

the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the us
and foreign countries where it has operations future laws and regulations are
expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the companys
expenditures related to environmental matters

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state
regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the
company along with many other companies has been named as a potentially
responsible party prp in a number of administrative proceedings for the
remediation of various waste sites including ten active superfund sites
current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each prp in
assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has considered the
following the solvency of the other prps whether responsibility is being
disputed the terms of existing agreements experience at similar sites and the
fact that its volumetric contribution at these sites is relatively small

the companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation
costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of
liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with
respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing
technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into
account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as
assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded
are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
information that becomes available as of december 28 2002 the company had
reserves of approximately 167 million primarily for remediation activities
associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites that are
probable and estimable

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be
incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent


                                       4
page

uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision
in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any
sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position results of operations or liquidity

employees

at december 28 2002 the company had approximately 14900 employees nearly
8000 of whom were employed in the us approximately 10 of us employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 13 different local
labor unions who are in turn affiliated with approximately 6 different
international labor unions the majority of the companys hourlypaid and
weeklypaid employees outside the us are not covered by collective bargaining
agreements the companys labor agreements in the us expire in 2003 2004 and
2005 there have been no significant interruptions or curtailments of the
companys operations in recent years due to labor disputes the company believes
that its relationship with its employees is good

item 3 legal proceedings

in june 2002 stanley canada inc received a letter from the quebec ministry of
the environment indicating that groundwater contaminated with trichloroethene
and its breakdown products had been detected at or near the former company
facility in roxton pond quebec the ministry claimed that the companys former
operations were the source of the contamination and is seeking further
investigation and the sharing of certain costs the company has been working
cooperatively with the ministry to negotiate a settlement

on october 25 2002 stanley mechanics tools inc the stanley works
stanleyproto industrial tools inc and certain other parties were served with
a complaint in the circuit court of the state of oregon for the county of
clackamas by the city of milwaukie oregon alleging that volatile organic
compounds from the former company site in milwaukie have contaminated certain
city water supplies the city is seeking damages of approximately 484 million
the company believes that its liability at the site is limited because it
operated at the site for a short time it has thorough documentation
demonstrating that it never used the compounds in question and there are several
other potentially responsible parties in the area

the company does not expect that the resolution of these matters will have a
materially adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position
results of operations or liquidity

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

results of operations

net sales were 2593 million for 2002 as compared to 2607 million in 2001 a
1 decrease sales in 2002 increased 2 from acquisitions and 1 from the
translation of foreign currencies which strengthened against the us dollar
organic sales declined 4 principally due to the negative impact of the
mechanics tools plant consolidation continued overall price erosion and
ongoing weakness in industrial markets

net sales in 2001 of 2607 million were down 5 as compared to 2000 the
company experienced sales volume declines in the tools segment due to softness
in the commercial and industrial markets sales in 2001 were also negatively
impacted by approximately 1 from the translation of foreign currencies which
weakened against the us dollar

during 2002 the company reported a second quarter us pension settlement
pretax gain of 18 million also in the second quarter the company incurred 8
million in severance and related expenses associated with selling general and
administrative sga cost reductions in the third quarter the company
reported a 6 million income tax credit related to a favorable foreign tax
development in the fourth quarter the company recorded 22 million in noncash
charges for increased inventory and receivable loss provisions and for specific
manufacturing equipment impairments related to the following 1 a reassessment
of mac tools inventory and accounts receivable valuations as a result of a new
retail control system 2 an inventory valuation adjustment in fastening
systems associated with recent cost estimation process improvements and 3
impairment of certain fixed assets related primarily to the wichita falls and
dallas texas plants consolidation other significant credits in 2002 include
11 million in environmental income arising from a settlement with an insurance
carrier recognized in the third and fourth quarters these credits and charges
were classified within the 2002 consolidated statement of operations as follows
i cost of sales  13 million charge ii sga expenses  10 million
charge iii othernet  22 million credit and iv income taxes  6
million credit the tax benefit of these charges and credits was 12 million

the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 28
2002 include 56 million or 004 per share of accounting corrections these
corrections relate primarily to expense


                                       9
page

capitalization and depreciation which arose in prior fiscal years and account
for the difference between earnings set forth in these financial statements and
unaudited amounts included in the companys january 24 2003 earnings release
these costs were classified within the 2002 consolidated statement of operations
as follows i sales  05 million ii cost of sales 44 million and
iii othernet  07 million management believes that these corrections are
immaterial to any previously reported results of prior periods but has recorded
them in the aggregate in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 28 2002

during 2001 the company recorded charges related to restructuring initiatives
totaling 72 million 18 incurred in the first quarter and 54 incurred in the
fourth quarter these costs consisted primarily of severance and asset
impairments as the company continued to rationalize its cost structure and
reduce employment in addition the company incurred certain other significant
credits and charges during 2001 in the first quarter the company recorded a
pretax 29 million pension curtailment gain pertaining to its us pension
plan also in the first quarter the company recorded 11 million of charges
related to several business repositionings the repositionings were principally
in the tools segment and related to the continuing movement of production
permanent reduction of the overhead cost structure of its manufacturing system
and a series of initiatives at mac tools in the third quarter the company
recorded a charge of 5 million for severance costs incurred due to lower sales
volumes and the continuing weakness in the industrial markets also in the third
quarter the company recorded 3 million in special credits for tax benefits in
the fourth quarter the company recorded a charge of 6 million for the
disposition of inventories associated principally with discontinued
manufacturing plants and stockkeepingunits skus these credits and charges
were classified as period income and expenses and were specifically classified
within the consolidated statement of operations as follows i sales  1
million charge ii cost of sales  12 million charge iii sga expenses 
8 million charge iv interestnet  02 million credit v othernet 
28 million credit and vi income taxes  3 million credit the tax benefit
of the restructuring charges and these other charges and credits amounted to 18
million

since significant credits and charges obscure underlying trends the narrative
regarding results of operations and business segments has been expanded to
provide information as to the effects of these items on each financial statement
category

in 2002 the company reported gross profit of 836 million or 322 of net
sales compared to 905 million or 347 of net sales in 2001 included in gross
profit for 2002 were 13 million of fourth quarter charges related to mac tools
retail and fastening systems inventory as discussed previously gross profit in
2001 included 13 million of charges taken in the first and fourth quarters
related to business repositioning initiatives within the tools segment and the
disposition of inventories principally from discontinued manufacturing plants
and skus gross profit before these costs amounted to 849 million or 327 of
net sales in 2002 and 918 million or 352 of net sales in 2001 the 69
million or 250 basis point decline in gross profit in 2002 is attributed to
the following issues primarily within the tools segment i the costs
associated with the consolidation of two mechanics tools manufacturing plants
related production inefficiencies and sales declines due to us plant supply
chain problems ii consumer business price erosion due to the continued
customer mix shift towards home centers and mass merchants iii fastening
systems price erosion associated with intensified generic nail competition as
well as a strategy shift to large distributors and away from smaller customers
iv a reduction in lastin firstout lifo related inventory benefit in 2002
versus 2001 v increased inventory loss provisions vi and lower us
pension income these issues were offset to some extent by favorable material
and other productivity variances acquisitions contributed approximately 22
million to gross profit in 2002 the company anticipates continued pricing
pressure in the foreseeable future due to continued supplydemand imbalances in
the market the company expects to recover a significant portion of the negative
impact to gross profit related to the mechanics tools plant consolidation in
2003

in 2001 the company reported gross profit of 905 million or 347 of net
sales compared to 997 million or 363 of net sales in 2000 excluding the
charges discussed previously 2001 gross profit was 918 million or 352 of
sales the reduction in gross profit was a result of a shift in sales mix to
retail and independent mac tools sales channels versus industrial and direct mac
tools sales channels partially offset by 80 million in productivity
improvements the company experienced a lifo reserve decline as the company
continued to reduce its cost of manufacturing and product costs by moving
operations to lowcost countries these lifo benefits were offset by increases
in transportation costs and other inventory valuation reserves

sga expenses were 547 million or 211 of net sales in 2002 this includes 10
million in charges from second quarter severance and related expenses 8
million and fourth quarter mac tools expenses 2 million discussed
previously sga expenses in 2001 totaled 576 million or 221 of net sales
which included 8 million in charges 3 million in the first quarter and 5
million in the third quarter from business repositionings and additional
severance charges apart from the restructuring initiatives excluding these
items sga expenses amounted to 537 million or 207 of net sales in 2002 as
compared to 568 million or 218 of net sales in 2001 the company reduced
spending in many functions particularly selling expenses in mac tools as a
result of lower retail distributor headcount there was a 12 million decline in
the provision for doubtful accounts mainly attributable to a decrease in mac
tools provisions due to lower sales as compared with 2001 and the mix shift from
retail to wholesale sales which involve reduced credit risk these favorable
items more than offset a decrease in net us pension income in 2002

sga expenses were 576 million or 221 of net sales in 2001 as compared with
638 million or 234 of net sales in 2000 excluding the charges previously
detailed sga expenses were 568 million or 218 of net sales in 2001
improvements in 2001 sga expenses were attributable to continued cost
reductions achieved from changes made within the information management
infrastructure downward adjustments to employment levels in response to weak
economic markets and the benefits attained from the companys restructuring and
repositioning efforts

interestnet for 2002 was 25 million down slightly from 26 million in 2001
the decrease was a result of lower interest rates and weighted average debt
levels in 2002 interestnet of 26 million in 2001 represented a small decrease
from 27 million in 2000 due to a decline in interest rates partially offset by
an increase in weighted average debt levels in 2001

othernet in 2002 was 8 million in income compared to 5 million of income in
2001 the 2002 amount includes an 18 million gain from the second quarter us
pension settlement and 8 million in fourth quarter fixed asset impairment
losses the third and fourth quarters of 2002 reflect 11 million in income from
an environmental settlement with an insurance carrier which was offset by a 2
million increase in other environmental expense the 2001 amount includes a 29
million us pension plan curtailment gain and a charge of 2 million related to
mac tools business repositionings both occurring in the first quarter of 2001
there was no goodwill amortization expense in 2002 due to adoption of statement
of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible
assets while goodwill amortization was 8 million in 2001 asset disposals
generated 1 million in gains in 2002 as compared to 1 million in losses in
2001 the company expects noncash intangibles amortization expense to increase
to approximately 10 million in 2003 based on preliminary acquisition purchase
accounting as compared with 4 million in 2002

othernet represented 5 million of income in 2001 compared with 20 million
expense in 2000 excluding the aforementioned pension curtailment gain of 29
million and charges of 2 million 2001 othernet amounted to 22 million
expense

the companys effective income tax rate for 2002 was 32 as compared to 33 for
2001 and 34 for 2000 the tax rate decreases reflect the continued benefit of
organizational and operational changes during recent years that have generated a
higher percentage of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates
primarily in europe israel and the far east the third quarter of 2002
reflects a favorable foreign tax development that reduced income taxes by 6
million which was offset by the impact of nondeductible excise tax associated
with the termination of the defined benefit pension plan

in addition the company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit in the third
quarter of 2001 amounting to 3 million these benefit items were entirely
offset by reduced tax benefits related to the restructuring and other charges

tools sales declined 27 in 2002 as compared to 2001 the sales decrease was
mainly the result of price erosion and unfavorable channel mix in several
businesses and the mechanics tools plant consolidation previously mentioned
offset by 23 million in higher sales from acquisitions tools operating profit
excluding the net impact of the charges allocated to the tools segment totaling
23 million in 2002 and 15 million in 2001 totaled 231 million or 118 of
net sales and 281 million or 140 of net sales respectively the 50 million
decline was primarily attributable to the previously detailed mechanics tools

including shifting production to low cost countries and sga cost reductions
were more than offset by the above items

tools sales decreased 6 in 2001 as compared to 2000 the sales decrease was
primarily the result of unit volume declines from the mac tools repositioning in
the first quarter of 2001 and weak industrial markets in north america also
contributing to the sales decline was the effect of foreign currency translation
as european currencies weakened against the us dollar despite lower sales
tools operating profit as a percentage of net sales remained fairly static as
compared to 2000 excluding the impact of 15 million in 2001 special charges
allocated to the tools segment operating profit was 281 million or 139 of
net sales the improvement in 2001 operating margin as a percentage of net sales
excluding special charges was primarily a result of sga expense reductions

sales were offset by declines in home decor operating profit was 127 of net

net sales for 2001 were fairly static representing a decrease of less than 1
strong sales attributable to a new program launch with a significant customer

excluding the impact of 5 million in charges allocated to the doors segment in
2001 operating profit was 69 million or 115 of sales the improvement in
operating profit as a percentage of sales is a result of increased
productivity in the hardware business as the company shifted the production base
to lowcost countries and the reduction of sga expenses

restructuring activities

in 2001 the company undertook initiatives to reduce its cost structure and
executed several business repositionings intended to improve its
competitiveness these actions resulted in the closure of 13 facilities and a
net employment reduction of approximately 2200 production selling and
administrative people as a result the company recorded 72 million of
restructuring and asset impairment charges reserves were established for these
initiatives consisting of 55 million for severance 10 million for asset
impairment charges and 7 million for other exit costs the charges for asset
impairments were primarily related to manufacturing and other assets that were
retired and disposed of as a result of manufacturing facility closures

at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 restructuring and asset impairment
reserve balances were 2 million and 39 million respectively the december 29
2001 balance reflects 6 million related to the impairment of assets the
december 28 2002 balance relates primarily to 2001 initiatives

as of december 28 2002 86 manufacturing and distribution facilities had been
closed as a result of the restructuring initiatives since 1997 in 2002 2001
and 2000 approximately 1000 2100 and 900 employees have been terminated as a
result of restructuring initiatives respectively severance payments of 26
million 42 million and 29 million and other exit payments of 4 million 4
million and 3 million were made in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively
writeoffs of impaired assets were 6 million 8 million and 7 million in
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

                                       13

in june 2002 and september 2001 8 million and 5 million in severance charges
were recorded respectively as the company continued to rationalize its
headcount to provide further sga expense reductions these charges were
classified within sga expense in the consolidated statements of operations
these actions resulted in the termination of approximately 200 selling and
administrative employees in each year as of december 28 2002 no accrual
remained the company expects to continue restructuring activities in the future
primarily in connection with the movement of manufacturing or sourcing to low
cost countries and sga expense reductions

in 2002 64 million in restructuring reserves were established in purchase
accounting for the best acquisition due to planned closure of several best
offices and synergies in certain centralized functions the 64 million is
comprised of 53 million for severance and 11 million for other exit costs
primarily related to noncancelable leases

financial condition

liquidity sources and uses of capital

the companys primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and
borrowings under various credit facilities the company has historically
generated strong cash flows from operations in 2002 cash flows from operations
were 285 million as compared to 222 million in 2001 in the second half of
2002 the company received a gross pension settlement of 115 million an
ongoing us defined contribution plan was prefunded with 29 million and
excise and income taxes totaling 48 million were paid providing a net 38
million cash inflow from the pension settlement in the fourth quarter one of
the companys major customers changed its payment practices enabling
acceleration of accounts receivable collections by approximately 30 million
excluding the 38 million pension settlement and the 30 million impact of a
change in a major customers payment practice 2002 operating cash flows were
217 million consistent with 2001 cash payments related to restructuring and
other charges of 42 million in 2002 were comparable to 2001

during 2001 the company generated 222 million in operating cash flow as
compared to 236 million in 2000 the decline in operating cash flows was
primarily the result of an increase in cash payments for restructuring in 2001
of 45 million as compared with 32 million in 2000

capital expenditures were 52 million in 2002 as compared to 73 million in
2001 the company incurred higher capital expenditures in 2001 for the stanley
learning center a major addition at world headquarters for the training and
development of employees investment in various plants including movement of
production to low cost countries and increased costs for software development
and acquisitions as the company expanded the infrastructure of its systems
capital expenditures were 73 million in 2001 as compared to 64 million in
2000

in 2002 the company received 338 million in net proceeds from issuance of
longterm debt and disbursed 356 million for business acquisitions the
company made 154 million in payments on borrowings these debt proceeds and
repayments in addition to debt issuance costs and currency fluctuations
resulted in a 220 million increase in the companys shortterm and longterm
borrowings

the company has unused short364 day and longterm multiyear credit
arrangements with several banks to borrow up to 350 million at the lower of
prime or money market rates of this amount 100 million is longterm in
addition the company has shortterm lines of credit with numerous foreign banks
aggregating 98 million of which 87 million was available at december 28
2002 shortterm arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal of the
longterm and shortterm lines 350 million is available to support the
companys commercial paper program in addition to these lines of credit the
company maintains a facility designed for the securitization of certain trade
accounts receivable for purposes of additional liquidity as of december 28
2002 the companys maximum available funds under this arrangement were 106
million of which the company had utilized 33 million

                                       14

the company also has numerous assets predominantly vehicles and equipment
under a oneyear term renewable us master personal property lease residual
value obligations which approximate the fair value of the related assets under
this master lease were 43 million at december 28 2002 the company does not
anticipate any material liabilities associated with these transactions

the companys objective is to increase dividends by approximately onehalf the
companys earnings growth rate ultimately reaching a dividend payout ratio of
25 dividends increased 53 in 2002 44 in 2001 and 35 in 2000 the
company plans to use a significant portion of free cash flow operating cash
flow less dividends and capital expenditures to fund future acquisitions in
commercial and industrial markets

the company repurchased 43 million shares of its common stock in 2000 the net
effect was a decrease in equity of 111 million these repurchases were funded
primarily by cash flow from operations the company may resume repurchase of its
shares as it deems appropriate

market risk

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes
in the fair value of financial instruments the company is exposed to market
risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates
exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company through its
global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in
multiple currencies the companys predominant exposures are in european
canadian and asian currencies certain crosscurrency trade flows arising from
sales and procurement activities are consolidated prior to obtaining risk


                                       15
page

protection primarily purchased options the company is thus able to capitalize
on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures
to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the company also enters
into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and
cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and
payables predominately intercompany transactions gains and losses from these
hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures
assets and liabilities being hedged management determines the nature and extent
of currency hedging activities and in certain cases may elect to allow certain
currency exposures to remain unhedged the company has also entered into several
crosscurrency interest rate swaps primarily to reduce overall borrowing costs
but also to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain
subsidiaries sensitivity to foreign currency exposure risk from these financial
instruments at the end of 2002 would have been immaterial based on the potential
loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in all currencies

the companys exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt
obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments
employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed
to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by
using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate
swaps caps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps the companys primary
exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us
canada and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at
december 28 2002 the result of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in
shortterm libor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the
pretax profit of the company

fluctuations in the fair value of the companys common stock affect esop expense
as well as diluted shares outstanding as discussed in the us pension and esop
and offbalance sheet arrangements equity hedge sections of management
discussion and analysis respectively

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around
the world there are no material instruments within the debt structure that
would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating and no
significantly restrictive covenants the company believes that its strong
financial position operating cash flows and borrowing capacity provide the
financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend
payments to invest in the routine needs of its businesses to make strategic
acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy

other matters

environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a
result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as
the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations
are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the companys
expenditures related to routine environmental matters

the company accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and
remediation efforts in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines which
address probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs the
liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or
remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated subject to the
imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company believes that
any sum it may pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will not have a materially adverse effect on its financial
position results of operations or liquidity refer to note t contingencies of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k

us pension and esop in june 2002 the company recorded an 18 million pretax
pension settlement gain in othernet this involved the termination and
settlement of the primary us salaried employee plan as well as settlement of
most of the liabilities in the ongoing plan for hourly employees in addition to
the settlement gain the company recorded 8 million of operating income related
to these plans in 2002 whereas in 2003 the ongoing hourly plan will reflect
approximately 2 million in expense

as detailed in note m employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial
statements in item 15 of this form 10k the company has an employee stock
ownership plan esop under which the ongoing us defined contribution and
401k plans are funded overall esop expense is affected by the market value of
stanley stock on the monthly dates when shares are released in 2002 the market
value of shares released averaged 3962 per share and the net esop expense was
negligible in the event the market value of stanley stock on the 2003 esop
share release dates is below the 3962 2002 average the net esop expense will
increase

the company provides a 5 guaranteed rate of return on participant contributions
made to the tax deferred savings plan 401k prior to july 1998 when all
contributions were invested in stanley common stock the value of the shares
participants purchased prior to july 1998 along with the 5 cumulative
guaranteed rate of return on stanley common stock is known as an investment
protection account ipa beginning in july 1998 the investment options for plan
participant contributions were enhanced to include a variety of investment funds
in addition to the companys common stock and there is no guaranteed rate of
return to participants on any contributions made after that time the ipa
guarantee for participants who are not considered highly compensated is now
included in the actuarial valuation of an ongoing us pension plan payments
related to the ipa guarantees if they have any value would be made to
participants over a period of many years generally commencing with retirement
in the event the market value of stanley common stock declines additional costs
may be triggered by the ipa benefit guarantee

new accounting standards

refer to note a significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements in item 15 of this form 10k for a discussion of new
accounting pronouncements and the potential impact to the companys consolidated
results of operations and financial position

critical accounting estimates preparation of the companys financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses significant accounting
policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
item 15 of this form 10k are described in note a significant accounting
policies thereto management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments
because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements result
primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with
inherent uncertainty the most significant areas involving management estimates
are described below actual results in these areas could differ from
managements estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts stanleys estimate for its allowance for
doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the
amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the
total amount reserved first the company evaluates specific accounts where
information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial
obligations such as bankruptcy in these cases the company uses its judgment
based on the best available facts and circumstances to record a specific
reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the
amount expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and
adjusted as additional information is received second a general reserve is
established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to
receivables aging categories these percentages are based on historical
collection and writeoff experience

if circumstances change for example higher than expected defaults or a material
adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its financial obligation to
the company estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be
reduced

in addition mac tools retail related receivables 43 million net at december
28 2002 are comprised of thousands of high credit risk individually small
accounts while some customers remit payments by mail to a large extent these
receivables are collected by distributors in direct contact with customers on
truck routes and by outside collection agencies on certain open routes and
delinquent accounts the company continues to reduce the number of mac tools
employee distributors who support the retail channel of the

page

business and increase the number of wholesale nonemployee distributors this
retail to wholesale mix shift in the mac tools business has an inherent positive
impact on the asset quality going forward but increases the collection risk of
these mac tools retail related receivables realization of these receivables is
dependent upon information systems and effective management of collection
efforts by distributors and outside agencies

inventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete us inventories
are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market the calculation of lifo
reserves and therefore the net inventory valuation is affected by inflation
and deflation in inventory components the company ensures all inventory is
valued at the lower of cost or market and continually reviews the book value of
discontinued product lines and skus to determine if these items are properly
valued the company identifies these inventories and assesses the ability to
dispose of them at a price greater than cost if it is determined that cost is
less than market value then cost is used for inventory valuation if market
value is less than cost then the company writes down the related inventory to
that value if a write down to the current market value is necessary the market
value cannot be greater than the net realizable value or ceiling defined as
selling price less costs to complete and dispose and cannot be lower than the
net realizable value less a normal profit margin also called the floor the
company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and
identifies slowmoving inventories inventory items identified as slowmoving
are evaluated to determine if reserves are required generally the company does
not experience significant issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of
its products if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding
net realizable value of inventory at its current value reserves would have to
be adjusted accordingly

goodwill and intangible assets the company completed acquisitions in 2002 valued
at 359 million the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded
under the purchase method at their fair values at the date of acquisition
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying
net assets of acquired businesses the company had recorded goodwill of 348
million at december 28 2002 and 216 million at december 29 2001

in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment
testing the identification and measurement of goodwill and unamortized
intangibles impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting
units the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best
information available at the date of assessment which primarily incorporate
management assumptions about future cash flows future cash flows can be
affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to
which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired
entities while the company has not recorded intangibles impairment losses in
several years it is possible impairments may occur in the future in the event
expected cash flows change significantly specifically the fastening systems
reporting unit is experiencing margin declines due primarily to the intensified
generic nail competition and industrial channel movement to large distributors
fastening systems had 33 million of recorded goodwill at december 28 2002
there is potential for future goodwill impairment losses if fastening systems
projected profits and cash flows continue to decline see note g goodwill and
other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in
item 15 of this form 10k for further discussion

property plant and equipment ppe the company generally values ppe at
historical cost less accumulated depreciation impairment losses are recorded
when indicators of impairment such as plant closures are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the carrying amount the company assesses whether machinery and equipment can be
used at other facilities and if not estimates the proceeds to be realized upon
sale of the assets the impairment loss is then quantified by comparing the
carrying amount of the assets to the weighted average discounted cash flows
which consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the assets
primarily as a result of plant rationalization certain facilities and equipment
are not currently used in operations the company has recorded impairment losses
related to unused assets and such losses may potentially occur in the future

the company initiated a worldwide ppe physical inventory in 2002 which is
expected to be complete in 2003 upon completion of this physical inventory it
is possible losses may be detected

risk insurance to some extent the company self insures for various business
exposures for domestic workers compensation and product liability the company
generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for catastrophic losses
stop loss insurance the two risk areas involving the most significant
accounting estimates are workers compensation and product liability liability
for alleged injuries associated with the companys products actuarial
valuations performed by an outside risk insurance expert form the basis for
workers compensation and product liability loss reserves recorded the actuary
contemplates the companys specific loss history actual claims reported and
industry trends among statistical and other factors to determine the range of
estimated reserve required risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific
reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development
of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims the
specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified by third party
administrator specialists insurance companies for workers compensation and by
inhouse legal counsel in consultation with outside attorneys for product
liability the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to
occur over approximately 8 to 10 years and the present value of expected claim
payments is reserved the company believes the liability recorded for such risk
insurance reserves as of december 28 2002 is adequate but due to judgments
inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ
from this estimate

freight accrual as a result of the continued movement of us based
manufacturing operations to low cost country manufacturing and outsourcing the
company has experienced increased transportation costs over the past three
years as well as increased complexity in the accrual estimation process for
these costs the companys accrual estimation methodology is based on data from

in the third quarter of 2003 based on an exposure draft issued by the financial
accounting standards board fasb currently activity on the equity hedge is
accounted for entirely within equity whereas under the proposed new rules mark
to market accounting will be required the rule change if enacted would mean

income statement in addition the proposed rule changes may require the company
to report the 213 million notional amount of the equity forward contracts as
debt the company is evaluating various alternatives including maintainance
modification and termination of its equity hedge program but has not decided on
any course of action

its major distribution centers the leases are designed and qualify as operating
leases for accounting purposes where only the monthly lease amount is recorded
in the income statement and the liability and value of underlying assets are

overall cost and to retain flexibility as of december 28 2002 the estimated
fair values of assets and remaining obligations for these two properties were
34 million and 24 million respectively fasb interpretation no fin 46
consolidation of variable interest entities will affect the accounting for one
of these synthetic leases in the third quarter of 2003 upon adoption of fin 46

and improve competitiveness vi to recover a significant portion of the
negative impact to gross profit of the mechanics tools plant consolidation and
vii to maintain the level of ongoing expense of the hourly pension plan are
forward looking and inherently subject to risk and uncertainty

the companys ability to generate cash increase shareowner returns and
dividends and maintain or increase sales and gain retail share is dependent on
both internal and external factors including i the success of the companys
efforts to redress production problems in its mechanics tools business ii the
success of the companys marketing and sales efforts iii the continued
success of initiatives with the home depot lowes and walmart iv continuing
improvements in productivity and cost reductions including inventory
reductions continued improvement in the payment terms under which the company
buys and sells goods materials and product and continued reduction of sga
expenses as a percentage of sales v the ability of the sales force to adapt
to changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer
coverage vi the absence of increased pricing pressures from customers and
competitors and the ability to defend market share in the face of price
competition vii the acceptance of the companys new products in the
marketplace as well as the ability to satisfy demand for these products viii
the successful integration of the companys recent acquisitions ix outcomes of
pending and future litigation and x the strength of the united states economy
and the relative strength of foreign currencies including without limitation
the euro and the taiwan dollar additionally the realization of mac tools
retail receivables in particular is dependent upon information systems and
effective management of collection efforts by distributors and outside agencies
pertaining to covered and open routes

the companys ability to improve its brand is dependent upon a number of
factors including the success of the marketing efforts of the company and its
customers and the success and acceptance of the companys new products

the companys ability to reduce its cost structure restructure and continue
productivity gains including the reduction of facilities and employees and
improve competitiveness is dependent on the success of various initiatives that
are underway or are being developed to improve manufacturing and sales
operations and to implement related control systems which initiatives include
certain facility closures and related workforce reductions expected to be
completed in 2003 the success of these initiatives is dependent on the
companys ability to increase the efficiency of its routine business processes
to develop and implement process control systems to mitigate the effects of any
material cost inflation to develop and execute comprehensive plans for facility
consolidations the availability of vendors to perform outsourced functions the
successful recruitment and training of new employees the resolution of any
labor issues related to closing facilities the need to respond to significant
changes in product demand while any facility consolidation is in process and
other unforeseen events

the companys ability to recover a significant portion of the negative impact to
gross profit related to flawed execution in mechanics tools consolidations is
dependent on the continued ability of the affected facilities to maintain
current production rates the successful integration and performance of new
mechanics tools operations and management personnel and processes and the
successful recovery of demand for mac and mechanics tools products affected by
the aforementioned flawed execution

the companys ability to maintain the level of ongoing expense of the hourly
pension plan is dependent on the companys employment levels and interest rates

the companys ability to achieve the objectives discussed above will also be
affected by other external factors these external factors include pricing
pressure and other changes within competitive markets the continued
consolidation of customers in consumer channels inventory management pressures
on the companys customers increasing competition changes in trade monetary
and fiscal policies and laws inflation currency exchange fluctuations the
impact of dollarforeign currency exchange rates on the competitiveness of

manufacturers of hand tools in the world featuring a broader line than any other
toolmaker the company also believes that it is a leader in the manufacture and
sale of pneumatic fastening tools and related fasteners to the construction
furniture and pallet industries as well as a leading manufacturer of handheld
hydraulic tools used for heavy construction railroads utilities and public

     customers a substantial portion of the companys products are sold through
home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the us in 2001
approximately 18 of the companys consolidated sales in the tools and doors
segments collectively were to one customer because a consolidation of retailers
in the home center and mass merchant distribution channel is occurring these
customers constitute a growing percent of the companys sales and are important
to the companys operating results while this consolidation and the domestic
and international expansion of these large retailers provide the company with
opportunities for growth the increasing size and importance of individual
customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential volume loss the
loss of this one customer as well as certain of the other larger home centers as
customers would have a material adverse effect on each of the companys business
segments until either such customers are replaced or the company makes the
necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business

despite the trend toward customer consolidation the company has a diversified
customer base and is seeking to broaden its customer base further in each
business segment by identifying and seeking new channels and customers that it
does not currently serve

     raw materials the companys products are manufactured of steel and other
metals wood and plastic the raw materials required are available from a number

specific orders

     patents and trademarks neither business segment is dependent to any
significant degree on patents licenses franchises or concessions and the loss
of these patents licenses franchises or concessions would not have a material
adverse effect on either business segment the company owns numerous patents
none of which are material to the companys operations as a whole these patents
expire from time to time over the next 20 years the company holds licenses
franchises and concessions none of which individually or in the aggregate is
material to the companys operations as a whole these licenses franchises and

     environmental regulations the company is subject to various environmental
laws and regulations in the us and foreign countries where it has operations
future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will
likely increase the companys expenditures related to environmental matters

the company is a party to a number of proceedings before federal and state
regulatory agencies relating to environmental remediation additionally the
company along with many other parties has been named as a potentially
responsible party prp in a number of administrative or judicial proceedings
for the remediation of various waste sites including ten 10 active superfund
sites current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each
prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company has
considered the following the solvency of the other prps whether
responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience
at similar sites and the fact that its volumetric contribution at these sites
is relatively small

the companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and


                                       5

remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of
liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with
respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing
technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not take into
account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as
assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded
are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
information that becomes available as of december 29 2001 the company had
reserves of approximately 146 million primarily for remediation activities
associated with companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be
incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures subject to the imprecision
in estimating future environmental costs the company does not expect that any
sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position results of operations or liquidity

           item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
           
and results of operations


results of operations


     results of operations net sales were 2624 million for 2001 as compared
to 2749 million in 2000 a 5 decrease the company experienced sales volume
declines in the tools segment due to softness in the commercial and industrial
markets sales in 2001 were also negatively impacted approximately 1 from the
translation of foreign currency as these currencies primarily in europe and
asia continue to weaken against the us dollar

net sales in 2000 of 2749 million were relatively flat as compared to 1999
overall unit volume growth was completely offset by a reduction from the net
effect of foreign currency translation primarily in europe the company
experienced sales volume growth in the tools segment which was partially offset
by the effects of weakening markets on the doors segment

during 2001 the company recorded charges related to restructuring initiatives
totaling 72 million 18 incurred in the first quarter and 54 incurred
in the fourth quarter these costs consisted primarily of severance and asset
impairments as the company continues to rationalize its cost structure and
headcount in addition the company incurred certain credits and charges during
2001 that were determined by management to be special or nonrecurring in the
first quarter the company recorded a pretax 29 million pension curtailment
gain pertaining to its us pension plan also in the first quarter the company
recorded 11 million of special charges related to several business
repositionings the repositionings were principally in the tools segment and
included continuing movement of production permanent reduction of the overhead
cost structure of its manufacturing system and a series of initiatives at mac
tools in the third quarter the company recorded a special charge of 5 million
for severance costs incurred due to lower sales volumes and the continuing
weakness in the industrial markets also in the third quarter the company
recorded 3 million in special credits for tax benefits in the fourth quarter
the company recorded a special charge of 6 million for the disposition of
inventories associated principally with discontinued manufacturing plants and
skus these special credits and charges were classified as period

                                       11

income and expenses and were specifically classified within the consolidated
statement of operations as follows i sales  1 million charge ii cost of
sales  12 million charge iii sga expenses  8 million charge iv
interestnet  02 million credit vi othernet  28 million credit and
vii income taxes  3 million credit the tax benefit of the restructuring
charges and the special charges and credits amounted to 18 million

financial results for the first six months of 1999 include transition expenses
related to the companys restructuring initiatives these costs were classified
as period operating expenses within cost of sales 20 million and sga
expenses 35 million they included the costs of moving production equipment
operating duplicate facilities while transferring production or distribution
consulting costs incurred in planning and implementing changes recruiting and
relocation of employees the cost of transition employees involved in
reorganizing the functions and other types of costs that were incurred to
facilitate restructuring in addition the company incurred costs to remediate
its computer and related systems so that these systems would function properly
with regard to date issues pertaining to the year 2000 y2k

results in 1999 also included a 20 million special charge in the fourth quarter
as the company recorded higher estimates for certain loss provisions related to
its mechanics tools businesses principally macdirect the changes in estimates
were based on the companys evolving experience in managing a direct mobile
sales force in the automotive channel as well as inefficiencies in operating
mechanisms and systems of the total 20 million special charges to income 3
million was included in net sales 11 million was included in cost of sales
11 million was included in sga expenses and a credit of 5 million was
included in othernet

because the presence of restructuring charges and asset impairments special
credits and charges restructuringrelated transition costs and nonrecurring
y2k remediation costs obscure the underlying trends within the companys
business the narrative regarding results of operations and business segments
has been expanded to provide information as to the effects of these items on
each financial statement category

in 2001 the company reported gross profit of 923 million or 352 of net
sales compared to 997 million or 363 of net sales in 2000 included in gross
profit for 2001 were 13 million of special charges taken in the first and
fourth quarters related to business repositioning initiatives within the tools
segment and the disposition of inventories principally with discontinued
manufacturing plants and skus

                                       12
page

gross profit excluding these costs amounted to 936 million or 356 of net
sales the reduction in gross profit was a result of a shift in sales mix to
retail and independent mac sales channels versus industrial and direct mac sales
channels partially offset by 80 million in productivity improvements the
company also experienced a decrease in cost of sales as a result of lastin
firstout lifo reserve decreases as the company continues to reduce its cost
of manufacturing and product costs by moving operations to lowcost countries
these lifo benefits were offset by increases in transportation costs and other
inventory valuation reserves

in 2000 the company reported gross profit of 997 million or 363 of net
sales compared to 341 in 1999 included in cost of sales for 1999 were 20
million of restructuringrelated transition costs primarily for plant
rationalization activities and a portion of the mechanic tools special charges
of 11 million gross profit in 1999 excluding these restructuringrelated and
special charges was 353 of net sales this significant improvement in gross
profit was attributable to a combination of the companys improved ability to
adjust employment and production plans as market demand fluctuated improved
cost controls in operations the benefits of the companys restructuring
programs and continued progress on purchased material costs despite
inflationary pressures

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 594 million for
2001 excluding the impact of 8 million in special charges 3 million in the
first quarter and 5 million in the third quarter from business repositionings
and additional severance charges apart from the restructuring initiatives sga
expenses amounted to 586 million or 223 of net sales as compared to 657
million for 2000 or 239 of net sales improvements in sga expenses are
attributable to continued cost reductions achieved from changes made within the
information management infrastructure downward adjustments to employment levels
in response to weak economic markets and the benefits attained from the
companys restructuring and repositioning efforts

sga expenses were 657 million or 239 of net sales in 2000 as compared
with 703 million or 255 of net sales in 1999 included in 1999 were 35
million of restructuringrelated transition and other nonrecurring costs and
fourth quarter special charges related to mechanics tools of 11 million
excluding these costs sga expenses were 657 million in 1999 or 239 of net
sales the company made significant strides in the latter half of 2000 in its
continual effort to reduce sga expenses in the first half of 2000 the
companys expenses were 6 higher than 1999 expenses for the same period
primarily the

                                       13
page

result of increased distribution costs information management infrastructure
costs and selling and administrative costs related to an increased number of
sales representatives in the macdirect program however in the second half of
2000 the companys expenses were 6 lower than 1999 expenses for the same
period significant cost reductions were achieved pertaining to information
management infrastructure distribution and administrative activities in 2000
sga expenses were also favorably impacted as compared to 1999 as a result of an
increase in income related to us pension plans

interestnet was 26 million in 2001 as compared to 27 million in 2000 the
decrease was a result of a decline in interest rates partially offset by an
increase in weighted average debt levels in 2001

interestnet of 27 million in 2000 represented a slight decrease from 28
million in 1999 as debt levels were relatively consistent from year to year

othernet for 2001 represents income of 5 million excluding the gain recorded
in conjunction with the companys curtailment of a us pension plan of 29
million and a special charge of 2 million both occurring in the first quarter
of 2001 othernet amounted to expense of 22 million as compared to expense of
20 million in 2000

othernet was 20 million of expense in 2000 compared with 3 million in income
for 1999 the company experienced lower gains from asset sales in 2000 and
incurred a writeoff of the remaining interest in a previously disposed
equipment rental business additionally included in 1999 results were
nonrecurring currency related gains of 11 million realized upon the
termination of a crosscurrency financial instrument

the companys effective income tax rate for 2001 was 33 as compared to 34 for
2000 and 35 for 1999 the tax rate decreases reflect the continued benefit of
organizational and operational changes during recent years that have generated a
higher percentage of taxable income in countries with lower statutory rates
primarily in europe israel and the far east

in addition the company recorded special credits in the third quarter of 2001
for tax benefits of 3 million these special credits were entirely offset by
reduced tax benefits related to the restructuring charges and special charges

tools sales declined in 2001 as compared to 2000 by 6 the sales decrease is
primarily the result of unit volume declines from the mac tools repositioning in
the first quarter of 2001 and weak industrial markets in north america also
contributing to the sales decline was the effect of foreign currency translation
as european currencies continued to decline against the us dollar despite lower
sales tools operating profit as a percentage of net sales remained fairly
static as compared to 2000 excluding the net impact of special credits and
charges allocated to the tools segment totaling 15 million operating profit
totaled 281 million or 139 of net sales the improvements in operating
margin exclusive of special credits and charges are primarily a result of sga
reductions

tools sales increased 1 in 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily from unit volume
improvements a 3 unit volume increase was almost completely offset by a 2
reduction in sales from the net effect of foreign currency translation
primarily due to weaker european currencies operating profit in 2000 for the
tools segment was 133 of net sales compared to 1999 excluding special
charges of 129 of net sales the increase from prior year is due to improved
cost controls in operations the benefits of the companys restructuring
initiatives and higher unit volumes

net sales in the doors segment reflect strong sales attributable to a new
program launch with a significant customer offset by certain sluggish market
conditions in the americas operating profit for doors totaled 106 of net
sales in 2001 as compared to 91 for 2000 excluding the impact of

net special credits and charges allocated to the doors segment totaling 5
million operating profit totaled 69 million or 114 of net sales the
improvements in operating profit as a percentage of sales is a result of
improved productivity in the hardware business as the company shifted the
production base to lowcost countries and the continued reduction of sga
expenses

net sales decreased by 5 in 2000 as compared to 1999 driven by declining
hardware sales this decline was partially offset by sales unit volume growth in
automated door products operating profit in 2000 was 91 of net sales compared
to operating profit of 66 for 1999 this increase is due primarily to
realization of benefits associated with various productivity programs

     restructuring activities in 2001 the company undertook new initiatives to
reduce its cost structure and executed several business repositionings intended
to improve its competitiveness these actions have or will result in the closure
of thirteen facilities and a net employment reduction of approximately 2100
production selling and administrative people as a result the company recorded
18 million and 54 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges in the
first and fourth quarters respectively reserves were established for these
initiatives consisting of 55 million for severance 10 million for asset
impairment charges and 7 million for other exit costs these initiatives are
expected to be substantially completed by the middle of 2003

in 1999 the company completed an evaluation of the remaining reserves that were
established in 1997 for restructuring initiatives and determined that certain
projects would be cancelled in order to reapply company resources to higher
payback areas accordingly in the fourth quarter of 1999 the company reversed
62 million of reserves established for such actions

also in 1999 new projects were approved to achieve improved cost productivity
these new initiatives included facility closures and the related relocation of
production a reduction in work force in administrative functions and the
outsourcing of noncore activities as well as related asset impairments the
company recorded restructuring and asset impairments charges related to these
new initiatives of 40 million of which 30 million related to severance 8
million related to asset impairment charges and 2 million related to other
exit costs

in 2000 the company completed the restructuring initiatives announced in 1997
and 1999 and will be incurring runoff expenditures of 2 million over the next
two years

to date the company has closed 66 facilities and reduced

financial condition


     liquidity sources and uses of capital the companys primary sources of
liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under various credit
facilities the company has historically generated strong cash flows from
operations in 2001 cash flows from operations were 222 million as compared to
236 million in 2000 the decline in operating cash flow was primarily the
result of an increase in cash payments for restructuring in 2001 of 45 million
as compared with 32 million in 2000 partially offset by an increase in
noncash earnings

during 2000 the company generated 236 million in operating cash flow versus
222 million in 1999 this increase resulted primarily from a significant
reduction in restructuringrelated transition costs which were offset partially
by higher working capital requirements in 2000 the companys receivables
decreased by 14 million inventory increased by 17 million and accounts
payable increased by 15 million the receivables decrease was primarily
attributed to the doors segment as volume declined the increased inventory was
in the tools segment the accounts payable increase resulted from renegotiation
of vendor terms and increased attention to payment management the company made
cash payments of 32 million for its restructuring activities primarily
severance

capital expenditures in 2001 were 73 million as compared to 64 million in 2000
driven by an increase in costs for software development and acquisition as the
company expands the infrastructure of its systems as well as the addition of
the stanley learning center a major addition at world headquarters for the
training and development of employees capital expenditures were 64 million in
2000 down from 103 million in 1999 investment in capital for 2000 was lower
than traditional levels as a result of facility consolidations continued
outsourcing and the stanley production system

banks to borrow up to 350 million at the lower of prime or money market rates
of this amount 100 million is longterm the company has shortterm lines of
credit with numerous foreign banks aggregating 113 million of which 96
million was available at december 29 2001 shortterm arrangements are reviewed

year notes payable at a fixed interest rate of 45 this 75 million obligation

lines of credit the company maintains a facility designed for the
securitization of certain trade accounts receivable for purposes of additional
liquidity as of december 29 2001 the companys maximum available funds under
this arrangement were 106 million of which the company had utilized 22
million

the company repurchased 43 million shares of its common stock in 2000 the net
effect was a decrease in equity of 111 million these repurchases were funded
primarily by cash flow from operations the company has indicated that it may
continue to repurchase its shares when deemed appropriate

     market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result
from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments the company is
exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company
through its global businesses enters into transactions and makes investments
denominated in multiple currencies the companys predominant exposures are in
european canadian and asian currencies certain crosscurrency trade flows
arising from sales and procurement activities are consolidated prior to
obtaining risk protection primarily purchased options the company is thus able
to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally
offsetting exposures to reduce the cost of purchasing protection at times the
company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to
reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated
receivables and payables predominately intercompany transactions gains and
losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the
underlying net exposures assets and liabilities being hedged management
determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities and in certain
cases may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain unhedged the
company has also entered into several crosscurrency interest rate swaps
primarily to reduce overall borrowing costs but also to provide a partial hedge
of the net investments in certain subsidiaries sensitivity to foreign currency
exposure risk from these financial instruments at the end of 2001 would have
been immaterial based on the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical
10 adverse movement in all currencies

the companys exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt
obligations shortterm investments and derivative financial instruments
employed in the management of its debt portfolio the debt portfolio is managed
to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by
using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate
swaps caps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps the companys primary
exposure to interest risk comes from its floating rate debt in the us canada
and europe and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates at december 29
2001 the result of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in short term
libor rates would not have resulted in a material impact on the pretax profit of
the company

the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around

other matters


     environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as
a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as
the remediation of previously contaminated sites future laws and regulations
are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the companys
expenditures related to routine environmental matters

the company accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and
remediation efforts in accordance with appropriate accounting guidelines which
address probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs the
liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or
remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated subject to the
imprecision in estimating future environmental costs the company believes that
any sum it may pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will not have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position results of operations or liquidity

     new accounting standards refer to note a of the notes to consolidated
financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of new accounting
pronouncements and the potential impact to the companys consolidated results of
operations and consolidated financial position

     critical accounting policies the company has determined that the following
accounting policies are critical due to the amount of estimation required

     allowance for doubtful accounts the companys estimate for its allowance
for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods the
amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the
total amount reserved first the company evaluates specific accounts where we
have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial
obligations bankruptcy etc in these

                                       20
page

cases the company uses its judgment based on the best available facts and
circumstances and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts
due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information
is received that impacts the amount reserved second a general reserve is
established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging
categories these percentages are based on historical collection and writeoff
experience if circumstances change ie higher than expected defaults or an
unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to meet its
financial obligation to the company the companys estimates of the
recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount

     inventories  lower of cost or market slow moving and obsolete the
company ensures inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and
continually reviews the book value of discontinued product lines and skus to
determine if these items are properly valued the company identifies these items
and assesses the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost if it
is determined that cost is less than market value then cost is used for
inventory valuation if market value is less than cost then the company writes
down the related inventory to that value if a write down to the current market
value is necessary the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable
value or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to complete and dispose
and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin
also called the floor the company also continually evaluates the composition of
its inventory and identifies slowmoving inventories inventory items identified
as slowmoving are evaluated to determine if reserves are required generally
the company does not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature
of its products if the company is not able to achieve its expectations of the
net realizable value of the inventory at its current value the company would
have to adjust its reserves accordingly

     offbalance sheet arrangements the companys offbalance sheet
arrangements include the following

the company has agreements to sell on a revolving basis pools of accounts and
notes receivables to two qualified special purpose entities which qualify to be
accounted for as unconsolidated subsidiaries qspes the entities are
designed to facilitate the securitization of certain trade accounts receivable
and are used to fund the mac advantage financing program and as an additional

receives a servicing fee while the qspes bear the risk of noncollection

2002 with major us financial institutions the equity forwards on stanley
common shares are designed to partially hedge the dilutive effect on earnings
per share of inthemoney stock options as the stock price fluctuates the
structure requires net share settlement and is accounted for within equity

made no cash settlement elections during the contract period

event the companys stock price declines below 19 per share or its credit
rating is downgraded to below investment grade if the stock price declines the
company may issue shares to the counterparties that exceed the favorable offset
of stock options coming outofthemoney which could cause dilution of
earnings per share the company received 1432264 shares valued at 67 million
from quarterly net share settlements in fiscal 2001

distribution centers the leases are designed and qualify as operating leases
for accounting purposes where only the monthly lease amount is recorded in the

higher percentage of the companys products in lowcost countries the success
of these initiatives is dependent on the companys ability to increase the
efficiency of its routine business processes to

and other changes within competitive markets the continued consolidation of
customers in consumer channels increasing competition changes in trade
monetary fiscal and tax policies and laws inflation currency exchange
fluctuations the impact of dollarforeign currency exchange rates on the

                         report of independent auditors

the shareowners
the stanley works

we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the stanley
works and subsidiaries as of december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 and the
related consolidated statements of operations changes in shareowners equity
and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended december
29 2001 our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at item 14a these financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the companys management our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits

we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion

in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
stanley works and subsidiaries at december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended december 29 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also in our
opinion the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein

previously defined in apb 30 sfas no 144 retains the fundamental provisions
in sfas no 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on longlived
assets held for use and longlived assets to be disposed of by sale while also
resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 121 sfas
no 144 retains the basic provisions of apb 30 on how to present discontinued
operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a
component of an entity rather than a segment of a business the company will
adopt sfas 144 effective in fiscal year 2002 upon adoption management does not
expect sfas no 144 to have a material impact on the companys financial

accounting sfas 141 also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that
are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill the

covered benefits ie health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 120 for
2002 reducing gradually to 6 by 2012 and remaining at that level thereafter a
one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would
have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 6 million

is more likely than not to be

realized reversal of the valuation allowance is contingent upon the recognition
of future taxable income and capital gains in specific foreign countries and

benefits to become more likely than not

undistributed foreign earnings of 622 million at december 29 2001 are
considered to be invested indefinitely or will be remitted substantially free of
additional tax accordingly no provision has been made for taxes that might be
payable upon remittance of such earnings nor is it practicable to determine the
amount of this liability


q commitments

future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases principally
related to facilities vehicles machinery and equipment in millions of
dollars as of december 29 2001 were 136 in 2002 216 in 2003 204 in
2004 49 in 2005 32 in 2006 and 112 thereafter minimum payments have not
been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of 41 million due in the future under
noncancelable subleases rental expense for operating leases amounted to 368
million in 2001 463 million in 2000 and 427 million in 1999

the company has entered into certain outsourcing arrangements principally
related to information systems telecommunications and freight administration
which expire at various dates through 2009 the future estimated minimum
payments under these commitments in millions of dollars as of december 29
2001 were 129 in 2002 96 in 2003 80 in 2004 77 in 2005 77 in 2006
and 157 thereafter


r contingencies

in the normal course of business the company is involved in various lawsuits
and claims in addition the company is a party to a number of proceedings
before federal and state regulatory agencies relating to environmental
remediation also the company along with many other companies has been named
as a potentially responsible party prp in a number of administrative
proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites including nine active
superfund sites current laws potentially impose joint and several liability
upon each prp in assessing its potential liability at these sites the company
has considered the following the solvency of the other prps whether
responsibility is being disputed the terms of existing agreements experience
at similar sites and the fact that the companys volumetric contribution at
these sites is relatively small

the companys policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation
costs for identified sites when it is probable that a


                                      f32
page



liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated
the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently
available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors
as existing technology presently enacted laws and regulations and prior
experience in remediation of contaminated sites the liabilities recorded do not
take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties as
assessments and remediation progress at individual sites the amounts recorded
are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal
information that becomes available as of december 29 2001 the company had
reserves of 146 million primarily for remediation activities associated with
companyowned properties as well as for superfund sites

the environmental liability for certain sites that have cash payments that are
fixed or reliably determinable have been discounted at a rate of 6 as of
december 29 2001 the discounted and undiscounted amount of the liability
relative to these sites is 8228000 and 6332000 respectively the payments
relative to these sites are expected to be 4919000 in 2002 1956000 in
2003 439000 in 2004 429000 in 2005 424000 in 2006 and 4576000
thereafter

the amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates
amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional
technical and legal information that becomes available actual costs to be
incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates given the inherent
uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures subject to the imprecision in
estimating future contingent liability costs the company does not expect that
any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the
amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial
position results of operations or liquidity


s subsequent event

on february 8 2002 the company filed a form s4 registration statement with
the us securities and exchange commission for approval of a reorganization to
reincorporate the company in bermuda
