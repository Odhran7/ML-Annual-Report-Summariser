significant 2021 acquisitions and divestitures 

on february 26 2021 we acquired all leasehold interests and related assets of guidon operating llc the “guidon acquisition” which included approximately 32500 net acres in the northern midland basin in exchange for 1068 million shares of the company’s common stock and 375 million of cash 

on march 17 2021 we acquired qep resources inc ”qep” in a transaction structured as a merger the “qep merger” the addition of qep’s assets increased our net acreage in the midland basin by approximately 49000 net acres under the terms of the merger agreement with qep we issued approximately 1212 million shares of our common stock to the former qep stockholders constituting a total value at the closing date of approximately 987 million 

on october 21 2021 we completed the divestiture of our williston basin oil and natural gas assets consisting of approximately 95000 net acres acquired in the qep merger for net cash proceeds of approximately 586 million after customary closing adjustments 

see note 4— acquisitions and divestitures included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures during 2021 

covid19 and effects on commodity prices 

after briefly reaching negative levels in april 2020 oil prices recovered during 2021 closing at 8543 per bbl as of january 18 2022 per bbl wti spurred by the global economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic and producer restraint demand for oil and natural gas increased during 2021 as many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the us and globally the emergence of the delta covid19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant however contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook further on january 4 2022 opec and its nonopec allies known collectively as opec agreed to continue their program commenced in august of 2021 of gradual monthly output increases in february 2022 raising its output target by 400000 bbls per day which move is expected to further boost oil supply in response to rising demand in its report issued on february 10 2022 opec noted its expectation that world oil demand will rise by 415 million bbls per day in 2022 as the global economy continues to post a strong recovery from the covid19 pandemic although this demand outlook is expected to underpin oil prices already seen at a sevenyear high in february 2022 we cannot predict any future volatility in commodity prices or demand for crude oil 

despite the recovery in commodity prices and rising demand we kept our production relatively flat during 2021 using excess cash flow for debt repayment andor return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program 

our business strategy 

our business strategy includes the following 

• exercise capital discipline during 2021 we continued building on our execution track record generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control our efficiency gains particularly in the midland basin drilling and completion programs enabled us to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on well costs which led to a total capital expenditure amount of 15 billion down 11 from our guidance presented in april of 2021 we expect to continue to exercise capital discipline and plan to spend between 175 billion and 190 billion in 2022 with the goal of maintaining flat oil production throughout the year this capital range accounts for the inflationary pressures we expect to see in 2022 

• focus on low cost development strategy and continuous improvement in operational capital allocation and cost efficiencies our acreage position is generally in contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities we are the operator of approximately 99 of our acreage which allows us to efficiently manage our operating costs pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production our average 85 working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies 

• continue to deliver on our enhanced capital return program we expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on our enhanced capital return program through which we intend to distribute 50 of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing base dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends 

• leverage our experience operating in the permian basin our executive team which has significant experience in the permian basin intends to continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by optimizing and enhancing our drilling and completion techniques our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques is an important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential drilling locations we believe that the experience of our executive team in deviated and horizontal drilling and completions has helped reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths in addition our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate and implement hydraulic fracturing practices that have and are expected to continue to increase recovery and reduce completion costs our executive team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other top operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance and adopt best practices compared to our peers 

• pursue strategic acquisitions with substantial resource potential we have a proven history of acquiring leasehold positions in the permian basin that have substantial oilweighted resource potential our executive team with its extensive experience in the permian basin has what we believe is a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to evaluate resource potential during 2021 we completed 

the qep merger which increased our net acreage in the midland basin by approximately 49000 net acres also during 2021 we completed the guidon acquisition which included approximately 32500 net acres in the northern midland basin these acquisitions combined with our developmental activities contributed to an increase in our total proved reserves of approximately 36 in 2021 we regularly review acquisition opportunities and intend to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets 

• maintain financial flexibility we seek to maintain a conservative financial position as of december 31 2021 diamondback had 595 million of standalone cash and cash equivalents and our borrowing base was set at 16 billion which was fully available for future borrowings as of december 31 2021 viper llc had 39 million of cash and cash equivalents 304 million in outstanding borrowings and 196 million available for future borrowings under its operating company’s revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 rattler llc had 20 million of cash and cash equivalents 195 million in outstanding borrowings and 405 million available for future borrowings under its operating company’s revolving credit facility 

• deliver on our commitment to esg performance  we are committed to the safe and responsible development of our resources in the permian basin our approach to environmental social and governance “esg” matters is evidenced through our commitment to people environmental responsibility community and sound governance practices specifically in february 2021 we announced significant enhancements to our esg performance and disclosure including scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets as well as the implementation of our “net zero now” initiative under which effective january 1 2021 we strive to produce every hydrocarbon with zero scope 1 emissions in september 2021 we announced our longterm goal to end routine flaring by 2025 and a longterm target to source over 65 of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025 

our strengths 

we believe the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals 

• oil rich resource base in one of north america’s leading resource plays substantially all of our leasehold acreage is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in north america the permian basin in west texas the majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the permian basin our production for the year ended december 31 2021 was approximately 60 oil 20 natural gas liquids and 20 natural gas as of december 31 2021 our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 52 oil 24 natural gas liquids and 24 natural gas 

• multiyear drilling inventory in one of north america’s leading oil resource plays we have identified a multiyear inventory of potential drilling locations for our oilweighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities at an assumed economic price of approximately 5000 per bbl wti we currently have approximately 9314 gross 6311 net identified potential horizontal drilling locations on our acreage based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data these gross identified economic potential horizontal locations have an average lateral length of approximately 8646 feet with the actual length depending on lease geometry and other considerations these locations exist across most of our acreage blocks and in multiple horizons the ultimate interwell spacing at these locations may vary due to different factors which would result in a higher or lower location count in addition we have approximately 4980 square miles of proprietary 3d seismic data covering our acreage this data facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity including additional horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions 

• experienced incentivized and proven management team our executive team has a proven track record of executing on multirig development drilling programs and extensive experience in the permian basin in addition our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing horizontal wells in addition to horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise which is of strategic importance as we expand our horizontal drilling activity 

• favorable operating environment we have focused our drilling and development operations in the permian basin one of the longest operating hydrocarbon basins in the united states with a long and wellestablished production history and developed infrastructure we believe that the geological and regulatory environment of the permian basin is more stable and predictable and that we are faced with less operational risks in the permian basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins 

• high degree of operational control we are the operator of approximately 99 of our permian basin acreage this operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes we retain the ability to increase or decrease our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks this operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects 

• access to midstream infrastructure and gathering and transportation pipelines  through our publicly traded subsidiary rattler and joint ventures in which it owns an interest we have secured access to midstream infrastructure and crude oil and ngl gathering and transportation pipelines tailored to our expected levels of production in order to allow us the operational flexibility to execute on our business plan rattler is the primary provider of crude oil gathering and transportation and water sourcing and distribution service to us with an acreage dedication that spans a total of approximately 450000 gross acres across all of rattler’s service lines and over the core of the midland and delaware basins 

our properties 

location and land 

the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states as of december 31 2021 our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 524700 gross 445848 net acres which consisted primarily of approximately 292903 gross 265562 net acres in the midland basin and approximately 189357 gross 148588 net acres in the delaware basin in addition our publicly traded subsidiary viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 930871 gross acres and 27027 net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale approximately 54 of these net royalty acres are operated by us 

we have been developing multiple pay intervals in the permian basin through horizontal drilling and believe that there are opportunities to target additional intervals throughout the stratigraphic column we believe our significant experience drilling completing and operating horizontal wells will allow us to efficiently develop our remaining inventory and ultimately target other horizons that have limited development to date the following table presents horizontal producing wells in which we have a working interest as of december 31 2021 



1 of these 2842 total horizontal producing wells we are the operator of 2378 wells and have a nonoperated working interest in 464 additional wells 

the following table presents the average number of days in which we were able to drill our horizontal wells to total depth specified below during the year ended december 31 2021 



further advances in drilling and completion technology may result in economic development of zones that are not currently viable 

our subsidiary rattler is focused on ownership operation development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the midland and delaware basins of the permian basin rattler’s crude oil infrastructure assets consist of gathering pipelines and metering facilities which collectively gather crude oil for its customers rattler’s facilities gather crude oil from horizontal and vertical wells in our reward spanish trail pecos and fivestones areas within the permian basin rattler’s water sourcing and distribution assets consists of water wells frac pits pipelines and water treatment and recycling facilities which collectively gather and distribute water from permian basin aquifers to the drilling and completion sites through buried pipelines and temporary surface pipelines additionally rattler previously owned natural gas gathering assets substantially all of which were divested in the fourth quarter of 2021 subsequent to the divestiture of these assets we utilize third party services and joint ventures in which rattler owns equity interests discussed below for gathering and transportation of our natural gas production 

as of december 31 2021 rattler owned and operated 866 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines and a fully integrated water system on acreage that overlays our nine core midland and delaware basin development areas to facilitate the transportation of water and crude oil volumes away from the producing wellhead to ensure the efficient operations of a crude oil well rattler’s midstream infrastructure includes a network of gathering pipelines that collect and transport crude oil and produced water from our operations in the midland and delaware basins we have entered into multiple feebased commercial agreements with rattler each with an initial term ending in 2034 utilizing rattler’s infrastructure assets or its planned infrastructure assets to provide an array of essential services critical to our upstream operations in the delaware and midland basins our agreements with rattler include substantial acreage dedications

rattler also owns and operates certain real estate assets in midland texas including the fasken center which has over 421000 net rentable square feet within its two office towers 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry bone spring wolfcamp strawn atoka and barnettmeramec formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations which we collectively refer to as the wolfberry play since then we and most other operators are almost exclusively drilling horizontal wells in the development of unconventional reservoirs in the permian basin as of december 31 2021 we held working interests in 5289 gross 4430 net producing wells and only royalty interests in 6455 additional wells 

geology 

the greater permian basin formed as an area of rapid pennsylvanianpermian subsidence in response to dynamic structural influence of the marathon uplift and ancestral rockies it is one of the most productive sedimentary basins in the us with established oil and natural gas production from several stacked reservoirs of varying age ranges most notably permian aged sediments in particular the permian aged wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring formations have been heavily targeted for several decades first through vertical comingling of these zones and more recently through horizontal exploitation of each individual horizon prior to deposition of the wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring formations the area of the presentday permian basin was a continuous sedimentary feature called the tabosa basin during this time ordovician silurian devonian and mississippian sediments were laid down in a primarily open marine shelf setting however some time frames saw more restrictive settings that were conducive to the deposition of organically rich mudstone such as the devonian woodford and mississippian barnettmeramec these formations are important sources and more recently reservoirs within the presentday greater permian basin 

the spraberry and bone spring formations were deposited as siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites and debris flows along with pelagic mudstones in a deepwater basinal environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow grainflow and finegrained pelagic sediments which were also deposited in a basinal setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring are generally found in close proximity to the central basin platform while mudstone reservoirs thicken basinward away from the central basin platform the mudstone within these reservoirs is organically rich which when buried to sufficient depth for thermal maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the mudstones themselves and in the interbedded conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs due to this complexity the wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring intervals are a hybrid reservoir system that contains characteristics of both unconventional and conventional reservoirs 

we have successfully developed several hybrid reservoir intervals within the clearfork spraberrybone spring wolfcamp and barnettmeramec formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the mudstones and some clastics exhibit low permeabilities which necessitate the need for hydraulic fracture stimulation to unlock the vast storage of hydrocarbons in these targets 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 4980 square miles of 3d data this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling program and identification of additional resources to be exploited 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2021 net production from our acreage was 137002 mboe or an average of 375348 boed of which approximately 60 was oil 20 was natural gas liquids and 20 was natural gas 

  

recent and future activity 

during 2022 we expect to drill an estimated 270 to 290 gross 248 to 267 net operated horizontal wells and complete an estimated 260 to 280 gross 240 to 258 net operated horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2022 will be between 175 billion and 190 billion consisting of 156 billion to 167 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity and capital workovers 110 million to 130 million for infrastructure and environmental and 80 million to 100 million for midstream investments excluding joint venture investments and the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2021 we drilled 216 gross 203 net and completed 275 gross 258 net operated horizontal wells during the year ended december 31 2021 our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells and infrastructure additions to oil and natural gas properties were 15 billion in addition we spent 30 million for oil and natural gas midstream assets 

we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews at december 31 2021 and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 rigs and three and four completion crews on average in 2022 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2021 were estimated using a deterministic method 

the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves approximately 95 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 5 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing 

requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

the process of estimating oil natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “ item 1a risk factors ” of this report as a result we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and natural gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

prior to his retirement effective december 31 2021 our executive vice president and chief engineer was primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all our reserve estimates effective january 1 2022 our senior vice president of reservoir engineering has assumed these responsibilities we collectively refer to these individuals as the primary reserve engineers the primary reserve engineers are petroleum engineers with over 30 and 18 years of reservoir and operations experience respectively and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 15 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and natural gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates is completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

• review and verification of historical production data which is based on actual production as reported by us 

• preparation of reserve estimates by the primary reserve engineers or under their direct supervision 

• review by the primary reserve engineers of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions 

• direct reporting responsibilities by our executive vice president and chief engineer prior to his retirement to our chief executive officer and by the current primary reserve engineer to our executive vice president—operations 

• verification of property ownership by our land department and 

• no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked 

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states as of december 31 2021 none of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 



1 estimates of reserves as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in accordance with sec guidelines reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties all of which are located within the continental united states although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual future production cash flows taxes development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates see “ item 1a risk factors ” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with our estimates of proved reserves and related factors and see note 21— supplemental information on oil and natural gas operations for further discussion of our reserve estimates and pricing 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2021 our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 307815 mbbls of oil 815119 mmcf of natural gas and 144221 mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 587889 mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2021 mboe 



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 416327 mboe from 439 gross 383 net wells in which we have a working interest and 24700 mboe from 336 gross wells in which viper owns royalty interests of the 439 gross working interest wells 409 were in the midland basin and 30 were in the delaware basin transfers of 172526 mboe from undeveloped to developed reserves were the result of drilling or participating in 154 gross 142 net horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 127 gross wells in which we have a royalty interest or mineral interest through viper we own a working interest in 106 of the 127 gross viper wells downward revisions of 243268 mboe were the result of negative revisions of 260494 mboe due to downgrades related to changes in the corporate development plan following the qep merger and the guidon acquisition these negative revisions were partially 

offset with positive revisions of 17226 mboe primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and improved well performance purchases of 63013 mboe were the result of 59023 mboe primarily from qep and guidon and 3990 mboe of viper’s royalty interest purchases 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 516 million during 2021 estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 844 million in 2022 1053 million in 2023 983 million in 2024 and 381 million in 2025 since our formation in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced and we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

we have identified a multiyear inventory of potential drilling locations for our oilweighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities at an assumed price of approximately 5000 per bbl wti we currently have approximately 9314 gross 6311 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations on our acreage based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data with our current development plan we expect to continue our strong pud conversion ratio in 2022 by converting an estimated 25 of our puds to a proved developed category and developing approximately 86 of the consolidated 2021 yearend pud reserves by the end of 2024 as of december 31 2021 all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded 

the following table presents the number of identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations by basin 



1 our current location count is based on 660 foot to 880 foot spacing in midland martin and northeast andrews counties depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties 

2 our current location count is based on 660 foot to 880 foot spacing in midland and howard counties depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties

as of december 31 2021 we owned an interest in a total of 11744 gross productive wells with an average unweighted 84 working interest in 5289 gross 4430 net wells and an average 17 royalty interest in 6455 additional wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average 33 net revenue interest in 9095 of the total 11744 gross productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

the following table sets forth information regarding productive wells by basin as of december 31 2021 



drilling results 

the following tables set forth information with respect to the number of wells drilled during the periods indicated by basin each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 







as of december 31 2021 we had 24 gross 23 net operated wells in the process of drilling and 129 gross 118 net in the process of completion or waiting on completion 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2021 relating to our leasehold acreage 



1 does not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease large portions of the acreage that are considered developed under sec guidelines are developed with vertical wells or horizontal wells that are in a single horizon we believe much of this acreage has significant remaining development potential in one or more intervals with horizontal wells 

2 does not include viper’s mineral interests but does include leasehold acres that we own underlying our mineral interests 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

as of december 31 2021 the following gross and net undeveloped acres are set to expire over the next 5 years based on their contractual lease maturities unless i production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or ii the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the contractual expiration dates 



title to properties 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties 

and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion an updated title review or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2021 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 four purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue we do not require collateral and do not believe the loss of any single purchaser would materially impact our operating results as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers for additional information regarding our customer concentrations see note 3— revenue from contracts with customers included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

delivery commitments 

certain of our firm sales agreements for oil include delivery commitments that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity we believe our current production and reserves are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however these contracts provide the options of delivering thirdparty volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment for additional information regarding commitments see note 18— commitments and contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and in our upstream segment we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils 

in our midstream operations segment as rattler seeks to expand its crude oil and waterrelated midstream services it faces a high level of competition including major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather compress treat process transport store or market oil and natural gas as rattler seeks to expand to provide its midstream services to third party producers it similarly faces a high level of competition competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids within the acreage dedicated by us to rattler rattler does not compete with other midstream companies to provide us with midstream services as a result of our relationship and longterm dedications to rattler’s midstream assets however we may continue to use third party service providers for certain midstream services within such dedicated acreage until the expiration or termination of certain preexisting dedications additionally subsequent to the divestiture of substantially all of rattler’s natural gas gathering assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 third parties and joint ventures in which rattler owns equity interests discussed above provide all of our natural gas gathering and transportation services 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production in the midland and delaware basins are transported to purchasers by pipeline 

the following table presents the average percentage of produced oil sold by pipeline and the average percentage of produced water connected to produced water disposal wells by pipeline 



we have entered into multiple feebased commercial agreements with rattler each with an initial term ending in 2034 utilizing rattler’s infrastructure assets or its planned infrastructure assets to provide an array of essential services critical to our upstream operations in the delaware and midland basins our agreements with rattler include an acreage dedication consisting of a total of approximately 450000 gross acres across all rattler’s service lines located within the midland and delaware basins 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 15 to 35 resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 65 to 85 

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas buyers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations in our exploration and production business seasonal weather conditions such as the severe winter storms in the permian basin in early 2021 and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters 

our oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is often strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not 

experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling the resource conservation and recovery act or the rcra as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the rcra sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the rcra such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in the us congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” also in december 2016 the epa agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and natural gas waste however in april 2019 the epa concluded that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of oil and natural gas waste are not necessary at this time any changes in such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released 

water discharges the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” or the cwa the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act or the opa and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak the cwa and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 

the scope of waters regulated under the cwa has fluctuated in recent years on june 29 2015 the epa and the us army corps of engineers or the corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the cwa however on october 22 2019 the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 rules and then on april 21 2020 the epa and the corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the cwa on august 30 2021 a federal court struck down the replacement rule and on december 7 2021 the epa and the corps published a proposed rule that would put back into place the pre2015 definition of “waters of the united states” updated to reflect supreme court decisions while the agencies continue to consult with stakeholders on future regulatory actions as a result of such recent developments substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters 

protected under the cwa to the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the cwa’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas 

the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 

the opa is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 

noncompliance with the cwa or the opa may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions the federal clean air act or the caa as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal caa that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which are discussed in more detail below in “—regulation of hydraulic fracturing” also on may 12 2016 the epa issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal caa and associated state laws and regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 

climate change in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs in addition states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and natural gas operations for example on november 4 2020 the texas railroad commission adopted new guidance on when flaring is permissible requiring operators to submit more specific information to justify the need to flare or vent gas 

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions although the united states withdrew from the paris agreement effective november 4 2020 president biden issued an executive order on january 20 2021 to rejoin the paris agreement which went into effect on february 19 2021 on april 21 2021 the united states announced that it was setting an economywide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 5052 percent below 2005 levels in 2030 in november 2021 in connection with the 26th conference of the parties in glasgow scotland the united states and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 by 2030 furthermore many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding and insurance underwriters to limit coverages to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

moreover climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions such as the severe winter storms in the permian basin in february 2021 can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of the us congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal caa that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration in particular on may 12 2016 the epa amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new modified and reconstructed equipment processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector however on august 13 2020 in response to an executive order by former president trump to review and revise unduly burdensome regulations the epa amended the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards to ease regulatory burdens including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether on june 30 2021 president biden signed into law a joint 

resolution of the us congress disapproving the 2020 amendments with the exception of some technical changes thereby reinstating the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards the epa expects owners and operators of regulated sources to take “immediate steps” to comply with these standards additionally on november 15 2021 the epa published a proposed rule that would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry by requiring increased monitoring of fugitive emissions imposing new requirements for pneumatic controllers and tank batteries and prohibiting venting of natural gas in certain situations these new standards to the extent implemented as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 

several states including texas and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas legislature adopted legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and natural gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits and temporarily suspend operations for waste disposal wells and in september 2021 the texas railroad commission curtailed the amount of water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near midland and odessa in the permian basin and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas these restrictions on use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells could result in increased operating costs requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means all of which could be costly we or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes disposal rates and pressures or locations or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells these factors may make drilling and completion activity in the affected parts of the permian basin less economical and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal state or local level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to permitting delays 

and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

endangered species 

the federal endangered species act or esa and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitats if endangered species are located in areas where we operate our operations or any work performed related to them could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in compliance with the esa however the designation of previously unprotected species such as dunes sagebrush lizard in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production 

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated the us congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by the us congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 

drilling and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the timing of construction or drilling activities including seasonal wildlife closures the rates of production or “allowables” the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and notice to and consultation with surface owners and other third parties 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate although the corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 

natural gas sales historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 

oil sales and transportation sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless the us congress could reenact price controls in the future 

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and our subsidiary rattler llc has a tariff on file with ferc to perform oil gathering service in interstate commerce intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines including our subsidiary rattler llc must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 

safety and maintenance regulation in our midstream operations rattler llc is subject to regulation by the us department of transportation or dot under the hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of 1979 or hlpsa and comparable state statutes with respect to design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline facilities hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products including natural gas liquids and condensate and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the united states secretary of transportation these regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these hlpsa regulations 

rattler llc is also subject to the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 the pipeline safety improvement act establishes mandatory inspections for all united states crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering pipelines in highconsequence areas within ten years dot through the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration or phmsa has developed regulations implementing the pipeline safety improvement act that requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other safety protections in areas where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property 

the pipeline safety and job creation act enacted in 2011 and the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 also known as the pipes act enacted in 2016 amended the hlpsa and increased safety regulation the pipeline safety and job creation act doubles the maximum administrative fines for safety violations from 100000 to 200000 for a single violation and from 10 million to 20 million for a related series of violations now increased for inflation to 225134 and 2251334 respectively and provides that these maximum penalty caps do not apply to civil enforcement actions establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines including the expansion of integrity management use of automatic and remotecontrolled shutoff valves leak detection systems sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines use of excess flow valves verification of maximum allowable operating pressure incident notification and other pipelinesafety related requirements the pipes act ensures that the phmsa completes the pipeline safety and job creation act requirements reforms phmsa to be a more dynamic datadriven regulator and closes gaps in federal standards 

phmsa has undertaken rulemakings to address many areas of this legislation for example on october 1 2019 phmsa published final rules to expand its integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on regulated pipelines including certain segments outside high consequence areas the rules once effective also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated gathering lines the safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the pipeline safety and job creation act and the pipes act as well as any implementation of phmsa rules thereunder andor related rule making proceedings could require us to install new or modified safety controls pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in addition any material penalties or fines issued to us under these or other statutes rules regulations or orders could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards and many states have undertaken responsibility to enforce the federal standards for example on december 17 2019 the texas railroad commission adopted rules requiring that operators of gathering lines take appropriate actions to fix safety hazards we do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable federal and state laws and regulations in texas our gathering pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements 

in addition we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act or osha and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers moreover the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens rattler llc and the entities in which it owns an interest are also subject to osha process safety management regulations which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic reactive flammable or explosive chemicals these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas pressurized tanks caverns and wells in excess of 10000 pounds at various locations flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt from these standards also the department of homeland security and other agencies such as the epa continue to develop regulations concerning the security of industrial facilities including crude oil and natural gas facilities we are subject to a number of requirements and must prepare federal response plans to comply we must also prepare risk management plans under the regulations promulgated by the epa to implement the requirements under the caa to prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances we have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with safeguard and security requirements we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety and security 

state regulation texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our thirdparty vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for property damage and injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

human capital 

we have developed a culture grounded upon the solid foundation of our core values—leadership integrity excellence people and teamwork—that are adhered to throughout our company we set a high bar for all of our employees in terms of how they operate and interact both within the office and out in the field we challenge them to identify new ways to foster a better future for themselves and for us our board of directors through its safety sustainability and corporate responsibility committee which we refer to as the sscr committee provides an important oversight of our human capital management strategy including diversity equity and inclusion in january 2022 the sscr committee’s charter was amended accordingly to include oversight of management of human capital as part of its ongoing responsibilities the sscr committee receives regular updates from our executive leadership senior management and thirdparty consultants on human capital trends and other key human capital matters impacting our business 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 870 full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also utilize independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our fulltime employees 

diversity inclusion recruiting and retention 

equal employment opportunity is one of our core tenets and as such our employment decisions are based on merit qualifications competencies and contributions we actively seek to attract and retain an increasingly diverse workforce and continue to cultivate an inclusive and respectful work environment we deeply value the perspectives and experiences from our diverse personnel and are proud of our team rich in a range of ethnic cultural and ideological backgrounds nearly a third of our employees are women and over 25 of our employees selfidentify as ethnic minorities we took various actions during 2021 to increase the diversity in our candidate pool and broaden our outreach particularly within our college recruiting and internship programs through various student organizations to support this inclusion effort which will continue in the future in addition we have focused on recruiting experienced hires to target and retain top industry talent we have historically had a low annual voluntary attrition rate representing approximately 13 in 2021 despite the challenging labor market and increased competition for talent impacted by the covid19 pandemic we believe that our low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of our corporate culture focused on diversity and inclusion teamwork and commitment to employee development and career advancement discussed in more detail below 

health and safety 

protecting employees the public and the environment is a top priority in our operations and in the way we manage our assets we are focused on minimizing the risk of workplace incidents and preparing for emergencies as an ingrained element of our corporate responsibility we also strive to comply with all applicable health safety and environmental standards laws and regulations 

we have committed to reduce injuries and fatalities in our business and are focused on safety culture improvements safety leadership actions and human performance principles we are requiring our operational employees and independent contractors and their employees to go through safelandusa orientation and training which program is aligned with the international association of oil  gas producers life saving rules and also meets the operational safety requirements adopted by the american petroleum institute we also involve employees from all operational levels in our safety program to provide input and suggested improvements to the overall safety program recommended preventative measures based on reviewing vehicle and personnel incidents safety and environmental audits at operational locations and audit and oversight of the diamondback hazard communication program 

from 2017 through 2021 we had no employee workrelated fatalities our employee osha recordable cases comprising workrelated injuries and illnesses that require medical treatment beyond first aid totaled two in 2021 down from three in 2020 our employee total recordable incident rate trir in 2021 was 025 in 2021 down from 042 in 2020 and losttime incident rate ltir was 012 in 2021 down from 014 in 2020 we have set a shortterm target of maintaining an employee trir of 05 or less 

training and development 

we support employees in pursuing training opportunities to expand their professional skills our internal course offerings in 2021 included a wide array of topics in addition to extensive safety and other compliance training sessions additionally our people also undergo training and education each year on regulatory compliance industry standards and innovative opportunities to effectively manage the challenges of developing our resources we have also implemented development programs that are designed to build leadership capabilities at all levels 

our facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located at the fasken center in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland texas oklahoma city oklahoma and denver colorado

 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business and properties” item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

our business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic and volatility in the oil and natural gas markets in addition if commodity prices decrease our production estimates of proved reserves and liquidity may be adversely affected 

after turning negative in april 2020 nymex wti prices have recovered closing at 8543 per bbl as of january 18 2022 as demand for oil and natural gas increased and many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the us and globally the emergence of the delta covid19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant however contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook despite the recent recovery in demand for oil and natural gas and commodity prices we have kept production on our acreage relatively flat during 2021 using excess cash flow for debt repayment andor return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program we intend to continue exercising capital discipline by maintaining our oil production flat in 2022 at the fourth quarter 2021 level we cannot reasonably predict whether production levels will remain at current levels or the full extent of the events above and any subsequent recovery may have on our industry and our business 

due to the improvement in commodity pricing environment and industry conditions we did not record any impairments in 2021 however if commodity prices fall below current levels we may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material further if commodity prices decrease our production proved reserves and cash flows will be adversely impacted reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to present operational health labor logistics and other challenges and it is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and cash flows 

there are many variables and uncertainties regarding the covid19 pandemic including the emergence contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus and their severity the effectiveness of treatments or vaccines against the virus or its new strains the extent of travel restrictions business closures and other measures that are or may be imposed in affected areas or countries by governmental authorities disruptions in the supply chain an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the covid19 pandemic increased logistics costs additional costs due to remote working arrangements adherence to social distancing guidelines and other covid19related challenges further there remain increased risks of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in a remote working environment increased privacyrelated risks due to processing healthrelated personal information absence of workforce due to illness the impact of the pandemic on any of our contractual counterparties and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial it is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and cash flows 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production the cost of exploring for developing producing and delivering oil and natural gas the price and quantity of foreign imports political and economic conditions in oil producing countries including the middle east africa south 

america and russia the potential impact of any russianukrainian conflict on the global energy markets the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action including us military operations in the middle east the ability of members of the opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts the level of consumer product demand extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters risks associated with operating drilling rigs technological advances affecting energy consumption the price and availability of alternative fuels domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes including the biden administration’s energy and environmental policies global or national health concerns including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such as covid19 and its variants the proximity cost availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall domestic and global economic conditions our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by any future government rule regulation or order that may impose production limits as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints in the permian basin where we operate 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during 2021 nymex wti prices ranged from 4762 to 8465 per bbl and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas ranged from 245 to 631 per mmbtu if the prices of oil and natural gas decline our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and to maintain the production in paying quantities and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells and maintaining such production we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2021 our total capital expenditures including expenditures for drilling completion infrastructure and additions to midstream assets were approximately 15 billion our 2022 capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 175 billion to 190 billion representing an increase of 23 from our 2021 capital expenditures since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations while future acquisitions may also be funded from operations as well as proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including our proved reserves the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold our ability to acquire locate and produce economically new reserves and our ability to borrow under our credit facility 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2022 could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements or our costs of capital increase we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including recoverable reserves future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals if these acquisitions include geographic regions in which we do not currently operate we could be subject to unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our financial position and results of operations may also fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs 

as of december 31 2021 we have approximately 9314 gross 6311 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately 5000 per bbl wti as of december 31 2021 only 602 of our gross identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure unusual or unexpected geological formations title problems facility or equipment malfunctions unexpected operational events inclement weather environmental and other regulatory requirements and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition as of december 31 2021 we have identified approximately 2531 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business through december 31 2021 we are the operator of have participated in or have acquired working interest in a total of 2842 horizontal producing wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2022 we will need to operate at least a onerig program any nonrenewal or other loss of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into commodity price derivatives for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2022 and 2023 production we may still be adversely affected by declines in the price of oil and may be exposed to other risks including counterparty credit risk 

we use commodity price derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further we may not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 

at settlement market prices for commodities may exceed the contract prices in our commodity price derivatives agreements resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties further by using commodity derivative instruments we expose ourselves to credit risk if we are in a positive position at contract settlement and the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract we do not require collateral from our counterparties 

for additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of december 31 2021 see note 15— derivatives to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contracts which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to longterm crude oil agreements under which subject to certain terms and conditions we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to our counterparties our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions beyond our control if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 72 million at december 31 2021 and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 598 million at december 31 2021 joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers see “business and properties—oil and natural gas production prices and production costs—marketing and customers” for additional information regarding these customers this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by any adverse changes in economic and other conditions we do not require our customers to post collateral under certain circumstances the revenue due to them can be offset by any unpaid receivables the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense we use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the year ended december 31 2021 impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties of 60 billion and 08 billion were recorded for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities—oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

approximately 33 of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31 2021 were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling and completion operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves 

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 

our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids and extreme weather conditions such as the severe winter storms in the permian basin in february 2021 and their adverse impact on production volumes availability of electrical power road accessibility and transportation facilities in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of december 31 2021 most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the wolfberry play in the midland basin this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field 

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production see “business and properties—oil and natural gas production prices and production costs—marketing and customers” for additional information regarding these customers the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operators of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water 

districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

recent regulatory restrictions on use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells in the permian basin to stem rising seismic activity and earthquakes could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in september 2021 the texas railroad commission curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near midland and odessa in the permian basin and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas these actions were taken in an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increases in earthquakes in the permian basin which have been linked by the us and local seismologists to wastewater disposal in oil fields these restrictions on the disposal of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water disposal wells could result in increased operating costs requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water recycle it or dispose of it by other means all of which could be costly we or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes disposal rates and pressures or locations or require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells these factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the permian basin less economical and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve developing and utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to the following 

• spacing of wells to maximize economic return 

• landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone 

• staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation 

• running our casing the entire length of the well bore and 

• being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore 

risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to 

• fracture stimulate the planned number of stages 

• run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations 

• successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage and 

• prevent unintentional communication with other wells 

furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we 

anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering line which interconnects with third party pipelines our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with a purchaser or into a thirdparty gathering system we do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations further these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us in addition federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the longterm and at the state and local levels see item 1 “business—regulation” for a detailed description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may 

lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

derivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the july 2010 doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which we refer to as doddfrank act provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission which we refer to as the cftc the sec and federal regulators of financial institutions which we refer to as the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities 

although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act remain to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued many rules to implement the doddfrank act including a rule which we refer to as the mandatory clearing rule requiring clearing of hedges or swaps that are subject to it currently only certain interest rate and credit default swaps a rule which we refer to as the end user exception establishing an “end user” exception to the mandatory clearing rule a rule which we refer to as the margin rule setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the margin rule for end users that are not financial end users which exception we refer to as the nonfinancial end user exception and a rule imposing position limits which we refer to as the position limit rule and also an exception to the position limit rule for swaps that constitute a “bona fide hedging transaction or position” within the definition of such term under the position limit rule subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the position limit rule which we refer to as the bona fide hedging exception 

we qualify for the end user exception to the mandatory clearing rule we qualify for the nonfinancial end user exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the margin rule and each of our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitutes a “bona fide hedging transaction or position” under the position limit rule and we intend to undertake the filing recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging exception under the position limit rule so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules however most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the end user exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers major swap participants financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the nonfinancial end user exception in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations including laws and regulations giving the european union financial authorities the power to writedown amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations andor require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts which we refer to collectively as foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations which we refer to as foreign counterparties and the us adopted law and rules which we call the us resolution stay rules clarifying similar rights of us banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation the doddfrank act the rules which have been adopted and not vacated the limit rule and the us resolution stay rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties the foreign regulations could have similar effects if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the doddfrank act and regulation the us resolution stay rules and foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the doddfrank act and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and our results of operations 

future us tax legislation may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and natural gas industry including i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration development or similar activities could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements 

with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations we maintain insurance to protect against claims made for bodily injury and property damage and that insurance includes coverage for cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have limited coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

changes in environmental laws could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business financial condition and cash flows 

president biden has indicated that he is supportive of and has issued executive orders promoting various programs and initiatives designed to among other things curtail climate change control the release of methane from new and existing oil and natural gas operations and decarbonize electric generation and the transportation sector it remains unclear what additional actions president biden will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from congress further it is uncertain to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations may affect our business or operations however such actions could significantly increase our operating costs or impair our ability to explore and develop other projects which could adversely impact our business financial condition and cash flows 

our operations depend heavily on electrical power internet and telecommunication infrastructure and information and computer systems if any of these systems are compromised or unavailable our business could be adversely affected 

we are heavily dependent on electrical power internet and telecommunications infrastructure and our information systems and computerbased programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing 

and accounting data if any of such infrastructure systems or programs were to fail or become unavailable or compromised or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure our ability to safely and effectively operate our business will be limited and any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss 

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of our vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of our business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets however we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our indebtedness 

references in this section to “us “we” or “our” shall mean diamondback energy inc and diamondback ep llc collectively unless otherwise specified 

we have relied in the past and we may rely from time to time in the future on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures unless we are able to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility with cash flow from operations and proceeds from equity or debt offerings implementing our capital programs may require an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances in addition a reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility and the inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures 

we have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures we expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings in the past we have created availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings we cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings instead we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding if the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 

restrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

certain of our debt instruments contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness make certain investments create liens sell or transfer assets issue preferred stock merge or consolidate with another entity pay dividends or make other distributions create unrestricted subsidiaries and engage in transactions with affiliates 

under our revolving credit facility we are allowed among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under our revolving credit facility we designated viper viper’s general partner viper’s subsidiary rattler rattler’s general partner and rattler’s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the revolving credit facility including the related guaranty further viper viper’s general partner viper’s subsidiaries rattler rattler’s general partner and rattler’s subsidiaries are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 

we and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments as an example our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio the requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument if default occurs under our revolving credit facility the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

our indebtedness is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries and our obligations are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries 

our senior indebtedness obligations are obligations exclusively of diamondback energy inc and diamondback ep llc and not of any of our other subsidiaries none of our other subsidiaries is a guarantor of our senior indebtedness any assets of those subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries and therefore the claims of our creditors including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims consequently our senior indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries other than diamondback ep llc and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish for additional information regarding our subsidiaries outstanding debt as of december 31 2021 see note 11— debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend or distribution payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so further the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries’ notes allow us to issue additional notes incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our viper llc’s and rattler llc’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate tied to libor libor tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts including general shortterm interest rates rates set by the us federal reserve which indicated plans for multiple interest rate increases in 2022 and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions from time to time we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed andor floating rate debt our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 167 during the year ended december 31 2021 viper llc’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 235 during the year ended december 31 2021 rattler llc’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 141 during the year ended december 31 2021 if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

on july 27 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor which we refer to as the fca announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 on march 5 2021 the ice benchmark administration which administers libor and the fca announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after 2021 for all nonus dollar libor settings and oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings and immediately after june 30 2023 for the remaining us dollar libor settings in light of these recent announcements the future of libor at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which libor is determined or regulatory activity related to libor’s phaseout could cause libor to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist our current credit agreement provides for any 

changes away from libor to a successor rate to be based on prevailing or equivalent standards however changes in the method of calculating libor or the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested permits any of our stockholders officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments and provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity transaction or other matter other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have i acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or ii acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including our quarterly or annual operating results changes in our earnings estimates investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry additions or departures of key personnel changes in the business earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts’ projections changes in industry general market or economic conditions and announcements of legislative or regulatory changes 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

the declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders 

on february 13 2018 we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018 the decision to pay any future dividends however is solely within the discretion of and subject to approval by our board of directors our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends including the record date the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination based on its evaluation of these factors the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders 

in september 2021 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 2 billion of our outstanding common stock of which 431 million had been repurchased through december 31 2021 the stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended modified or discontinued by the board of directors at any time 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes 

under section 382 of the code a corporation that experiences an “ownership change” as defined in the code may be subject to limitations on its ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses “nols” or tax credits generated prior to the ownership change in general an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in the ownership of a corporation’s stock totaling more than 50 percentage points by one or more “5 shareholders” as defined in the code at any time during a rolling threeyear period an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation’s prechange nols or tax credits that could be utilized to offset taxable income in any future taxable year the amount of the limitation is generally equal to the value of the corporation’s stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by an interest rate referred to as the longterm taxexempt rate periodically promulgated by the irs this limitation however may be significantly increased if there is “net unrealized builtin gain” in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change 

as of december 31 2021 we had an nol carryforward of approximately 25 billion and tax credits of 4 million for federal income tax purposes due to an ownership change on march 17 2021 in conjunction with our acquisition of qep in an allstock transaction our nols and tax credits including those acquired from qep are subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the code however we have determined that our fair market value and our net unrealized builtin gain position resulted in a significant increase in our section 382 limitation accordingly we believe that the application of section 382 as a result of this ownership change will not have an adverse effect on our ability to utilize our nols and credits 

future changes in our stock ownership however could result in an additional ownership change under section 382 of the code any such ownership change may limit our ability to offset taxable income arising after such an ownership change with nols or other tax attributes generated prior to such an ownership change possibly substantially 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent the ability of our board of directors to adopt amend or repeal bylaws and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 23 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 23 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors the requirement that 

the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 23 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

covid19 and effects on commodity prices 

in early march 2020 oil prices dropped sharply and continued to decline briefly reaching negative levels as a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets including i actions taken by opec members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and ii a significant decrease in demand due to the covid19 pandemic demand for oil and natural gas increased during 2021 as many restrictions on conducting business implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic were lifted due to improved treatments and availability of vaccinations in the us and globally as a result oil and natural gas market prices have improved during 2021 in response to the increase in demand during 2021 and 2020 the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil or nymex wti has ranged from 3763 to 8465 bbl and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas has ranged from 148 to 631 per mmbtu on january 18 2022 the closing nymex wti price for crude oil was 8543 per bbl and the closing nymex henry hub price of natural gas was 428 per mmbtu the emergence of the delta covid19 variant in the latter part of 2021 and the subsequent surge of the highly transmissible omicron variant however contributed to economic and pricing volatility as industry and market participants evaluated industry conditions and production outlook further on january 4 2021 opec and its nonopec allies known collectively as opec agreed to continue their program commenced in august of 2021 of gradual monthly output increases in february 2022 raising its output target by 400000 bbls per day which is expected to further boost oil supply in response to rising demand in its report issued on february 10 2022 opec noted its expectation that world oil demand will rise by 415 million bbls per day in 2022 as the global economy continues to post a strong recovery from the covid19 pandemic although this demand outlook is expected to underpin oil prices already seen at a sevenyear high in february 2022 we cannot predict any future volatility in commodity prices or demand for crude oil 

despite the recovery in commodity prices and rising demand we kept our production relatively flat during 2021 using excess cash flow for debt repayment andor return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program 

table of contents 

outlook 

during 2021 we continued building on our execution track record generating free cash flow while keeping capital costs under control and our efficiency gains particularly in the midland basin drilling and completion programs were able to mitigate certain inflationary pressures on well costs and led to a total capital expenditure amount of 15 billion down 11 from our guidance presented in april of 2021 we expect to continue to build on these operational efficiencies by controlling the variable portion of our operating and capital costs which we believe will help mitigate the inflationary pressures seen across our business we remain committed to capital discipline by maintaining flat oil production in 2022 and expect to maintain our bestinclass capital efficiency and cost structure we expect to be in a position to continue to deliver on the recently announced enhanced capital return program where we expect to distribute at least 50 of our quarterly free cash flow to our stockholders our capital return program is currently focused on our sustainable and growing dividend and a combination of stock repurchases and variable dividends we expect to remain flexible on returning capital to our stockholders depending on which method our board of directors believes presents the best return of capital to our stockholders at the relevant time 

in the midland basin we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within midland martin howard glasscock and andrews counties where development has primarily focused on drilling longlateral multiwell pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations 

in the delaware basin we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in pecos reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a which we believe has been derisked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target in 2022 we expect to focus development on these areas 

as of december 31 2021 we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 drilling rigs and between three and four completion crews in 2022 on average across our current acreage position in the midland and delaware basins 

environmental responsibility initiatives and highlights 

in february 2021 we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental social responsibility and governance or esg performance and disclosure including scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets our goals include the reduction of our scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50 and methane intensity by at least 70 in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels to further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality we have also implemented our “net zero now” initiative under which effective january 1 2021 we strive to produce every hydrocarbon molecule with zero scope 1 emissions to the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint we have purchased carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions we have also increased the weighting of esg metrics in our annual shortterm incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives to advance our environmental responsibility goals 

in september 2021 we announced our longterm goal to end routine flaring by 2025 and a longterm target to source over 65 of our water used for drilling and completion operations from recycled sources by 2025 with respect to flaring we flared 155 of our gross natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2021 for the full year ended 2021 we flared 145 of our gross natural gas production down 26 from 2020 

2022 capital budget 

we have currently budgeted 2022 total capital spend of 175 billion to 190 billion should commodity prices weaken we intend to act responsibly and consistent with our prior practices reduce capital spending if commodity prices strengthen we intend to maintain flat oil production pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders 

results of operations 

the following discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the results of operations between the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the midstream operations segment’s revenues and operating expenses were not significant to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 please refer to “part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 25 2021 which is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on form 10k 

table of contents 

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 



1 bbl equivalents are calculated using a conversion rate of six mcf per bbl 

2 hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives which we do not designate for hedge accounting hedged prices exclude gains or losses resulting from the early settlement of commodity derivative contracts 

production data 

substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids production the following tables provides information on the mix of our production for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



comparison of the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

oil natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues our revenues are a function of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes 

table of contents 

our oil natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues increased by approximately 40 billion or 145 to 67 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 from 28 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 higher average oil prices and to a lesser extent natural gas and natural gas liquids prices contributed 33 billion of the total increase the remainder of the overall change is due to a 25 increase in combined volumes sold 

higher commodity prices during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflect a recovery from historically low prices experienced in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic as discussed in “ — 2021 transactions and recent developments ” above the increase in production for 2021 compared to 2020 resulted primarily from the guidon acquisition and qep merger during the first quarter of 2021 and an overall recovery in our drilling and production activities after curtailments in the second quarter of 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we expect to hold our oil production levels flat during 2022 

lease operating expenses the following table shows lease operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



lease operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 140 million or 025 per boe primarily due to an increase in production between periods driven by the guidon acquisition and the qep merger in the first quarter of 2021 the increase on a per boe basis is primarily related to the williston basin assets acquired in the qep merger which had higher lease operating costs per boe on average than our historical properties we completed the divestiture of the williston basin properties in october 2021 

including the impact of our acquisition and divestiture activity in 2021 and future production plans our total lease operating expenses in 2022 are expected to range from approximately 539 million to 618 million 

production and ad valorem tax expense the following table shows production and ad valorem tax expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



in general production taxes are directly related to production revenues production taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 214 million or 132 per boe the increase in production taxes is attributable to an increase in commodity prices as well as an increase in overall production due to assets acquired in 2021 the current year increase on a per boe basis is primarily driven by an increase in current year commodity prices production taxes as a percentage of production revenues increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 due primarily to the acquired williston basin properties which have a higher production tax rate than our other properties we completed the divestiture of the williston basin properties in october 2021 

ad valorem taxes are based among other factors on property values driven by prior year commodity prices ad valorem taxes for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 16 million primarily due to additional properties acquired in the guidon acquisition and the qep merger 

we expect production taxes to be approximately between 7 and 8 of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids revenue during 2022

gathering and transportation expense the following table shows gathering and transportation expense for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



for the year ended december 31 2021 the increase for gathering and transportation expenses are primarily attributable to the increase in production between periods the current year increase on a per boe basis is primarily driven by production added from the assets acquired in the qep merger which in general had higher average gathering and transportation costs per boe than our historical properties particularly those qep assets located in the williston basin which we divested in the fourth quarter of 2021 after giving effect to the 2021 acquisition and divestiture activities we expect gathering and transportation expenses to range from approximately 212 to 243 million in 2022 

midstream services expense the following table shows midstream services expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities in the fourth quarter of 2021 we and rattler divested our natural gas gathering and transportation assets midstream services expense for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 16 million primarily due to decreased maintenance costs partially offset by increased fees for use of third party disposal systems 

depreciation depletion amortization and accretion the following table provides the components of our depreciation depletion and amortization expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



the decrease in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 40 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 resulted primarily from a reduction in the average depletion rate partially offset by increased production in 2021 the decline in rate resulted primarily from higher sec oil prices utilized in the reserve calculations during 2021 lengthening the economic life of the reserve base and resulting in higher projected remaining reserve volumes on our wells 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties no impairment expense was recorded for the year ended december 31 2021 in connection with the qep merger and the guidon acquisition we recorded the oil and natural gas properties acquired at fair value pursuant to sec guidance we determined the fair value of the properties acquired in the qep merger and the guidon acquisition clearly exceeded the related full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt as such we requested and received a waiver from the sec to exclude the acquired properties from the first quarter 2021 ceiling test calculation as a result no impairment expense related to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition was recorded for the three months ended march 31 2021 had we not received the waiver from the sec an impairment charge of approximately 11 billion would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2021 the properties acquired in the qep merger and the guidon acquisition had total unamortized costs at march 31 2021 of 30 billion and 11 billion respectively 

table of contents 

as a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020 we recorded noncash ceiling test impairments for the year ended december 31 2020 of 60 billion which is included in accumulated depletion depreciation amortization and impairment on our consolidated balance sheet impairment charges affect our results of operations but do not reduce our cash flow in addition to commodity prices our production rates levels of proved reserves future development costs transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods if the trailing 12month commodity prices fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters we may have material writedowns in subsequent quarters see note 8— p roperty and equipment for further details regarding factors that impact the impairment of oil and natural gas properties 

general and administrative expenses the following table shows general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 58 million primarily due to additional payroll and other employee driven costs of 32 million related to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition as well as 10 million of additional expense related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system additionally equity compensation for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 14 million compared to the same period in 2020 

we expect cash general and administrative expenses to range from approximately 87 million to 110 million in 2022 and noncash stockbased compensation to range from approximately 54 million to 69 million in 2022 

merger and integration expense the following table shows merger and integration expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



total merger and integration expense for the year ended december 31 2021 includes 69 million in costs incurred for the qep merger and 9 million in costs incurred for the guidon acquisition the qep merger related expenses primarily consist of 39 million in severance costs and 30 million in banking legal and advisory fees and the guidon acquisition related expenses consist primarily of advisory and legal fees see note 4— acquisitions and divestitures for further details regarding the qep merger and the guidon acquisition

net interest expense the following table shows net interest expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



net interest expense increased by 2 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this increase primarily consisted of i 47 million in interest costs on the newly issued march 2021 notes ii 25 million due to incurring a full year of interest expense in 2021 related to our may 2020 notes and rattler’s 5625 senior notes due 2025 and iii to a lesser extent interest expense incurred on the qep notes that remained outstanding following the qep merger completed in march 2021 these increases were partially offset by i 33 million in additional capitalized interest costs ii interest cost savings of 23 million on the repurchases of our 2025 senior notes in march 2021 and august 2021 iii 8 million on the repurchase of our 4625 senior notes of energen iv a 9 million reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit agreements during 2021 and v to a lesser extent interest savings on the repurchase of our 2023 notes in november 2021 we expect interest expense net of interest income to range from approximately 148 million to 178 million in 2022 see note 11— debt for further details regarding outstanding borrowings and interest expense 

derivative instruments the following table shows the net gain loss on derivative instruments and the net cash received paid on settlements of derivative instruments for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020

3 the year ended december 31 2021 includes cash received on interest rate swap contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of 80 million 

we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” as part of the qep merger we received by novation from qep certain derivative instruments which are included on our balance sheet as of december 31 2021 

we have designated certain of our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for accounting purposes as a result gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and no gain or loss is recognized due to hedge effectiveness changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the 2029 notes in the consolidated balance sheet beginning on december 1 2021 we began recording semiannual cash settlements of these interest rate swaps in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents 

at december 31 2021 we have a shortterm derivative asset of 13 million a longterm derivative asset of 4 million a shortterm derivative liability due in 2022 of 174 million and a longterm derivative liability due in 2023 of 29 million 

provision for benefit from income taxes the following table shows the provision for benefit from income taxes for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



the changes in our income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 were primarily due to the increase in pretax income for the year ended december 31 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of sources and uses of cash 

historically our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and sales of noncore assets our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties at december 31 2021 we had approximately 22 billion of liquidity consisting of 07 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 16 billion available under our credit facility as discussed below our capital budget for 2022 is 175 billion to 190 billion further we have 45 million of senior notes maturities in the next 12 months 

our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility we may draw on our revolving credit facility to meet shortterm cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longerterm liquidity and capital management program because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above we believe that our shortterm and longterm liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations but also our nearterm and longterm funding requirements including our capital spending programs dividend payments debt service obligations and repayment of debt maturities stock repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies 

future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties in order to mitigate this volatility we entered into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions all of which are participants in our credit facility hedging a portion of our estimated future crude oil and natural gas production through the end of 2023 as discussed further in note 15— derivatives and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—commodity price risk  the level of our hedging activity and duration of the financial instruments employed depend on our desired cash flow protection available hedge prices the magnitude of our capital program and our operating strategy 

as we pursue our business and financial strategy we regularly consider which capital resources including cash flow and equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us continued prolonged volatility in the capital financial andor credit markets due to the covid19 pandemic the depressed commodity markets andor adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to or increase our cost of capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all although the company expects that its sources of funding will be adequate to fund its shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all

cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are presented below 



operating activities 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see item 1a “risk factors” above 

the increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily resulted from i an increase of 40 billion in our total revenues and ii receipt of 152 million in refunds of income taxes receivable related to the carryback of federal net operating losses and the accelerated refund of minimum tax credits allowed under the cares act in 2020 these net cash inflows were partially offset by i a reduction of 15 billion due to making net cash payments of 12 billion on our derivative contracts in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to receiving net cash of 250 million on our derivative contracts in the year ended december 31 2020 ii an increase in our cash operating expenses of approximately 550 million primarily due to the qep merger and the guidon acquisition and iii other working capital changes primarily due to recording increases in accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued capital expenditure activity stemming from the qep merger and the guidon acquisition in 2021 see “ — results of operations ” for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 15 billion compared to 21 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the majority of our net cash used for investing activities during the year ended december 31 2021 was for the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets including the acquisition of certain leasehold interests as part of the guidon acquisition these expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our williston basin assets leasehold acreage and other gathering assets discussed in note 4— acquisitions and divestitures  

the majority of our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 was for drilling and completion costs in conjunction with our development program our capital expenditures for each period are discussed further below 

table of contents 

capital expenditure activities 

our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments on a cash basis were as follows for the specified period 



1 during the year ended december 31 2021 in conjunction with our development program we drilled 216 gross 203 net operated horizontal wells of which 175 gross 165 net wells were in the midland basin and 41 gross 38 net wells were in the delaware basin and turned 275 gross 258 net operated horizontal wells to production of which 207 gross 194 net were in the midland basin and 64 gross 61 net wells were in the delaware basin

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 18 billion compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 of 37 million during the year ended december 31 2021 the amount used in financing activities was primarily attributable to i 32 billion paid for the repurchase of outstanding principal on certain senior notes as discussed in “—repurchases of notes” below as well as 178 million of additional premiums paid in connection with the repurchases ii 525 million of repurchases as part of the share and unit repurchase programs iii 312 million of dividends paid to stockholders and iv 112 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest the cash outflows were partially offset by i 22 billion in proceeds from the march 2021 notes ii 313 million of borrowings under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities net of repayments and iii 22 million in net cash receipts from the early settlement of interest rate swaps and commodity derivative contracts that contained an otherthaninsignificant financing element 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily attributable to 348 million of repayments net of borrowings on our credit facilities 239 million in aggregate repayments on the energen notes and viper notes 236 million in dividends paid to stockholders 98 million of share repurchases as part of our stock repurchase program and 93 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest these cash outlays were partially offset by net proceeds of 997 million from the issuance of the may 2020 notes and the rattler notes during 2020 

capital resources 

revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments 

as of december 31 2021 our debt including the debt of viper and rattler consists of approximately 62 billion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior notes 499 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities and 58 million in outstanding amounts due under our drillco agreement 

at december 31 2021 we have total principal payments due on our outstanding senior notes including those of viper and rattler of 45 million in 2022 12 billion cumulatively in the years 2023 through 2024 21 billion cumulatively in the years 2025 and 2026 and 34 billion thereafter additionally we expect to incur future cash interest costs on these senior notes of approximately 177 million in 2022 371 million in the years from 2023 through 2024 277 million in the years from 2025 through 2026 and 961 million between 2027 and 2051 

on june 2 2021 we entered into a twelfth amendment or the amendment to the second amended and restated credit agreement which among other things decreased the total revolving loan commitments from 20 billion to 16 billion which may be increased in an amount up to 10 billion for a total maximum commitment amount of 26 billion upon election of the borrower subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 16 billion available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents 

viper’s revolving credit facility 

viper’s credit agreement as amended to date provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of 20 billion with a borrowing base of 580 million as of december 31 2021 based on the viper’s oil and natural gas reserves and other factors at december 31 2021 viper had elected a commitment amount of 500 million on its credit agreement with 304 million of outstanding borrowings during the year ended december 31 2021 the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the operating company’s revolving credit facility was 235 viper’s revolving credit facility matures in 2025 

rattler’s revolving credit facility 

rattler’s credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of 600 million which is expandable to 10 billion upon its election subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfaction of customary conditions as of december 31 2021 there was 195 million of outstanding borrowings under rattler’s revolving credit facility the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement was 141 for the year ended december 31 2021 rattler’s revolving credit facility matures in 2024 

during 2021 we issued an aggregate 22 billion of senior notes and redeemed 32 billion of senior notes outstanding 

for additional discussion of our outstanding debt as of december 31 2021 see note 11— debt  

subject to market conditions we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance our maturing debt the availability interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies among other factors 

we are currently in compliance and expect to continue to be with all financial maintenance covenants in our debt instruments 

debt ratings 

we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the us in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to commodity pricing levels our liquidity asset quality reserve mix debt levels cost structure planned asset sales and production growth opportunities our credit rating from standard and poor’s global ratings services is bbb our credit rating from fitch investor services is bbb our credit rating from moody’s investor services is baa3 any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements 

capital requirements 

in addition to future operating expenses and working capital commitments discussed in — results of operations  our primary short and longterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of i capital expenditures ii payments of other contractual obligations and iii cash commitments for dividends and share repurchases as discussed below 

based upon current oil and natural gas prices and production expectations for 2022 we believe that our cash flow from operations cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through the 12month period following the filing of this report and thereafter however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all further our 2022 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions 

table of contents 

2022 capital spending plan 

our board of directors approved a 2022 capital budget for drilling midstream and infrastructure of 175 billion to 190 billion maintaining our annualized fourth quarter 2021 cash capital expenditure guidance presented in november of 2021 we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

• 156 billion to 167 billion will be spent primarily on drilling 270 to 290 gross 248 to 267 net horizontal wells and completing 260 to 280 gross 240 to 258 net horizontal wells across our operated and nonoperated leasehold acreage in the northern midland and southern delaware basins with an average lateral length of approximately 10200 feet 

• 80 million to 100 million will be spent on midstream infrastructure excluding joint venture investments and 

• 110 million to 130 million will be spent on infrastructure and environmental expenditures excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions 

we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted 

the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners we were operating 10 drilling rigs and four completion crews at december 31 2021 and currently intend to operate between 10 and 12 rigs and between three and four completion crews on average in 2022 as we continue to execute on our strategy to hold oil production flat while using cash flow from operations to reduce debt strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our stockholders we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence and our capital expenditure budget up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions 

other contractual obligations and commitments 

at december 31 2021 our other significant contractual obligations consist primarily of i minimum transportation commitments totaling 878 million ii asset retirement obligations totaling 171 million and iii minimum purchase commitment for quantities of sand used in our drilling operations totaling 77 million we expect to make aggregate payments of approximately 105 million for these commitments during 2022 see note 9— asset retirement obligations and note 18— commitments and contingencies for further discussion of these and other contractual obligations and commitments 

dividends and share repurchases

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

oil and natural gas accounting and reserves 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting which is dependent on the estimation of proved reserves to determine the rate at which we record depletion on our oil and natural gas properties and whether the value of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties is permanently impaired based on the quarterly full cost ceiling impairment test further we utilize estimated proved reserves to assign fair value to acquired proved oil and natural gas properties including mineral and royalty interests as such we consider the estimation of proved reserves to be a critical accounting estimate 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and their associated future net cash flows the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data significant inputs included in the calculation of future net cash flows include our estimate of operating and development costs anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time and reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future depletion of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material revisions of previous reserve estimates accounted for approximately 719 million or 6 of the change in the standardized measure of our total reserves from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 no impairments were recorded on for our proved oil and gas properties during the year ended december 31 2021 however material impairments were recorded during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 as discussed further in note 8— property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report due to an increase in the historical 12month average trailing sec prices for oil and natural throughout 2021 and into 2022 we are not currently projecting a full cost ceiling impairment in the first quarter of 2022 

additionally costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant on an annual basis for possible impairment this assessment is subjective and includes consideration of the following factors among others intent of the operator to drill remaining lease term with the current operator geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned at december 31 2021 our unevaluated properties totaled 8 billion which consisted of 214151 net undeveloped leasehold acres with approximately 41855 net acres set to expire in 2022 we did not record any impairment on our unevaluated properties during the year ended december 31 2021 but any such future impairment could be material to our consolidated financial statements

commodity derivatives 

from time to time we use commodity derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas we exercise significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used the level of production volumes to include in our commodity derivative contracts the prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts and the counterparties’ creditworthiness we do not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and as a result mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations we are also required to recognize our derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or longterm based on their anticipated settlement dates the accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation and is generally determined using various inputs and assumptions including established index prices and other sources which are based upon among other things futures prices time to maturity implied volatilities and counterparty credit risk 

these fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions including any deferred premiums that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow marktomarket accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—commodity price risk for additional sensitivity analysis of our open derivative positions at december 31 2021 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting accordingly identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values 

we make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed fair value estimates are determined based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition utilizing expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant when marketobservable prices are not available to value assets and liabilities the company may use the cost income or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions 

the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties the assumptions made in performing these valuations include future production volumes future commodity prices and costs future operating and development activities projections of oil and gas reserves and a weighted average cost of capital rate the marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional projectspecific risking factors in addition when appropriate we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions and use that data as a proxy for fair market value for example the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties changes in key assumptions may cause the acquisition accounting to be revised including the recognition of additional goodwill or discount on acquisition there is no assurance the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation will occur as initially expected see note 4— acquisitions and divestitures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the qep merger and guidon acquisition including any significant changes in these estimates from the date of acquisition 

estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future in addition differences between the future commodity prices when acquiring assets and the historical 12month average trailing price to calculate ceiling test impairments of upstream assets may impact net earnings 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state and provincial tax jurisdictions we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit 

table of contents 

carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets including the assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required entails that we make estimates of and assumptions about future events including the pattern of reversal of taxable temporary differences and our future income from operations as of december 31 2021 we had established a total valuation allowance of 315 million including a valuation allowance for the full amount of viper’s deferred tax assets the valuation allowance remains in place based on the uncertainty of future events including viper’s ability to generate future taxable income in excess of special allocations to be made to diamondback and management considered this and other factors in evaluating the realizability of viper’s deferred tax assets no such valuation allowance was determined to be necessary against rattler’s deferred tax assets as of december 31 2021 based on the relative predictability of its future income stream based on its long term customer contracts any changes in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if viper’s or rattler’s deferred tax assets will be realized including projected future income could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements in addition the determination to record a valuation allowance on certain tax attributes acquired from qep and certain state nol carryforwards which the company does not believe are realizable prior to expiration was based on an evaluation of available positive and negative evidence including the annual limitation imposed by irc section 382 subsequent to an ownership change and the anticipated timing of reversal of the company’s deferred tax liabilities in the applicable jurisdictions as of december 31 2021 although the company’s recent cumulative losses represent negative evidence regarding reliance on future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences our balance of taxable temporary differences anticipated to reverse within the carryforward period provides significant positive evidence for the determination that our remaining deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized any change in the positive or negative evidence evaluated when determining if our deferred tax assets will be realized including projected future taxable income primarily related to the excess of book carrying value over tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties could result in a material change to our consolidated financial statements 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on uncertain tax positions and assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change at december 31 2021 our uncertain tax positions were insignificant however material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure in our exploration and production business is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years although demand and market prices for oil and natural gas have recently increased substantially due to rising energy use easing of the covid19 pandemic restrictions availability of treatments and vaccines in the us and globally and improvements in the us and global economic activity we cannot predict events that may lead to future commodity price volatility further the prices we receive for production depend on many other factors outside of our control 

we use derivatives including swaps basis swaps swaptions roll hedges costless collars puts and basis puts to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales 

table of contents 

at december 31 2021 we had a net liability derivative position of 168 million related to our commodity price derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our commodity price derivatives as of december 31 2021 a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net liability position by 149 million to 317 million while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have reduced the net liability derivative position by 117 million to 51 million however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

in our midstream operations business we have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause us or rattler’s other customers to delay drilling or shut in production which would reduce the volumes available for gathering and processing by our infrastructure assets if we or rattler’s other customers delay drilling or temporarily shut in production due to persistently low commodity prices or for any other reason our revenue in the midstream operations segment could decrease as rattler’s commercial agreements do not contain minimum volume commitments 

for additional information on our open commodity derivative instruments at december 31 2021 see note 15— derivatives  

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are due to the concentration of receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 598 million at december 31 2021 and to a lesser extent receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 72 million at december 31 2021 

we do not require our customers to post collateral and the failure or inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities and changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt the terms of our credit agreement provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 025 to 1125 per annum in the case of the alternative base rate and from 125 to 2125 per annum in the case of libor in each case based on the pricing level the pricing level depends on certain rating agencies’ ratings of our longterm senior unsecure debt we believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material nearterm impact on our future earnings or cash flows for additional information on our variable interest rate debt at december 31 2021 see note 11— debt  

historically we have at times used interest rate swaps and treasury locks to reduce our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of our fixedrate debt at december 31 2021 we have interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of 12 billion to manage the impact of market interest rates on the fair value of our fixedrate debt these interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of the company’s 12 billion 350 fixed rate senior notes due 2029 whereby we will receive the fixed rate of interest and will pay an average variable rate of interest based on three month libor plus 21865 for additional information on our interest rate swaps see note 15— derivatives

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators we report operations in two operating segments i the upstream segment and ii the midstream operations segment which includes midstream services and real estate operations

covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the global outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 as a “pandemic” to limit the spread of covid19 governments have taken various actions including the issuance of stayathome orders and social distancing guidelines causing some businesses to suspend operations and a reduction in demand for many products from direct or ultimate customers although many stayathome orders have expired and certain restrictions on conducting business have been lifted the covid19 pandemic resulted in a widespread health crisis and a swift and unprecedented reduction in international and us economic activity which in turn has adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas and caused significant volatility and disruption of the financial markets 

in early march 2020 oil prices dropped sharply and then continued to decline reaching negative levels during 2020 the average nymex wti futures contract price for crude oil and condensate was 3934 per barrel and the average henry hub futures contract price for natural gas was 213 per million british thermal units mmbtu representing decreases of 31 and 16 respectively from the comparable average futures prices during 2019 these decreases were the result of multiple factors affecting supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets including actions taken by opec members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and a significant decrease in demand due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic while opec members and certain other nations agreed in april 2020 to cut production and subsequently extended such production cuts through december 2020 which helped to reduce a portion of the excess supply in the market and improve crude oil prices they agreed to increase production by 500000 barrels per day beginning in january 2021 we cannot predict if or when commodity prices will stabilize and at what levels 

as a result of the reduction in crude oil demand caused by factors discussed above in 2020 we lowered our 2020 capital budget and production guidance curtailed near term production and reduced rig count all of which may be subject to further reductions or curtailment if the commodity markets and macroeconomic conditions worsen although we have restored curtailed production actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic and depressed commodity pricing environment have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial results and cash flows for additional details see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview ” 

given the dynamic nature of the events described above we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the ongoing covid19 pandemic the depressed commodity prices the reduced demand for oil and the adverse macroeconomic conditions will persist the full extent of the impact they will have on our industry and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows or the pace or extent of any subsequent recovery 

our business strategy 

our business strategy is to continue to profitably grow our business through the following 

• grow production and reserves by developing our oilrich resource base we intend to drill and develop our acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential through the conversion of our undeveloped reserves to developed reserves we will seek to increase our production reserves and cash flow while generating favorable returns on invested capital 

• leverage our experience operating in the permian basin our executive team which has an average of over 25 years of industry experience per person and significant experience in the permian basin intends to continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by refining and enhancing our drilling and completion techniques our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques is an important part of the continuous 

drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential drilling locations we believe that the experience of our executive team in deviated and horizontal drilling and completions has helped reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths in addition our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate and implement hydraulic fracturing practices that have and are expected to continue to increase recovery and reduce completion costs our executive team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance against the best performing operators and evaluate and adopt best practices 

• enhance returns through our low cost development strategy and focus on continuous improvement in operational capital allocation and cost efficiencies our acreage position is generally in contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities we are the operator of approximately 98 of our acreage this operational control allows us to manage more efficiently the pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical applications including horizontal development our average 84 working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies 

• pursue strategic acquisitions with substantial resource potential we have a proven history of acquiring leasehold positions in the permian basin that have substantial oilweighted resource potential our executive team with its extensive experience in the permian basin has what we believe is a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to evaluate resource potential most recently in december 2020 we entered into the merger agreement with qep to acquire qep in an allstock transaction valued at approximately 22 billion including qep’s net debt of 16 billion as of september 30 2020 the pending merger upon closing will add material tier1 midland basin inventory in december 2020 we also entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with guidon and certain of guidon’s affiliates to acquire approximately 32500 net acres in the northern midland basin and certain related oil and natural gas assets we regularly review acquisition opportunities and intend to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets 

• maintain financial flexibility we seek to maintain a conservative financial position as of december 31 2020 our borrowing base was set at 20 billion and we had 198 billion available for borrowing as of december 31 2020 viper llc had 84 million in outstanding borrowings and 496 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 rattler llc had 79 million in outstanding borrowings and 521 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility 

our strengths 

we believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals 

• oil rich resource base in one of north america’s leading resource plays all of our leasehold acreage is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in north america the permian basin in west texas the majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the permian basin our production for the year ended december 31 2020 was approximately 60 oil 20 natural gas liquids and 20 natural gas as of december 31 2020 our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 58 oil 22 natural gas liquids and 20 natural gas 

• multiyear drilling inventory in one of north america’s leading oil resource plays we have identified a multiyear inventory of potential drilling locations for our oilweighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities at an assumed price of approximately 6000 per bbl wti we currently have approximately 10413 gross 6863 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations on our acreage based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data these gross identified economic potential horizontal locations have an average lateral length of approximately 8200 feet with the actual length depending on lease geometry and other considerations these locations exist across most of our acreage blocks and in multiple horizons the ultimate interwell spacing may vary from these distances due to different factors which would result in a higher or lower location count in addition we have approximately 3610 square miles of proprietary 3d seismic data covering our acreage this data facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity including additional horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions 

• experienced incentivized and proven management team our executive team has a proven track record of executing on multirig development drilling programs and extensive experience in the permian basin in addition our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing horizontal wells in addition to horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise which is of strategic importance as we expand our horizontal drilling activity 

• favorable operating environment we have focused our drilling and development operations in the permian basin one of the longest operating hydrocarbon basins in the united states with a long and wellestablished production history and developed infrastructure we believe that the geological and regulatory environment of the permian basin is more stable and predictable and that we are faced with less operational risks in the permian basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins 

• high degree of operational control we are the operator of approximately 98 of our permian basin acreage this operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes additionally as the operator of substantially all of our acreage we retain the ability to increase or decrease our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks this operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects 

• access to midstream infrastructure and gathering and transportation pipelines  through our publicly traded subsidiary rattler we have secured access to midstream infrastructure and crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines tailored to our expected production growth ramp in order to allow us the operational flexibility to execute on our growth plan rattler is the primary provider of midstream services to us with an acreage dedication that spans a total of approximately 395000 gross acres across all of rattler’s service lines and over the core of the midland and delaware basins 

our properties 

location and land 

the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states as of december 31 2020 our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 449642 gross 378678 net acres which consisted primarily of approximately 215956 gross 194591 net acres in the midland basin and approximately 192697 gross 152587 net acres in the delaware basin we are the operator of approximately 98 of this permian basin acreage in addition our publicly traded subsidiary viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 787264 gross acres and 24350 net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale approximately 52 of these net royalty acres are operated by us 

we have been developing multiple pay intervals in the permian basin through horizontal drilling and believe that there are opportunities to target additional intervals throughout the stratigraphic column we believe our significant experience drilling completing and operating horizontal wells will allow us to efficiently develop our remaining inventory and ultimately target other horizons that have limited development to date the following table presents horizontal producing wells in which we have a working interest in as of december 31 2020 



1 of these 2380 total horizontal producing wells we are the operator of 1694 wells and have a nonoperated working interest in 686 additional wells 

the following table presents the average number of days in which we were able to drill our horizontal wells to total depth specified below during the year ended december 31 2020 



further advances in drilling and completion technology may result in economic development of zones that are not currently viable 

further our subsidiary rattler is focused on ownership operation development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the midland and delaware basins of the permian basin as of december 31 2020 rattler owned and operated 927 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines natural gas gathering pipelines and a fully integrated water system on acreage that overlays our seven core midland and delaware basin development areas to facilitate the transportation of water and hydrocarbon volumes away from the producing wellhead to ensuring the efficient operations of a crude oil or natural gas well rattler’s midstream infrastructure includes a network of gathering pipelines that collect and transport crude oil natural gas and produced water from our operations in the midland and delaware basins

rattler also owns and operates certain real estate assets in midland texas including the fasken center which has over 421000 net rentable square feet within its two office towers 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry bone spring wolfcamp strawn atoka and barnett formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations which we collectively refer to as the wolfberry play since then we and most other operators are almost exclusively drilling horizontal wells in the development of unconventional reservoirs in the permian basin as of december 31 2020 we held working interests in 4326 gross 3401 net producing wells and only royalty interests in 4553 additional wells 

geology 

the greater permian basin formed as an area of rapid pennsylvanianpermian subsidence in response to dynamic structural influence of the marathon uplift and ancestral rockies it is one of the most productive sedimentary basins in the us with established oil and natural gas production from several stacked reservoirs of varying age ranges most notably permian aged sediments in particular the permian aged wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring formations have been heavily targeted for several decades first through vertical comingling of these zones and more recently through horizontal exploitation of each individual horizon prior to deposition of the wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring formations the area of the presentday permian basin was a continuous sedimentary feature called the tabosa basin during this time ordovician silurian devonian and mississippian sediments were laid down in a primarily open marine shelf setting however some time frames saw more restrictive settings that were conducive to the deposition of organically rich mudstone such as the devonian woodford and mississippian barnettmeramec these formations are important sources and more recently reservoirs within the presentday greater permian basin 

the spraberry and bone spring formations were deposited as siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites and debris flows along with pelagic mudstones in a deepwater basinal environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow grainflow and finegrained pelagic sediments which were also deposited in a basinal setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring are generally found in close proximity to the central basin platform while mudstone reservoirs thicken basinward away from the central basin platform the mudstone within these reservoirs is organically rich which when buried to sufficient depth for thermal maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the mudstones themselves and in the interbedded conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs due to this complexity the wolfcamp spraberry and bone spring intervals are a hybrid reservoir system that contains characteristics of both unconventional and conventional reservoirs 

we have successfully developed several hybrid reservoir intervals within the clearfork spraberrybone spring wolfcamp and barnettmeramec formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the mudstones and some clastics exhibit low permeabilities which necessitate the need for hydraulic fracture stimulation to unlock the vast storage of hydrocarbons in these targets 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 3610 square miles of 3d data this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling program and identification of additional resources to be exploited 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2020 net production from our acreage was 109921 mboe or an average of 300331 boed of which approximately 60 was oil 20 was natural gas liquids and 20 was natural gas 

  

recent and future activity 

during 2021 we expect to complete an estimated 215 to 235 gross 197 to 215 net operated horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2021 for drilling and infrastructure will be between 14 billion and 16 billion consisting of 12 billion to 14 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity 60 million to 80 million for midstream investments excluding joint venture investments and 70 million to 90 million will be spent on infrastructure and other expenditures excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2020 we drilled 208 gross 195 net and completed 171 gross 159 net operated horizontal wells during the year ended december 31 2020 our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells were 16 billion in addition we spent 248 million for oil and natural gas midstream and infrastructure 

we were operating eight drilling rigs at december 31 2020 and currently intend to operate between eight and 12 rigs on average in 2021 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data we currently have approximately 10413 gross 6863 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately 6000 per bbl wti with our current development plan we expect to continue our strong pud conversion ratio in 2021 by converting an estimated 30 of our puds to a proved developed category and developing approximately 80 of the consolidated 2020 yearend pud reserves by the end of 2023 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2020 were estimated using a deterministic method 

the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves approximately 90 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 10 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

the process of estimating oil natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves is complex and requires significant judgment as discussed in “ item 1a risk factors ” of this report as a result we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical 

information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and natural gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

our executive vice president–chief engineer is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all our reserve estimates our executive vice president–chief engineer is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 20 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and natural gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates is completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

• review and verification of historical production data which data is based on actual production as reported by us 

• preparation of reserve estimates by our executive vice president–chief engineer or under his direct supervision 

• review by our executive vice president–chief engineer of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions 

• direct reporting responsibilities by our executive vice president–chief engineer to our chief executive officer 

• verification of property ownership by our land department and 

• no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked 

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states as of december 31 2020 none of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 



1 estimates of reserves as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in accordance with sec guidelines reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties all of which are located within the continental united states although we believe these estimates are reasonable actual future production cash flows taxes development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates see “ item 1a risk factors ” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with our estimates of proved reserves and related factors and see note 20— supplemental information on oil and natural gas operations for further discussion of our reserve estimates and pricing 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2020 our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 315937 mbbls of oil 522029 mmcf of natural gas and 96701 mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 499643 mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2020 mboe 



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 220023 mboe from 277 gross 236 net wells in which we have a working interest and 15686 mboe from 299 gross wells in which viper owns royalty interests of the 277 gross working interest wells 98 were in the delaware basin transfers of 89133 mboe from undeveloped to developed reserves were the result of drilling or participating in 102 gross 94 net horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 82 gross wells in which we have a royalty interest or mineral interest through viper we own a working interest in 78 of the 82 gross viper wells downward revisions of 15742 mboe were the result of i negative revisions of 4226 mboe due to lower product pricing which were partially offset by positive revisions of 1494 mboe associated with a reduction in lease operating expenses resulting in a total negative pricing revision of 2732 mboe and ii pud downgrades of 26329 mboe are primarily from changes in the corporate development plan these negative revisions were offset with positive revisions of 13319 mboe associated with less gas flaring and a corresponding increase in shrunk gas and natural gas liquid recoveries 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 381 million during 2020 estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 676 million in 2021 764 million in 2022 859 million in 2023 and 531 million in 2024 since our formation in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced and we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

as of december 31 2020 all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded 

we have identified a multiyear inventory of potential drilling locations for our oilweighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and return opportunities at an assumed price of approximately 6000 per bbl wti we currently have approximately 10413 gross 6863 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations on our acreage based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data the following table presents the number of identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations by basin 



1 our current location count is based on 660 foot to 880 foot spacing in midland martin northeast andrews howard and glasscock counties depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties 

2 our current location count is based on 660 foot spacing in midland martin and northeast andrews counties depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties 

3 our current location count is based on 660 foot to 880 foot spacing in midland martin northeast andrews howard and glasscock counties depending on the prospect area and 880 foot spacing in all other counties 

4 our current location count is based on 880 foot to 1320 foot spacing

wells drilled and completed in 2020 

the following table sets forth the total number of operated horizontal wells drilled and completed during the year ended december 31 2020 



as of december 31 2020 we operated the following wells 



productive wells 

as of december 31 2020 we owned an average unweighted 79 working interest in 4326 gross 3401 net productive wells and an average 18 royalty interest in 4553 additional wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average 38 net revenue interest in 7167 gross productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

the following table sets forth information regarding productive wells by basin as of december 31 2020 



drilling results 

the following tables set forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated by basin each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 







as of december 31 2020 we had 20 gross 19 net operated wells in the process of drilling and 151 gross 141 net in the process of completion or waiting on completion 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2020 relating to our leasehold acreage 



1 does not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease large portions of the acreage that are considered developed under sec guidelines are developed with vertical wells or horizontal wells that are in a single horizon we believe much of this acreage has significant remaining development potential in one or more intervals with horizontal wells 

2 does not include viper’s mineral interests but does include leasehold acres that we own underlying our mineral interests 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

as of december 31 2020 the following gross and net undeveloped acres are set to expire over the next four years based on their contractual lease maturities unless i production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or ii the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the contractual expiration dates 



title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2020 four purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue we do not require collateral and do not believe the loss of any single purchaser would materially impact our operating results as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers for additional information regarding our customer concentrations see note 3— revenue from contracts with customers included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

delivery commitments 

certain of our firm sales agreements for oil include delivery commitments that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity we believe our current production and reserves are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments and we expect such reserves will continue to be the primary means of fulfilling our future commitments however these contracts provide the options of delivering thirdparty volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment for additional information regarding commitments see note 17— commitments and contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and in our upstream segment we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

in our midstream operations segment as rattler seeks to expand its crude oil natural gas and waterrelated midstream services it faces a high level of competition including major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather compress treat process transport store or market oil and natural gas as rattler seeks to expand to provide midstream services to third party producers it similarly faces a high level of competition competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids within the acreage dedicated by rattler to us rattler does not compete with other midstream companies to provide us with midstream services as a result of our relationship and longterm dedications to rattler’s midstream assets however we may continue to use third party service providers for certain midstream services within such dedicated acreage until the expiration or termination of certain preexisting dedications 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production in the midland and delaware basins are transported to purchasers by pipeline 

the following table presents the average percentage of produced oil sold by pipeline and the average percentage of produced water connected to saltwater disposals by pipeline 



we have entered into multiple feebased commercial agreements with rattler each with an initial term ending in 2034 utilizing rattler’s infrastructure assets or its planned infrastructure assets to provide an array of essential services critical to our upstream operations in the delaware and midland basins our agreements with rattler include a total of approximately 395000 gross acres across all rattler’s service lines across the midland and delaware basins 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 125 to 300 resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 700 to 875 

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations in our exploration and production business seasonal weather conditions such as for example the recent severe winter storms in the permian basin and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations in our midstream operations business the volumes of condensate produced at rattler’s processing facilities fluctuate seasonally with volumes generally increasing in the winter months and decreasing in the summer months as a result of the physical properties of natural gas and comingled liquids severe or prolonged summers may adversely affect our results of operations in the midstream operations segment

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is often strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling the resource conservation and recovery act or the rcra as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the rcra sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the rcra such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or 

categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” also in december 2016 the epa agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and natural gas waste however in april 2019 the epa concluded that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of oil and natural gas waste are not necessary at this time any changes in such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released 

water discharges the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” or the cwa the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act or the opa and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak the cwa and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 

on june 29 2015 the epa and the us army corps of engineers or the corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the cwa however on october 22 2019 the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 rules the 2015 rule and the 2019 repeal are subject to several ongoing legal challenges also on april 21 2020 the epa and the corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the cwa as a result of such recent developments substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the cwa several state and environmental groups have challenged the replacement rule and on january 20 2021 the biden administration directed the epa and the corps to review the rule to the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the cwa’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas 

the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 

the opa is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 

noncompliance with the cwa or the opa may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions the federal clean air act or the caa as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal caa that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which are discussed in more detail below in “—regulation of hydraulic fracturing” also on may 12 2016 the epa issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal caa and associated state laws and regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 

climate change in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs in addition states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and natural gas operations for example on november 4 2020 the texas railroad commission adopted new guidance on when flaring is permissible requiring operators to submit more specific information to justify the need to flare or vent gas 

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions although the united states withdrew from the paris agreement effective november 4 2020 president biden issued an executive order on january 20 2021 to rejoin the paris agreement which went into effect on february 19 2021 the united states has indicated its plan to announce in advance of an april 22 2021 climate summit its nationally determined contribution or its commitment to reduce its national greenhouse gas emissions to meet this objective furthermore many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the commitments set forth in the international accord 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any 

such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

moreover climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions such as for example the recent severe winter storms in the permian basin can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal caa that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration in particular on may 12 2016 the epa amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new modified and reconstructed equipment processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector however in a march 28 2017 executive order the trump administration directed the epa to review the 2016 regulations and if appropriate to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production accordingly on august 13 2020 the epa issued final amendments to the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards to ease regulatory burdens including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether various state municipal and environmental groups have challenged the amendments and on january 20 2021 president biden issued an executive order directing the epa to review the amendments consistent with several policy objective including reducing greenhouse gas emissions thus substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of the new source performance standards for oil and natural gas operations the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards to the extent implemented as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 

several states including texas and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas legislature adopted legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and natural gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal state or local level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to permitting delays and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

endangered species 

the federal endangered species act or esa and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitats if endangered species are located in areas where we operate our operations or any work performed related to them could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in compliance with the esa on august 12 2019 the us fish and wildlife service and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration’s national marine fisheries service jointly published final rules that among other things tighten the critical habitat designation process and eliminate certain automatic protections for threatened species going forward nevertheless the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production 

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 

drilling and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the timing of construction or drilling activities including seasonal wildlife closures the rates of production or “allowables” the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled the plugging and abandoning of wells and notice to and consultation with surface owners and other third parties 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate although the corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 

natural gas sales and transportation historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services are provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations 

natural gas gathering although ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the facilities rattler llc considers to be natural gas gathering pipelines rattler believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that ferc has used to determine that pipelines perform primarily a gathering function and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated interstate transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress if ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of 1938 or nga and that the facility provides interstate transportation service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by ferc under the nga or the natural gas policy act or ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question adversely affect results of operations and cash flow in addition if any of the facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by ferc 

even though rattler llc considers its natural gas gathering pipelines to be exempt from the jurisdiction of ferc under the nga ferc regulation of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines may indirectly impact gathering services ferc’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets and gathering services in recent years ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines however there can be no assurance that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the natural gas gathering services 

natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore rattler llc’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on rattler’s or our operations but additional capital expenditures and increased operating costs may result depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

oil sales and transportation sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future 

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and our subsidiary rattler llc has a tariff on file with ferc to perform gathering service in interstate commerce intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines including our subsidiary rattler llc must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 

safety and maintenance regulation in our midstream operations rattler llc is subject to regulation by the us department of transportation or dot under the hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of 1979 or hlpsa and comparable state statutes with respect to design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline facilities hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products including natural gas liquids and condensate and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the united states secretary of transportation these regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these hlpsa regulations 

rattler llc is also subject to the natural gas pipeline safety act of 1968 or ngpsa and the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 the ngpsa regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities while the pipeline safety improvement act establishes mandatory inspections for all united states crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering pipelines in highconsequence areas within ten years dot through the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration or phmsa has developed regulations implementing the pipeline safety improvement act that requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other safety protections in areas where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property 

the pipeline safety and job creation act enacted in 2011 and the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 also known as the pipes act enacted in 2016 amended the hlpsa and ngpsa and increased safety regulation the pipeline safety and job creation act doubles the maximum administrative fines for safety violations from 100000 to 200000 for a single violation and from 10 million to 20 million for a related series of violations now increased for inflation to 218647 and 2186465 respectively and provides that these maximum penalty caps do not apply to civil enforcement actions establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines including the expansion of integrity management use of automatic and remotecontrolled shutoff valves leak detection systems sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines use of excess flow valves verification of maximum allowable operating pressure incident notification and other pipelinesafety related requirements the pipes act ensures that the phmsa completes the pipeline safety and job creation act requirements reforms phmsa to be a more dynamic datadriven regulator and closes gaps in federal standards 

phmsa has undertaken rulemakings to address many areas of this legislation for example on october 1 2019 phmsa published final rules to expand its integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on regulated pipelines including certain segments outside high consequence areas the rules once effective also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated gathering lines the safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the pipeline safety and job creation act and the pipes act as well as any implementation of phmsa rules thereunder andor related rule making proceedings could require us to install new or modified safety controls pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in addition any material penalties or fines issued to us under these or other statutes rules regulations or orders could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards and many states have undertaken responsibility to enforce the federal standards the railroad commission of texas is the agency vested with intrastate natural gas pipeline regulatory and enforcement authority in texas the commission’s regulations adopt by reference the minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of natural gas in addition on december 17 2019 the commission adopted rules requiring that operators of gathering lines take appropriate actions to fix safety hazards we do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable federal and state laws and regulations in texas our gathering pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements 

in addition we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act or osha and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers moreover the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens rattler llc and the entities in which it owns an interest are also subject to osha process safety management regulations which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic reactive flammable or explosive chemicals these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas pressurized tanks caverns and wells in excess of 10000 pounds at various locations flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt from these standards also the department of homeland security and other agencies such as the epa continue to develop regulations concerning the security of industrial facilities including crude oil and natural gas facilities we are subject to a number of requirements and must prepare federal response plans to comply we must also prepare risk management plans under the regulations promulgated by the epa to implement the requirements under the caa to prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances we have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with safeguard and security requirements we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety and security 

state regulation texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our 

financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our thirdparty vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

human capital 

we have developed a culture grounded upon the solid foundation of our core values—leadership integrity excellence people and teamwork—that are adhered to throughout our company we set a high bar for all of our employees in terms of how they operate and interact both within the office and out in the field we challenge them to identify new ways to foster a better future for themselves and for us 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 732 full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also utilize independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our fulltime employees 

diversity and inclusion 

equal employment opportunity is one of our core tenets and as such our employment decisions are based on merit qualifications competencies and contributions we actively seek to attract and retain an increasingly diverse workforce and continue to cultivate an inclusive and respectful work environment we deeply value the perspectives and experiences from our diverse team and are proud of our team rich in a range of ethnic cultural and ideological backgrounds nearly a third of our employees are women and 25 selfidentify as ethnic minorities we have taken various actions during 2020 to increase the diversity in our candidate pool and broaden our outreach particularly within our intern program through various student organizations to support this inclusion effort 

health and safety 

protecting employees the public and the environment is a top priority in our operations and in the way we manage our assets we are focused on minimizing the risk of workplace incidents and preparing for emergencies as an indelible element of our corporate responsibility we also strive to comply with all applicable health safety and environmental standards laws and regulations 

through a unified orientation initiative called basin united we and other oil and natural gas operators have committed to reduce injuries and fatalities in our industry we are aligning our employees and independent contractors around the international association of oil  gas producers life saving rules safety culture improvements safety leadership actions and human performance principles we also involve employees from all operational levels on our safety committee which provides suggested improvements to the overall safety program recommended preventative measures based on reviewing vehicle and personnel incidents safety and environmental audits at operational locations and audit and oversight of the diamondback hazard communication program in accordance with osha regulations 

from 2016 through 2020 we had zero employee workrelated fatalities our employee osha recordable cases comprising workrelated injuries and illnesses that require medical treatment beyond first aid totaled three in 2020 flat from three in 2019 our employee total recordable incident rate trir in 2020 was flat from 2019 and losttime incident rate ltir decreased in 2020 we have set a shortterm target of maintaining an employee trir of 05 or less 

training and development 

we support employees in pursuing training opportunities to expand their professional skills our internal course offerings in 2020 included a wide array of topics such as excel power lunch performance management covid19 safety training as well as various and extensive safety and other compliance training sessions in 2020 our team completed nearly 8000 hours of training additionally our people also undergo training and education each year on regulatory compliance industry standards and innovative opportunities to effectively manage the challenges of developing our resources

 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business and properties” item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks relating to the pending merger 

the pending merger may not be completed and the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms failure to complete the pending merger could negatively impact the price of shares of our common stock and our future businesses and financial results 

the pending merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied including the approval by qep stockholders of the merger agreement proposal or to the extent permitted by applicable law waived in each case prior to the completion of the pending merger the conditions to the completion of the pending merger some of which are beyond our control may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the pending merger may be delayed or may not be completed 

in addition if the pending merger is not completed by june 30 2021 or in certain instances on or before september 30 2021 either we or qep may choose not to proceed with the pending merger by terminating the merger agreement and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time before or after stockholder approval further either we or qep may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances specified in the merger agreement if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed for any reason our ongoing business financial condition and financial results may be adversely affected without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

• we may be required to pay our costs relating to the transactions which are substantial such as legal accounting financial advisory and printing fees whether or not the transactions are completed 

• time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities 

• we may experience negative reactions from financial markets including negative impacts on the price of our common stock including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the transactions will be completed 

• we may experience negative reactions from employees customers or vendors and 

• since the merger agreement restricts the conduct of our business prior to completion of the pending merger we may not have been able to take certain actions during the pendency of the merger that would have benefitted us as an independent company and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available 

we will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending which could adversely affect our business 

uncertainty about the effect of the pending merger on employees industry contacts and business partners may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the pending merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter and could cause industry contacts business partners and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us in addition the merger agreement restricts the parties to the merger agreement from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of the other party these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the pending merger 

we will incur significant transaction and mergerrelated costs in connection with the pending merger which may be in excess of those anticipated by us 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with negotiating and completing the pending merger combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies these fees and costs have been and will continue to be substantial the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the pending merger and include among others employee retention costs fees paid to financial legal and accounting advisors severance and benefit costs and filing fees 

we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to the integration of the companies which may be substantial moreover we may incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with the pending merger and the integration including costs associated with any stockholder litigation related to the pending merger although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all the costs described above as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of the combined company following the completion of the pending merger 

we and our subsidiaries will have substantial indebtedness after giving effect to the pending merger which may limit our financial flexibility and adversely affect our financial results 

under the merger agreement qep’s outstanding debt other than its existing credit facility will remain outstanding which debt as of december 31 2020 was approximately 16 billion and consisted of amounts outstanding under qep’s senior notes as of december 31 2020 we had total longterm debt of approximately 56 billion consisting primarily of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility our senior unsecured notes the notes issued by our subsidiary energen corporation the senior notes issued by our publicly traded subsidiaries viper and rattler and the amounts outstanding under viper’s and rattler’s revolving credit facilities 

our pro forma indebtedness as of december 31 2020 assuming consummation of the pending merger had occurred on such date and qep’s senior notes remain outstanding would have been approximately 74 billion representing an increase in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis we believe that postmerger we will retain our investment grade credit ratings and retire the combined company’s pro forma debt at a faster rate than either company would have been able to do absent the pending merger however any increase in our indebtedness could have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations including 

• increasing difficulty to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt obligations including any repurchase obligations that may arise thereunder 

• diverting a significant portion of our cash flows to service our indebtedness which could reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that we would be unable to pursue due to our indebtedness 

• limiting our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms 

• impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes and 

• increasing our vulnerability to interest rate increases as our borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable interest rates 

we believe that the combined company will have flexibility to repay refinance repurchase redeem exchange or otherwise terminate large portions of our outstanding debt obligations however there can be no guarantee that we would be able to execute such refinancings on favorable terms or at all and a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations including from the debt obligations of qep our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance our future performance depends on many factors independent of the pending merger some of which are beyond our control such as general economic conditions and oil and natural gas prices we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt 

lawsuits have been filed against qep us merger sub and the members of the qep board in connection with the merger and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the merger andor substantial costs to us and qep 

securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition merger or other business combination agreements like the merger agreement even if such a lawsuit is without merit defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources 

as of february 22 2021 nine individual lawsuits have been filed by purported qep stockholders in united states district courts in connection with the proposed merger all nine lawsuits name qep and the members of the qep board as defendants and two of the nine lawsuits name us and merger sub as defendants the complaints allege among other things that the registration statements relating to the merger on form s4 filed by us on january 22 2021 as amended on form s4a filed on february 3 2021 and the schedule 14a definitive proxy statement filed by qep on february 10 2021 fail to provide certain allegedly material information concerning the proposed merger in violation of sections 14a and 20a of the exchange act and rule 14a9 promulgated thereunder in addition to these allegations some of the complaints allege that the merger consideration to be received by the qep stockholders in the merger is unfair because the value of the qep common 

stock is in excess of the value of the merger consideration that the no solicitation clause in the merger agreement is improper and that the termination fee contemplated by the merger agreement is excessive some of the complaints also assert a breach of fiduciary duty claim under state law against individual qep board members among other remedies the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the completion of the proposed merger a recission of the completed merger or rescissory damages an accounting of damages suffered by the plaintiff an award of plaintiff’s expenses and attorney’s fees and other relief 

each of us and qep believes that the allegations in the complaints are without merit additional lawsuits arising out of the merger may also be filed in the future 

one of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no injunction by any governmental entity having jurisdiction over us qep or merger sub has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted in either case that prohibits the closing of the merger consequently if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the merger that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all which may adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

additionally there can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of the lawsuits filed thus far or any potential future lawsuits the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risk factors relating to diamondback following the completion of the pending merger 

the integration of qep into our business may not be as successful as anticipated and we may not achieve the intended benefits or do so within the intended timeframe 

the pending merger involves numerous operational strategic financial accounting legal tax and other risks potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses and uncertainties related to design operation and integration of qep’s internal control over financial reporting difficulties in integrating qep into our business may result in us performing differently than expected operational challenges or the failure to realize anticipated expenserelated efficiencies potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include among others 

• the inability to successfully integrate qep into our business in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the pending merger 

• complexities associated with managing the larger more complex integrated business 

• not realizing anticipated operating synergies 

• integrating personnel from the two companies and the loss of key employees 

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses delays or regulatory conditions associated with the pending merger 

• integrating relationships with industry contacts and business partners 

• performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the pending merger and integrating qep’s operations into our operations and 

• the disruption of or the loss of momentum in ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies 

additionally the success of the pending merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and qep’s businesses including operational and other synergies that we believe the combined company will achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the pending merger may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee 

our results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the pending merger 

the success of the pending merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and qep’s businesses including the need to integrate the operations and business of qep into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers vendors industry contacts and business partners 

the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the pending merger may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee some of the assumptions that we have made such as the achievement of operating synergies may not be realized there could also be unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the pending merger that were not discovered in the due diligence review conducted by each company prior to entering into the merger agreement 

the pending merger may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

because shares of our common stock will be issued in the pending merger it is possible that although we currently expect the merger to be accretive to earnings per share the merger may be dilutive to our earnings per share which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

in connection with the completion of the pending merger based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of qep common stock as of february 22 2021 and the number of outstanding qep equity awards currently estimated to be payable in our common stock following the merger we will issue up to approximately 124 million shares of our common stock the issuance of these new shares of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common stock through dilution of earnings per share or otherwise any dilution of or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or increase at a reduced rate 

furthermore our current stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in the additional operations of the combined company or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their interests in the combined company and as a result may seek to sell their shares of our common stock following or in anticipation of completion of the pending merger the merger agreement does not restrict the ability of former qep stockholders to sell such shares of our common stock following completion of the pending merger therefore these sales or the perception that these sales may occur coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock may affect the market for and the market price of our common stock in an adverse manner 

if the pending merger is completed and our stockholders including former qep stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following the consummation of the pending merger the market price of our common stock may decrease these sales might also make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equityrelated securities at a time and price that it otherwise would deem appropriate 

the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate after the pending merger and may decline if the benefits of the pending merger do not meet the expectations of financial analysts 

upon completion of the pending merger holders of qep common stock who receive merger consideration will become holders of shares of our common stock the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly following completion of the pending merger and holders of qep common stock could lose some or all of the value of their investment in our common stock in addition the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which could if such fluctuations continue to occur have a material adverse effect on the market for or liquidity of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 

the market price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected qep common stock or our common stock 

our business differs from that of qep in certain respects and accordingly our financial position or results of operations andor cash flows after the pending merger is completed as well as the market price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our financial position or results of operations andor cash flows as an independent standalone company 

following the completion of the pending merger we may incorporate qep’s hedging activities into our business and as a result may be exposed to additional commodity price risks arising from such hedges 

to mitigate its exposure to changes in commodity prices qep hedges oil and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments if we assume qep’s existing derivative instruments or if qep enters into additional derivative instruments prior to the completion of the pending merger we will bear the economic impact of the contracts following the completion of the pending merger actual crude oil and natural gas prices may differ from the combined company’s expectations and as a result such derivative instruments may have a negative impact on our business 

the combined company may record goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material noncash charges to the results of operations of the combined company in the future 

the pending merger will be accounted for as an acquisition by us in accordance with gaap under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities of qep and its subsidiaries will be recorded as of completion of the pending merger at their respective fair values and added to those of us our reported financial condition and results of operations for the periods after completion of the pending merger will reflect qep balances and results after completion of the pending 

merger but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of qep and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the completion of the pending merger 

under the acquisition method of accounting the total purchase price will be allocated to qep’s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the pending merger the excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill we expect that the pending merger may result in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting to the extent goodwill or intangibles are recorded and the values become impaired the combined company may be required to recognize material noncash charges relating to such impairment the combined company’s operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment 

the combined company may not be able to retain customers or suppliers and customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with the combined company either of which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us as a result of the pending merger 

as a result of the pending merger the combined company may experience impacts on relationships with customers and suppliers that may harm the combined company’s business and results of operations certain customers or suppliers may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the completion of the pending merger whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result of the pending merger there can be no guarantee that customers and suppliers will remain with or continue to have a relationship with the combined company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the closing of the pending merger if any customers or suppliers seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue their relationships with the combined company then the combined company’s business and results of operations may be harmed if the combined company’s suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with the combined company then the combined company may be unable to procure necessary supplies or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

qep also has contracts with vendors landlords licensors and other business partners which may require qep to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the pending merger if these consents cannot be obtained the combined company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue incur costs andor lose rights that may be material to the business of the combined company in addition third parties with whom diamondback or qep currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their relationship with either party in anticipation of the closing of the pending merger any such disruptions could limit the combined company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the pending merger the adverse effect of any such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the pending merger or by a termination of the merger agreement 

declaration payment and amounts of dividends if any distributed to our stockholders will be uncertain 

although we have paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past our board of directors may determine not to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the amount of dividends paid in the future any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

our business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the spread of covid19 caused and is continuing to cause severe disruptions in the worldwide and us economies including contributing to the reduced global and domestic demand for oil and natural gas which has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover since the beginning of january 2020 the covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the united states the continued spread of covid19 could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business if covid19 continues to spread or the response to contain or mitigate the covid19 pandemic through the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines including the vaccines recently approved by the fda for emergency use in the us is unsuccessful we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations due to the rapid development and fluidity of this situation we cannot make any prediction as to the ultimate material adverse impact of the covid 19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices and continued volatility in the oil and natural gas markets have negatively impacted and are likely to continue to negatively impact our exploration and production activities which has adversely impacted our business financial condition and results of operations in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and estimates of our proved reserves  

in early march 2020 oil prices dropped sharply and then continued to decline reaching negative levels this was a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets including actions taken by opec members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and a significant decrease in demand due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic while opec members and certain other nations agreed in april 2020 to cut production and subsequently extended such production cuts through december 2020 which helped to reduce a portion of the excess supply in the market and improve crude oil prices they agreed to increase production by 500000 barrels per day beginning in january 2021 as a result downward pressure on commodity prices has continued and could continue for the foreseeable future we cannot predict if or when commodity prices will stabilize and at what levels 

as a result of the reduction in crude oil demand caused by factors discussed above we lowered our 2020 capital budget and production guidance curtailed near term production and reduced our rig count all of which may be subject to further reductions or curtailments if the commodity markets and macroeconomic conditions worsen although we have restored our curtailed production actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic and depressed commodity pricing environment have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial results and cash flows 

based on the results of the quarterly ceiling test we were required to record an impairment on our proved oil and natural gas interests for the year ended december 31 2020 if commodity prices fall below current levels we may be required to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material further if commodity prices decrease our production proved reserves and cash flows will be adversely impacted 

other significant factors that are likely to continue to affect commodity prices in future periods include but are not limited to the effect of us energy monetary and trade policies us and global political and economic developments including the biden administration’s energy and environmental policies and the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on conditions in the us oil and natural gas industry all of which are beyond our control 

our results of operations may be also adversely impacted by any future government rule regulation or order that may impose production limits as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints in the permian basin where we operate 

we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these factors on our business financial condition and results of operation 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 

our business could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our activities a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our business strategy and cash flows 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production the cost of exploring for developing producing and delivering oil and natural gas the price and quantity of foreign imports political and economic conditions in oil producing countries including the middle east africa south america and russia the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts the level of consumer 

product demand extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters risks associated with operating drilling rigs technological advances affecting energy consumption the price and availability of alternative fuels domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action including us military operations in the middle east global or national health concerns including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such as covid19 the proximity cost availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall domestic and global economic conditions 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during 2020 nymex wti prices ranged from 3763 to 6327 per bbl and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas ranged from 148 to 335 per mmbtu if the prices of oil and natural gas decline further our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to writedown as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2020 our total capital expenditures including expenditures for drilling infrastructure and additions to midstream assets were approximately 19 billion our 2021 capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 14 billion to 16 billion representing a decrease of 50 from our 2020 capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures for our drilling operations with cash flow from operations while future acquisitions may also be funded from operations as well as proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including our proved reserves the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold our ability to acquire locate and produce economically new reserves and our ability to borrow under our credit facility 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2021 could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including recoverable reserves future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals if these acquisitions include geographic regions in which we do not currently operate as in the case of the pending merger with qep we could be subject to unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

at an assumed price of approximately 6000 per bbl wti we currently have approximately 10413 gross 6863 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2020 only 628 of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified approximately 2708 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business through december 31 2020 we are the operator of have participated in or have acquired working interest in a total of 2380 horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

multiwell pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results 

we utilize multiwell pad drilling where practical because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location multiwell pad drilling delays the commencement of production which may cause volatility in our operating results 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2021 we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into commodity price derivatives for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2021 and 2022 production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil and may be exposed to other risks including counterparty credit risk 

we use commodity price derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further we may not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 

at settlement market prices for commodities may exceed the contract prices in our commodity price derivatives agreements resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties further by using commodity derivative instruments we expose ourselves to credit risk if we are in a positive position at contract settlement and the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract we do not require collateral from our counterparties 

for additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of december 31 2020 see note 15— derivatives to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to longterm crude oil agreements under which subject to certain terms and conditions we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to such companies our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions beyond our control if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 56 million at december 31 2020 and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 281 million at december 31 2020 joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2020 four purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 1130 1354 and 1262 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively depletion for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was 12 billion 14 billion and 595 million respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense we use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

an impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties of 60 billion and 790 million was recorded for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively no impairments on proved oil and natural gas properties were recorded for the year ended december 31 2018 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities—oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

approximately 38 of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31 2020 were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves 

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 

our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids and extreme weather conditions such as the recent severe winter storms in the permian basin and their adverse impact on production volumes availability of electrical power road accessibility and transportation facilities in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of december 31 2020 most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the wolfberry play in the midland basin this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field 

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2020 four purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business operations have grown substantially since our initial public offering in october 2012 and we expect our business operations to continue to grow in the future as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of 

multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system which interconnects with third party pipelines our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations further these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us in addition federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and 

regulations may continue in the longterm and at the state and local levels see item 1 “business—regulation” for a detailed description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

derivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the july 2010 doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which we refer to as doddfrank act provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission which we refer to as the cftc the sec and federal regulators of financial institutions which we refer to as the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities 

although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act remain to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued many rules to implement the doddfrank act including a rule which we refer to as the mandatory clearing rule requiring clearing of hedges or swaps that are subject to it currently only certain interest rate and credit default swaps a rule which we refer to as the end user exception establishing an “end user” exception to the mandatory clearing rule a rule which we refer to as the margin rule setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the margin rule for end users that are not financial end users which exception we refer to as the nonfinancial end user exception and a rule imposing position limits which we refer to as the position limit rule and also an exception to the position limit rule for swaps that constitute a “bona fide hedging transaction or position” within the definition of such term under the position limit rule subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the position limit rule which we refer to as the bona fide hedging exception 

we qualify for the end user exception to the mandatory clearing rule we qualify for the nonfinancial end user exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the margin rule and each of our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitutes a “bona fide hedging transaction or position” under the position limit rule and we intend to undertake the filing recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging exception under the position limit rule so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules however most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the end user exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers major swap participants financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the nonfinancial end user exception in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations including laws and regulations giving the european union financial authorities the power to writedown amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations andor require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts which we refer to collectively as foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations which we refer to as foreign counterparties and the us adopted law and rules which we call the us resolution stay rules clarifying similar rights of us banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation the doddfrank act the rules which have been adopted and not vacated the limit rule and the us resolution stay rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties the foreign regulations could have similar effects if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the doddfrank act and regulation the us resolution stay rules and foreign regulations our results of operations may 

become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the doddfrank act and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and our results of operations 

recently enacted us tax legislation as well as future us tax legislation may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and natural gas industry including i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration development or similar activities could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

if third party pipelines or other facilities interconnected to rattler llc’s midstream systems become partially or fully unavailable or if the volumes we gather or treat do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities our midstream operations could be adversely affected 

our subsidiary rattler llc’s midstream systems are connected to other pipelines or facilities the majority of which are owned by third parties the continuing operation of such third party pipelines or facilities is not within our control if any of these pipelines or facilities becomes unable to transport treat or process natural gas or crude oil or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities our midstream operations could be adversely affected 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and 

other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including unusual or unexpected geological formations loss of drilling fluid circulation title problems facility or equipment malfunctions unexpected operational events shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements and adverse weather conditions 

any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for 

environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations we maintain insurance to protect against claims made for bodily injury and property damage and that insurance includes coverage for cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have limited coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 

our business could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our activities we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and cash flows 

the results of the 2020 us presidential and congressional elections may create regulatory uncertainty for the oil and natural gas industry changes in environmental laws could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our business financial condition and cash flows 

the results of the 2020 us presidential election as well as a closely divided congress may create regulatory uncertainty in the oil and natural gas industry during his first weeks in office president biden has issued several executive orders promoting various programs and initiatives designed to among other things curtail climate change control the release of methane from new and existing oil and natural gas operations and pause new oil and natural gas leasing on public lands it remains unclear what additional actions president biden will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from congress further it is uncertain to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations may affect our business or operations however such actions could significantly increase our operating costs or impair our ability to explore and develop other projects which could adversely impact our business financial condition and cash flows 

our operations depend heavily on electrical power internet and telecommunication infrastructure and information and computer systems if any of these systems are compromised or unavailable our business could be adversely affected 

we are heavily dependent on electrical power internet and telecommunications infrastructure and our information systems and computerbased programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such infrastructure systems or programs were to fail or become unavailable or compromised or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure our ability to safely and effectively operate our business will be limited and any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss 

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of our vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of our business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets however we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our indebtedness 

references in this section to “us “we” or “our” shall mean diamondback energy inc and diamondback og llc collectively unless otherwise specified 

we have relied in the past and we may rely from time to time in the future on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures unless we are able to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility with cash flow from operations and proceeds from equity or debt offerings implementing our capital programs may require an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances in addition a reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility and the inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures 

we have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures we expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings in the past we have created availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings we cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings instead we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding if the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2020 we had total consolidated outstanding principal indebtedness of 58 billion including 46 billion outstanding under our senior notes and 23 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we had 198 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 viper llc one of our subsidiaries had 84 million in outstanding borrowings and 496 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility and 480 million outstanding under its 5375 senior notes due 2027 as of december 31 2020 rattler llc one of our subsidiaries had 79 million in outstanding borrowings and 521 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility and 500 million outstanding under its 5625 senior notes due 2025 

we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following our high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt instruments including any repurchase obligations that may arise thereunder a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness which could reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes our high level of debt could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions the covenants contained in the agreements governing certain of our outstanding indebtedness will limit our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay dividends and make certain investments our high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing our debt covenants may also limit management’s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the economy and in our industry our high level of debt could limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms our high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes and we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases as our borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable interest rates 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidies face 

restrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

certain of our debt instruments contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness make certain investments create 

liens sell or transfer assets issue preferred stock merge or consolidate with another entity pay dividends or make other distributions create unrestricted subsidiaries and engage in transactions with affiliates 

under our revolving credit facility we are allowed among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under our revolving credit facility we designated viper viper’s general partner viper’s subsidiary rattler rattler’s general partner and rattler’s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the revolving credit facility including the related guaranty further viper viper’s general partner viper’s subsidiaries rattler rattler’s general partner and rattler’s subsidiaries are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 

we and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments as an example our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio the requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument if default occurs under our revolving credit facility the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

our indebtedness is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries and our obligations are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries 

our senior indebtedness obligations are obligations exclusively of diamondback energy inc and diamondback og llc and not of any of our other subsidiaries none of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of our senior indebtedness any assets of our subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries and therefore the claims of our creditors including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims consequently our senior indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish for additional information regarding our subsidiaries outstanding debt as of december 31 2020 see note 11— debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations the indenture governing the 2025 senior notes restricts our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend or distribution payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so further the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries’ notes allow us to issue additional notes incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our viper llc’s and rattler llc’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate tied to libor libor tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts including general shortterm interest rates rates set by the us federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 202 during the year ended december 31 2020 viper llc’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 220 during the year ended december 31 2020 rattler llc’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 210 during the year ended december 31 2020 if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

on july 27 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established or if libor will continue to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is considering replacing us dollar libor with a newly created index it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united states or elsewhere 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested permits any of our stockholders officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments and provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity transaction or other matter other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have i acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or ii acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in the past and may in the future engage in transactions with our affiliates the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

in the past we have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies and may do so again in the future these transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including our quarterly or annual operating results changes in our earnings estimates investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry additions or departures of key personnel changes in the business earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts’ projections changes in industry general market or economic conditions and announcements of legislative or regulatory changes 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

the declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders 

on february 13 2018 we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018 the decision to pay any future dividends however is solely within the discretion of and subject to approval by our board of directors our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends including the record date the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination based on its evaluation of these factors the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders 

in may 2019 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 2 billion of our outstanding common stock through december 31 2020 this repurchase program is at the discretion of our board of directors and may be suspended from time to time modified extended or discontinued by our board of directors at any time the repurchase program was suspended beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and expired on december 31 2020 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 

as of december 31 2020 we had a net operating loss or nol carry forward of approximately 23 billion for federal income tax purposes if we were to experience an “ownership change” as determined under section 382 of the code our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with nols generated prior to the ownership change would be limited possibly substantially in general an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our prechange nols that we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by an interest rate periodically promulgated by the irs referred to as the longterm taxexempt rate in general an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in the ownership of our stock totaling more than 50 percentage points by one or more “5 shareholders” as defined in the code at any time during a rolling threeyear period 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent the ability of our board of directors to adopt amend or repeal bylaws and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 23 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 23 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 23 of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report the following discussion contains “forwardlooking statements” that reflect our future plans estimates beliefs and expected performance actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors see item 1a “risk factors” and “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” 

overview 

we operate in two operating segments i the upstream segment which is engaged in the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the permian basin in west texas and ii through our subsidiary rattler the midstream operations segment which is focused on ownership operation development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the midland and delaware basins of the permian basin 

upstream operations 

in our upstream segment our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the wolfcamp and spraberry formations in the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in the delaware basin we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multiyear inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 378678 net acres which primarily consisted of approximately 194591 net acres in the midland basin and approximately 152587 net acres in the delaware basin as of december 31 2020 we had an estimated 10413 gross horizontal locations that we believe to be economic at 6000 per bbl wti 

in addition our publicly traded subsidiary viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 787264 gross acres and 24350 net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale approximately 52 of these net royalty acres are operated by us 

midstream operations 

in our midstream operations segment rattler’s crude oil infrastructure assets consist of gathering pipelines and metering facilities which collectively gather crude oil for its customers rattler’s facilities gather crude oil from horizontal and vertical wells in our reward spanish trail pecos and fivestones areas within the permian basin rattler’s natural gas gathering and compression system consists of gathering pipelines compression and metering facilities which collectively service the production from our pecos area assets within the permian basin rattler’s water sourcing and distribution assets consists of water wells frac pits pipelines and water treatment facilities which collectively gather and distribute water from permian basin aquifers to the drilling and completion sites through buried pipelines and temporary surface pipelines rattler’s gathering and disposal system spans approximately 517 miles and consists of gathering pipelines along with produced water disposal or pwd wells and facilities which collectively gather and dispose of produced water from operations throughout our permian basin acreage 

we have entered into multiple feebased commercial agreements with rattler each with an initial term ending in 2034 utilizing rattler’s infrastructure assets or its planned infrastructure assets to provide an array of essential services critical to our upstream operations in the delaware and midland basins our agreements with rattler include substantial acreage dedications 

2020 transactions and recent developments 

covid19 and collapse in commodity prices 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the global outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 as a “pandemic” to limit the spread of covid19 governments have taken various actions including the issuance of stayathome orders and social distancing guidelines causing some businesses to suspend operations and a reduction in demand for many products from direct or ultimate customers although many stayathome orders have expired and certain restrictions on conducting business have been lifted the covid19 pandemic resulted in a 

widespread health crisis and a swift and unprecedented reduction in international and us economic activity which in turn has adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas and caused significant volatility and disruption of the financial markets 

in early march 2020 oil prices dropped sharply and continued to decline reaching negative levels during 2020 the posted price for the wti price for crude oil ranged from 3763 to 6327 per barrel or bbl and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas ranged from 148 to 335 per mmbtu on january 29 2021 the nymex wti price for crude oil was 5220 per bbl and the nymex henry hub price of natural gas was 256 per mmbtu in response to recent volatility in commodity prices many producers have reduced their capital expenditure budgets this was a result of multiple factors affecting the supply and demand in global oil and natural gas markets including actions taken by opec members and other exporting nations impacting commodity price and production levels and a significant decrease in demand due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic while opec members and certain other nations agreed in april 2020 to cut production and subsequently extended such production cuts through december 2020 which helped to reduce a portion of the excess supply in the market and improve crude oil prices they agreed to increase production by 500000 barrels per day beginning in january 2021 we cannot predict if or when commodity prices will stabilize and at what levels 

as a result of the reduction in crude oil demand caused by factors discussed above in 2020 we lowered our 2020 capital budgets and production guidance curtailed near term production and reduced rig count all of which may be subject to further reductions or curtailment if the commodity markets and macroeconomic conditions worsen although we have restored curtailed production actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic and depressed commodity pricing environment have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial results and cash flows 

in addition as a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices in early march 2020 and the continued depressed oil pricing throughout the second and third quarters of 2020 we recorded 60 billion of aggregate noncash ceiling test impairments for the year ended december 31 2020 these impairment charges adversely affected our results of operations but did not reduce our cash flows if the trailing 12month commodity prices continue to fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters we will have material write downs in subsequent quarters our production proved reserves and cash flows will also be adversely impacted our results of operations may be further adversely impacted by any government rule regulation or order that may impose production limits as well as pipeline capacity and storage constraints in the permian basin where we operate 

given the dynamic nature of these events we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the covid19 pandemic the depressed commodity prices and the adverse macroeconomic conditions will persist the full extent of the impact they will have on our industry and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows or the pace or extent of any subsequent recovery

operational update 

our development program is focused entirely within the permian basin where we continue to focus on longlateral multiwell pad development our horizontal development consists of multiple targeted intervals primarily within the wolfcamp and spraberry formations in the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone springs formations in the delaware basin 

as of december 31 2020 we were operating eight drilling rigs and currently intend to operate between eight and 12 drilling rigs in 2021 on average across our current acreage position in the midland and delaware basins 

in the midland basin we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within midland martin howard glasscock and andrews counties where development has primarily focused on drilling longlateral multiwell pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations 

in the delaware basin we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in pecos reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a which we believe has been derisked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target in 2021 we expect to focus development on these areas 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we executed on our business strategy providing a foundation for continued solid operational performance in 2021 we are starting to see the benefits from our strategy to cut activity and highgrade development focusing on our most productive areas in terms of capital efficiency and earlytime well performance while the impact of the recent winter storms in the permian basin on the first quarter 2021 production is expected to be significant ranging from four to five days of total net production lost we expect to overcome this adverse impact for the full year 2021 well costs and cash operating costs remain near alltime lows providing for increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months in 2021 we intend to continue to focus on low cost operations and best in class execution and currently plan to hold our fourth quarter 2020 production flat while generating free cash flow used to pay dividends and pay down debt to combat potential fluctuation in service costs we have worked to implement new and more efficient drilling and completions methodologies and will continue to seek opportunities to control additional well cost where possible our 2021 drilling and completion budget accounts for capital costs that we expect to occur during the year 

in 2021 we remain focused on navigating our industry challenges by staying disciplined improving our industryleading cost structure maintaining production and increasing environmental transparency 

environmental responsibility initiatives and highlights 

in february 2021 we announced significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental social responsibility and governance or esg performance and disclosure including scope 1 and methane emission intensity reduction targets our goals include the reduction of our scope 1 greenhouse gas intensity by at least 50 and methane intensity by at least 70 in each case by 2024 from the 2019 levels to further underscore our commitment to carbon neutrality we are also implementing our “net zero now” initiative under which effective january 1 2021 every hydrocarbon molecule we produce is anticipated to be produced with zero scope 1 emissions to the extent our greenhouse gas and methane intensity targets do not eliminate our carbon footprint we intend to purchase carbon credits to offset the remaining emissions we also plan to increase the weighting of esg metrics in our annual shortterm incentive compensation plan to motivate our executives to advance our environmental responsibility goals 

with respect to flaring we flared 09 of our gross natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the full year ended 2020 we flared 20 of our gross natural gas production down 64 from 2019 

2021 capital budget 

we have currently budgeted 2021 total capital spend of 14 billion to 16 billion consisting of 12 billion to 14 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity 60 million to 80 million for midstream investments excluding joint venture investments and 70 million to 90 million for infrastructure and other expenditures excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions we expect to drill and complete 215 to 235 gross horizontal wells in 2021 should commodity prices weaken we intend to act responsibly and consistent with our prior practices reduce capital spending if commodity prices strengthen we intend to grow oil production within our 2021 budget pay down indebtedness and return cash to our stockholders 

results of operations 

for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 please refer to “ part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 27 2020 which discussion is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on form 10k the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 



1 hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices and include gains and losses on cash settlements for matured commodity derivatives which we do not designate for hedge accounting hedged prices exclude gains or losses resulting from the early settlement of commodity derivative contracts 

production data 

substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids production the following tables set forth our production data for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



comparison of the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

oil natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues our revenues are a function of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes 

the net dollar effect of the change in prices are shown below 



1 production volumes are presented in mbbls for oil and natural gas liquids and mmcf for natural gas 

our oil natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues decreased by approximately 11 billion or 29 to 28 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 from 39 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 largely attributable to lower oil average sales prices resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic and other volatility in global commodity prices as discussed in “—covid19 and collapse in commodity prices” above 

average daily production sold increased by 17359 boed to 300331 boed during the year ended december 31 2020 from 282972 boed during the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to an increase in natural gas liquids and natural gas production which was partially offset by temporarily curtailing a portion of our oil production volumes during 2020 in response to the sudden drop in demand and prices for oil stemming from the covid19 pandemic 

midstream services revenue the following table shows midstream services revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



our midstream services revenue represents fees charged to our joint interest owners and third parties for the transportation of oil and natural gas along with water gathering and related disposal facilities midstream services revenue decreased by 14 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to a reduction in sourced water volumes due to the lower level of drilling and completion activity in 2020 

lease operating expenses the following table shows lease operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



lease operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 decreased by 65 million or 087 per boe lease operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in work over and well maintenance activity through overall efficiencies gained as well as improvements in infrastructure which reduced power generation costs and trucking fees in addition to these efficiencies we have seen a reduction in service pricing in 2020 driven by the reduction in current industry activity levels we expect service pricing may increase in future periods particularly if current industry activity levels increase 

production and ad valorem tax expense the following table shows production and ad valorem tax expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



in general production taxes are directly related to production revenues and are based upon current year commodity prices production taxes for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 decreased by 49 million or 055 per boe due to current year commodity prices production taxes as a percentage of production revenues remained consistent for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

gathering and transportation expense the following table shows gathering and transportation expense for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



for the year ended december 31 2020 the per boe increases for gathering and transportation expenses are primarily attributable to recording minimum volume commitment fees in 2020 as well as an increase in fees for our gas production and an overall change in our product mix with gas and natural gas liquids production becoming a greater percentage of overall production 

midstream services expense the following table shows midstream services expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities midstream services expense for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 14 million primarily due to increased volume and build out of the rattler systems 

depreciation depletion and amortization the following table provides the components of our depreciation depletion and amortization expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



the decrease in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 156 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 resulted primarily from a reduction in the average depletion rate for our oil and natural gas properties in 2020 which stemmed from a decrease in the net book value of our properties due to the full cost ceiling impairments recorded in the first three quarters of 2020 as well as lower production levels in 2020 as compared to 2019 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties as a result of the decline in commodity prices during 2020 and 2019 we recorded noncash ceiling test impairments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 of 60 billion and 790 million respectively which is included in accumulated depletion depreciation amortization and impairment on our consolidated balance sheet the impairment charges affected our results of operations but did not reduce cash flow in addition to commodity prices our production rates levels of proved reserves future development costs transfers of unevaluated properties and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analysis in future periods if the trailing 12month commodity prices continue to fall as compared to the commodity prices used in prior quarters we will continue to have material writedowns in subsequent quarters 

general and administrative expenses the following table shows general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 decreased by 16 million primarily due to a decrease in noncash stockbased compensation 

net interest expense the following table shows net interest expense for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



net interest expense increased by 25 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 this increase was primarily due to an increase in borrowings resulting from the issuance of the may 2020 notes and the rattler notes see note 11— debt for further details regarding outstanding borrowings and interest expense 

derivatives the following table shows the net gain loss on derivative instruments and the net cash received paid on settlements of derivative instruments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives to the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods we will have marktomarket gains while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods we will have marktomarket losses 

net cash received paid on settlements of derivative instruments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 include cash received on contracts terminated prior to their contractual maturity of 17 million related to commodity contracts and 43 million related to interest rate swap contracts respectively 

provision for benefit from income taxes the following table shows the provision for benefit from income taxes for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



the change in our income tax provision was primarily due to the pretax loss for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to pretax income for the year ended december 31 2019 and the impact of recording a valuation allowance on viper’s deferred tax assets during the year ended december 31 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes our primary uses of capital have been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties 

as we pursue our business and financial strategy we regularly consider which capital resources including cash flow and equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us continued prolonged volatility in the capital financial andor credit markets due to the covid19 pandemic the depressed commodity markets andor adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our access to or increase our cost of capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are presented below 



operating activities 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “–sources of our revenue” and item 1a “risk factors” above 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 27 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to a decline in our oil and natural gas revenues which was partially offset by a decrease in lease operating expenses and other operating expenses and an increase in cash received on settlements of our derivative contracts 

investing activities 

the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties and related assets and contributions to our equity method investments accounted for the majority of our 21 billion and 39 billion in cash outlays for investing activities during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

contributions to equity method investments decreased to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 485 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as construction of both the epic pipeline and gray oak pipeline which required substantial capital in 2019 was completed during april 2020 as of december 31 2020 rattler’s anticipated future capital commitments for its equity method investments total 72 million in the aggregate for additional information regarding our equity method investments see note 10— equity method investments included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

capital expenditure activities 

our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and equity method investments on a cash basis were as follows for the specified period 



1 during the year ended december 31 2020 in conjunction with our development program we drilled 208 gross 195 net operated horizontal wells of which 75 gross 70 net wells were in the delaware basin and the remaining wells were in the midland basin and turned 171 gross 159 net operated horizontal wells to production of which 78 gross 74 net wells were in the delaware basin and the remaining wells were in the midland basin 

2 during the year ended december 31 2019 in conjunction with our development program we drilled 330 gross 296 net operated horizontal wells of which 159 gross 142 net wells were in the delaware basin and the remaining wells were in the midland basin and turned 317 gross 289 net operated horizontal wells to production of which 139 gross 126 net wells were in the delaware basin and the remaining wells were in the midland basin 

financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the amount used in financing activities was primarily attributable to 348 million of repayments net of borrowings on our credit facilities 239 million in aggregate repayments on the energen notes and viper notes 236 million in dividends paid to stockholders 98 million of share repurchases as part of our stock repurchase program and 93 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest these cash outlays were partially offset by net proceeds of 997 million from the issuance of the may 2020 notes and the rattler notes during 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to 341 million in net proceeds from viper’s public offering completed on march 1 2019 720 million in net proceeds from the rattler offering 39 million in proceeds from joint ventures and 22 billion in proceeds from the december 2019 notes net of repayments partially offset by 14 billion of repayments net of borrowings under our credit facility 44 million of premium on debt extinguishment 122 million of distributions to our noncontrolling interest 13 million of share 

repurchases for tax withholdings 593 million of share repurchases as part of our stock repurchase program and 112 million of dividends to stockholders 

indebtedness 

second amended and restated credit facility 

at december 31 2020 the maximum credit amount available under our credit agreement was 20 billion and the maturity date is november 1 2022 as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 23 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility which we believe provides ample availability for future borrowings including funding for the cash portion of the guidon acquisition in the first quarter of 2021 as of december 31 2020 there was an aggregate of 3 million in letters of credit outstanding under our credit agreement which reduce available borrowings on a dollar for dollar basis the weighted average interest rate on the credit agreement was 202 for the year ended december 31 2020

for additional information regarding our indebtedness see note 11— debt included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2021 capital budget for drilling midstream and infrastructure of 14 billion to 16 billion representing a decrease of 50 from our 2020 capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

• 12 billion to 14 billion will be spent on drilling and completing 215 to 235 gross 197 to 215 net horizontal wells across our operated leasehold acreage in the northern midland and southern delaware basins with an average lateral length of approximately 10100 feet 

• 60 million to 80 million will be spent on midstream infrastructure excluding joint venture investments and 

• 70 million to 90 million will be spent on infrastructure and other expenditures excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions 

we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we spent 16 billion on drilling and completion 140 million on midstream 108 million on infrastructure and 58 million on nonoperated properties for total capital expenditures of 19 billion 

in may 2019 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 2 billion of our outstanding common stock through december 31 2020 we repurchased approximately 98 million of our common stock under this program during the year ended december 31 2020 prior to the program’s expiration 

the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners we are currently operating eight drilling rigs and nine completion crews we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions 

based upon current oil and natural gas prices and production expectations for 2021 we believe our cash flows from operations cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2021 however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2021 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to the results of our drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves if there is a decline in commodity prices our revenues cash flows results of operations liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

guarantor financial information 

as of december 31 2020 diamondback og llc is the sole guarantor under the december 2019 notes indenture governing the december 2019 notes the may 2020 notes and the 2025 indenture governing the 2025 senior notes 

guarantees are “full and unconditional” as that term is used in regulation sx rule 310b3 except that such guarantees will be released or terminated in certain circumstances set forth in the december 2019 notes indenture and the 2025 indenture such as with certain exceptions 1 in the event diamondback og llc or all or substantially all of its assets is sold or disposed of 2 in the event diamondback og llc ceases to be a guarantor of or otherwise be an obligor under certain other indebtedness and 3 in connection with any covenant defeasance legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the relevant indenture 

diamondback og llc’s guarantees of the december 2019 notes the may 2020 notes and the 2025 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of its future subordinated indebtedness equal in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness including its obligations under its revolving credit facility and effectively subordinated to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness 

the rights of holders of the senior notes against diamondback og llc may be limited under the us bankruptcy code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit diamondback og llc’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance however there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of diamondback og llc moreover this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws there is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside in which case the entire liability may be extinguished 

the following tables present summarized financial information for diamondback energy inc as the parent and diamondback og llc as the guarantor subsidiary on a combined basis after elimination of i intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the guarantor subsidiary and ii equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a nonguarantor the information is presented in accordance with the requirements of rule 1301 under the sec’s regulation sx the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the guarantor subsidiary operated as an independent entity 





contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 



1 includes the outstanding principal amount under the revolving credit facilities the table does not include commitment fees interest expense or other fees payable under this floating rate facility as we cannot predict the timing of future borrowings and repayments or interest rates to be charged 

2 interest represents the scheduled cash payments on the senior notes and energen notes 

3 amounts represent our estimates of future asset retirement obligations because these costs typically extend many years into the future estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors including the rate of inflation changing technology and the political and regulatory environment see note 9—asset retirement obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

4 drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services under contracts to which the company was a party on december 31 2020 

5 timing of when capital commitments will be requested can vary 

6 operating lease obligations represent future commitments for building equipment and vehicle leases 

the table above does not include estimated deficiency fees related to certain volume commitments as they are based off future volume deliveries and differences from market pricing which we cannot predict 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies cover accounting estimates that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown and actual results could differ from those estimates 

any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include i the method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties ii estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom iii impairments of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties iv fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and v estimates of income taxes 

below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties 

depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves if our production remains at approximately the same level from year to year depletion expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

impairment 

under the full cost method of accounting we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter the test determines a limit or ceiling on the book value of the proved oil and natural gas properties net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum from proved reserves based on the trailing 12month unweighted average of the firstdayofthemonth price adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet b the cost of properties not being amortized if any and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties if the net book value including related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling an impairment or noncash writedown is required impairments of our evaluated oil and natural gas properties are not reversible 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas we exercise significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used the level of production volumes to include in our commodity derivative contracts the prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts and the counterparties’ creditworthiness 

we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and as a result mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash change in fair value on derivative instruments for each period in the consolidated statements of operations we are also required to recognize our derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value with such amounts classified as current or longterm based on their anticipated settlement dates the accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation and is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon among other things futures prices and time to maturity these fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions including any deferred premiums that are with the same counterparty and are subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow marktomarket accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur 

income taxes 

the amount of income taxes we record requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal state and provincial tax jurisdictions we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of judgment by management these assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances change material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure in our exploration and production business is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use derivatives including swaps basis swaps swaptions roll hedges and costless collars to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales 

at december 31 2020 we had a net liability derivative position of 255 million related to our commodity price risk derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our commodity price derivatives as of december 31 2020 a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net liability position to 284 million an increase of 29 million while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net liability derivative position to 226 million a decrease of 29 million however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

in our midstream operations business we have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause us or rattler’s other customers to delay drilling or shut in production which would reduce the volumes available for gathering and processing by our infrastructure assets if we or rattler’s other customers delay drilling or temporarily shut in production due to persistently low commodity prices or for any other reason our revenue in the midstream operations segment could decrease as rattler’s commercial agreements do not contain minimum volume commitments 

for additional information on our open commodity derivative instruments at december 31 2020 see note 15— derivatives  

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are due to the concentration of receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 281 million at december 31 2020 and to a lesser extent receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 56 million at december 31 2020 

we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2020 four purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods our allowances for credit losses were insignificant at december 31 2020 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic depressed commodity pricing environment and adverse macroeconomic conditions may enhance our customer credit risk 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 0125 to 10 per annum in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1125 to 20 per annum in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base historically we have used interest rate swaps and treasury locks to reduce our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with our revolving credit facility

our properties 

location and land 

our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 455378 gross  382337 net acres which consisted primarily of approximately 218138 gross  195461 net acres in the midland basin and approximately 196171 gross  155296 net acres in the delaware basin at december 31 2019  we are the operator of approximately 97 of this permian basin acreage in addition our publicly traded subsidiary viper owns mineral interests underlying approximately 814224 gross acres and 24304 net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale approximately 50 of these net royalty acres are operated by us 

further our subsidiary rattler is focused on ownership operation development and acquisition of the midstream infrastructure assets in the midland and delaware basins of the permian basin as of december 31 2019 rattler owned and operated 867 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines natural gas gathering pipelines and a fully integrated water system on acreage that overlays our seven core midland and delaware basin development areas to facilitate the transportation of water and hydrocarbon volumes away from the producing wellhead to ensuring the efficient operations of a crude oil or natural gas well rattler’s midstream infrastructure includes a network of gathering pipelines that collect and transport crude oil natural gas and produced water from our operations in the midland and delaware basins 

as of december 31 2019 rattler also owned i a 10 equity interest in epic crude holdings lp which is building a longhaul crude oil pipeline from the permian basin and the eagle ford shale to corpus christi texas that upon completion will be capable of transporting approximately 590000 bbld and with installation of additional pumps and storage up to approximately 900000 bbld which we refer to as the epic pipeline ii a 10 equity interest in gray oak pipeline llc which is building a longhaul crude oil pipeline that upon completion will be capable for transporting 900000 bbld from the permian basin and the eagle ford shale to points alongside the texas gulf coast including a marine terminal connection in corpus christi texas which we refer to as the gray oak pipeline iii a 4 equity interest in wink to webster pipeline llc which is developing a crude oil pipeline that upon completion will be capable of transporting approximately 1000000 bbld from origin points at wink and midland in the permian basin for delivery to multiple houston area locations iv a 60 equity interest in omog jv llc a newly formed joint venture entity that acquired reliance midstream llc which operates over 230 miles of crude oil gathering and regional transportation pipelines and approximately 200000 barrels of crude oil storage in midland martin andrews and ector counties texas and v a 50 equity interest in amarillo rattler llc which will operate the yellow rose gas gathering and processing system with estimated total capacity of 40000 mcfd and over 84 miles of gathering and regional transportation pipelines in dawson martin and andrews counties texas each of the epic and gray oak pipelines began interim operations in the second half of 2019 and we expect both to begin full commercial operations in the second quarter of 2020 the wink to webster project is expected to begin commercial operations in first half of 2021 we anticipate that the yellow rose system will commence full commercial operations in the middle of 2021 

the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry bone spring wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play since then we and most other operators are almost exclusively drilling horizontal wells in the development of unconventional reservoirs in the permian basin as of december 31 2019  we held working interests in 2656 gross  2202 net producing wells and only royalty interests in 4161 additional wells 

geology 

the greater permian basin formed as an area of rapid pennsylvanianpermian subsidence in response to dynamic structural influence of the marathon uplift and ancestral rockies it is one of the most productive sedimentary basins in the us with established oil and gas production from several stacked reservoirs of varying age ranges most notably permian aged sediments in particular the permian aged wolfcamp and spraberrybone spring formations have been heavily targeted for several decades first through vertical comingling of these zones and more recently through horizontal exploitation of each individual horizon prior to deposition of wolfcamp and spraberrybone spring formations the area of the presentday permian basin was a continuous sedimentary feature called the tabosa basin during this time ordovician silurian devonian and mississippian sediments were laid down in a primarily open marine shelf setting however some time frames saw more restrictive settings that were conducive to the deposition of organically rich mudstone such as the devonian woodford and mississippian barnettmeramec these formations are important sources and more recently reservoirs within the presentday greater permian basin 

the spraberrybone spring was deposited as siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites and debris flows along with pelagic mudstones in a deepwater basinal environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow grainflow and finegrained pelagic sediments which were also deposited in a basinal setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp and spraberrybone spring are generally found in close proximity to the central basin platform while mudstone reservoirs thicken basinward away from the central basin platform the mudstone within these reservoirs is organically rich which when buried to sufficient depth for thermal maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the mudstones themselves and in the interbedded conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs due to this complexity the wolfcamp and spraberrybone spring intervals are a hybrid reservoir system that contains characteristics of both unconventional and conventional reservoirs 

we have successfully developed several hybrid reservoir intervals within the clearfork spraberrybone spring wolfcamp and barnettmeramec formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the mudstones and some clastics exhibit low permeabilities which necessitate the need for hydraulic fracture stimulation to unlock the vast storage of hydrocarbons in these targets 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 3413 square miles of 3d data this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling program and identification of additional resource to be exploited 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2019  net production from our permian basin acreage was 103285 mboe or an average of 282972 boed of which approximately 66 was oil 18 was natural gas liquids and 16 was natural gas 

facilities 

our oil and natural gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilnatural gaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

our publicly traded subsidiary rattler owns the fasken center which has over 421000 net rentable square feet within its two office towers and associated assets in midland texas we viper and rattler are headquartered at the fasken center we and unrelated third parties lease office space within the fasken center from rattler under longterm lease agreements 

we and our subsidiaries also own field offices and related facilities in midland and reeves counties texas we believe that these facilities are adequate for our current operations 

  

recent and future activity 

during 2020  we expect to complete an estimated 320 to 360 gross  288 to 324 net operated horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2020 for drilling and infrastructure will be between 28 billion and 30 billion  consisting of 245 billion to 26 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity 200 million to 225 million for midstream investments excluding joint venture investments and 150 million to 175 million will be spent on infrastructure and other expenditures excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2019  we drilled 330 gross  296 net and completed 317 gross  289 net operated horizontal wells during the year ended december 31 2019  our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells were 26 billion  in addition we spent 364 million for oil and gas midstream and infrastructure and 776 million for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

we are operating 23 drilling rigs now including two rigs drilling produced water disposal wells and currently intend to operate between 20 and 23 rigs on average in 2020 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions 

with our current development plan we expect to continue our strong pud conversion ratio in 2020 by converting an estimated 35 of our puds to a proved developed category and develop approximately 66 of the consolidated 2019 yearend pud reserves by the end of 2021 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved 

reserves as of december 31 2019 were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 85 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 15 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our executive vice president–reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our executive vice president–reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 20 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 



 

the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“risk factors” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2019  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 253820 mbbls of oil 294051 mmcf of natural gas and 65030 mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 367859 mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2019  



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 213909 mboe from 291 gross  262 net wells in which we have a working interest and 7591 mboe from 97 gross wells in which viper owns royalty interests of the 291 gross working interest wells 64 were in the delaware basin transfers of 120920 mboe were the result of drilling or participating in 135 gross  119 net horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 79 gross wells in which we have a royalty interest or mineral interest through viper we own a working interest in 75 of the 79 gross viper wells downward revisions of 77519 mboe resulted from 67114 mboe of pud downgrades due to refinement of the pud inventory following the energen merger these downgrades were offset with extensions the remaining 10405 moe of downward revisions were mostly from lower benchmark commodity prices 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 956 million during 2019  estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 12 billion in 2020  721 million in 2021  641 million in 2022 and 576 million in 2023  since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

as of december 31 2019  all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded 

as of december 31 2019  none of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing

as of december 31 2019  we owned an average unweighted 83 working interest in 2656 gross  2202 net productive wells and an average 31 royalty interest in 4161 additional wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average unweighted 34 royalty or mineral interest in 5807 productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

the following table sets forth information regarding productive wells by basin as of december 31 2019  



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated by basin each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 







acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2019 relating to our leasehold acreage 



 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2019  that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 



title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2019  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company which we refer to as shell  27  plains marketing which we refer to as plains  23  and vitol inc which we refer to as vitol  15  for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading  26  koch supply  trading lp which we refer to as koch  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  31  koch  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

agreement with trafigura trading llc 

we have entered into a firm commitment oil purchase agreement with trafigura trading llc which we refer to as trafigura in which we agreed to sell and deliver a firm quantity of 25000 barrels of crude oil per day to trafigura during the term of the agreement under this agreement which has a sevenyear term beginning on august 1 2018 the price per barrel of oil paid to us by trafigura is based on the average of the published settlement quotations for nymex cma as adjusted for different delivery methods and periods if during the term of the agreement we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil for any month other than for specified force majeure events we have agreed to pay trafigura a deficiency payment equal to any unfavorable difference between the contract price and the spot price multiplied by the deficiency volume 

agreement with plains 

in july 2019 our whollyowned subsidiary energen resources corporation which we refer to as energen resources entered into a longterm crude oil sales agreement with plains pursuant to which among other things our existing agreements with plains were terminated our new agreement with plains requires that we make available 50000 barrels of crude oil per day until the date occurring ten years following the date service commences for exxonmobil oil corporation which we refer to as exxon pursuant to the transportation service agreement between exxon and the wink to webster pipeline carrier plus extensions for force majeure if during the term of our agreement we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil for any month other than for specified force majeure events or acts or omissions of plains we have agreed to pay plains a specified per barrel amount subject to escalation multiplied by the deficiency volume if during the term of the agreement we fail to deliver the quantities of oil for any month that we have committed for such month other than for specified force majeure events or acts or omissions of plains we have agreed to pay plains a deficiency payment we have also dedicated certain crude oil production attributable to certain of our interests to plains in connection with this agreement pricing for our production under the plains agreement i prior to the date service commences for exxon pursuant to the transportation service agreement between exxon and the wink to webster pipeline carrier is at a midland wti or wtl as applicable base price less certain costs and ii following the date service commences for exxon pursuant to the transportation service agreement between exxon and the wink to webster pipeline carrier for volumes up to 100000 barrels of crude oil per day is at a meh wti or wtl base price as applicable less certain costs 

agreement with shell 

in december 2018 we entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell which was amended and restated in december 2019 in which shell agreed to transport crude oil it purchases from us through the epic pipeline with which we have an agreement for the transportation of certain crude oil our agreement with shell provides for different purchase obligations during the precommencement and service commencement periods for the epic pipeline and provides for a threeyear term beginning on the service commencement date for the epic pipeline shell has the option to extend its purchase obligations for up to three oneyear terms but not beyond march 31 2026 except in the event of force majeure our delivery obligation i prior to the full service commencement of the epic pipeline will be subject to certain conditions including our right to repurchase certain volumes either 30000 or 40000 barrels of crude oil per day and ii during the full service term will not exceed 50000 barrels of crude oil per day in addition our whollyowned subsidiary energen resources has signed an agreement with shell in which all or a portion of the 50000 barrels of crude oil per day referenced in the previous sentence may also be satisfied by energen resources during different precommencement periods shell has agreed to pay us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for the “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the nymex over the applicable onemonth period subject to certain adjustments plus a corpus christi differential determined based on shell’s average sales price for its wti barrels in corpus christi less certain other costs expenses and fees during the full service term the price per barrel of oil payable by shell to us is based on calendar dated brent pricing plus a negotiated differential generally based on certain argus wti houston cif rotterdam and platts midland dap rotterdam pricing less certain adjustments 

agreements with vitol 

on october 18 2018 we entered into an agreement with vitol to among other things sell an average of 23750 barrels of crude oil per day plus other agreed upon volumes we are continuing to sell crude oil to vitol on a monthtomonth basis and expect to continue to do so under our existing agreement with vitol until our new agreement with vitol becomes effective under our new agreement with vitol we agreed to sell and vitol agreed to purchase i subject to certain conditions including accelerated commissioning service on the gray oak pipeline and completion of certain infrastructure connections 50000 barrels of crude oil per day on average during each month occurring during the first seven years of full service on the gray oak pipeline ii subject to certain conditions and the satisfaction of other conditions including full service on the gray oak pipeline and completion of certain infrastructure connections an additional 50000 barrels of crude oil per day on average during each month occurring during the first seven years following satisfaction of such conditions iii subject to certain conditions including notice that transportation services on the epic pipeline are ready to commence and completion of certain infrastructure connections an additional 50000 barrels of crude oil per day on average during each month occurring during the first seven years following satisfaction of such conditions and iv such other volumes of crude oil as agreed by the parties we are entitled to receive payment for such crude oil under netback pricing whereby the price for our crude oil is determined based on a formula which takes into consideration the final purchase price obtained by vitol in marketing such crude oil in certain third party transactions less certain costs in connection therewith vitol has agreed to among other things use commercially reasonable efforts to i maximize the final purchase price to us and mitigate any costs factored into the price determination and ii acquire third party crude oil to cover any shortfall below our volumes commitments vitol also agrees to i use the same care and apply the same policies as it would exercise and apply if it were trading the subject crude oil for vitol’s own account and ii transport such crude oil on certain designated pipelines including the gray oak pipeline pursuant to rights we have obtained through our gray oak transportation services agreement described below under “—transportation” under third party shipper rights or term assignments as applicable prior to vitol’s downstream marketing activities 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and in our upstream segment we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

in our midstream operations segment as rattler seeks to expand its crude oil natural gas and waterrelated midstream services it faces a high level of competition including major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather compress treat process transport store or market oil and natural gas as rattler seeks to expand to provide midstream services to third party producers it similarly faces a high level of competition competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for crude oil natural gas or ngls within the acreage dedicated by rattler to us rattler does not compete with other midstream companies to provide us with midstream services as a result of our relationship and longterm dedications to rattler’s midstream assets however we may continue to use third party service providers for certain midstream services within such dedicated acreage until the expiration or termination of certain preexisting dedications 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production in the midland and delaware basins are transported to purchasers by pipeline 

the following table presents the average percentage of produced oil sold by pipeline and the average percentage of produced water connected to saltwater disposals by pipeline 



we have entered into multiple feebased commercial agreements with rattler each with an initial term ending in 2034 utilizing rattler’s infrastructure assets or its planned infrastructure assets to provide an array of essential services critical to our upstream operations in the delaware and midland basins our agreements with rattler include a total of approximately 397000 gross acres across all rattler’s service lines across the midland and delaware basins 

we are also party to a transportation services agreement with gray oak pipeline llc pursuant to which we agreed to the accelerated commissioning service or the acs on the gray oak pipeline in the amount of 50000 barrels of crude oil per day under the acs program shippers must make a deficiency payment for any barrels not shipped during the acs term which expires the day before the gray oak pipeline goes into full service which is currently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2020 acs commenced in november 2019 and is ongoing due to restrictive api gravity provisions and the lack of markets we have been unable to ship any volumes over the gray oak pipeline since the inception of the acs 

once full service commences on the gray oak pipeline subject to the terms and conditions of this transportation services agreement we will be required to ship 50000 barrels per day of crude oil on the gray oak pipeline or pay a deficiency payment for any shortfall in volumes as measured on a quarterly basis such deficiency payments can be used as a credit against future shipments in excess of our minimum contract volume each quarter subject to certain restrictions 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1250 to 3000  resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 7000 to 8750  

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations in our exploration and production business seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations in our midstream operations business the volumes of condensate produced at rattler’s processing facilities fluctuate seasonally with volumes generally increasing in the winter months and decreasing in the summer months as a result of the physical properties of natural gas and comingled liquids severe or prolonged summers may adversely affect our results of operations in the midstream operations segment 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our o il and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non 

compliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is often strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling the resource conservation and recovery act as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” also in december 2016 the epa agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste however in april 2019 the epa concluded that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of oil and gas waste are not necessary at this time any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released 

water discharges the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak the clean 

water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit on june 29 2015 the epa and the us army corps of engineers or the corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the clean water act however on october 22 2019 the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 rules the 2015 rule and the 2019 repeal are subject to several ongoing legal challenges also on january 23 2020 the epa and the corps released a final rule replacing the 2015 rule and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the clean water act the rule is anticipated to generate further legal challenges further on april 23 2019 the epa published an interpretive statement and request for comment clarifying that the clean water act’s permitting program for pollutant discharges does not apply to releases of pollutants to groundwater as a result of such recent developments substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the clean water act to the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the clean water act’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas 

the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the oil pollution act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the oil pollution act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 

noncompliance with the clean water act or the oil pollution act may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” also on may 12 2016 the epa issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 

climate change in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs 

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties 

to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and begin negotiations to either reenter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the united states the paris agreement sets forth a specific exit process whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice on november 4 2019 the trump administration submitted its formal notification of withdrawal to the united nations it is not clear what steps if any will be taken to negotiate a new agreement or what terms would be included in such an agreement in response to the announcement many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage 

tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration in particular on may 12 2016 the epa amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new modified and reconstructed equipment processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector however in a march 28 2017 executive order president trump directed the epa to review the 2016 regulations and if appropriate to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production on june 16 2017 the epa published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations including fugitive emission requirements also on october 15 2018 the epa published a proposed rule to significantly reduce regulatory burdens imposed by the 2016 regulations including for example reducing the monitoring frequency for fugitive emissions and revising the requirements for pneumatic pumps at well sites in addition on august 28 2019 the epa proposed amendments to the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards to ease regulatory burdens including rescinding standards applicable to transmission or storage segments and eliminating methane requirements altogether legal challenges are anticipated and thus substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of these new source performance standards for oil and natural gas operations the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards to the extent implemented as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 

several states including texas and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas legislature adopted legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs 

such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing

the federal endangered species act or esa and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect listed endangered or threatened species or their habitats if endangered species are located in areas where we operate our operations or any work performed related to them could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in compliance with the esa on august 12 2019 the us fish and wildlife service and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration’s national marine fisheries service jointly published final rules that among other things tighten the critical habitat designation process and eliminate certain automatic protections for threatened species going forward nevertheless the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could result in the imposition of restrictions on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production 

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 

drilling and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties 

and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate although the corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 

natural gas sales and transportation historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales ” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services are provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations 

natural gas gathering although ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the facilities rattler llc considers to be natural gas gathering pipelines rattler believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that ferc has used to determine that pipelines perform primarily a gathering function and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated interstate transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress if ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of 1938 or nga and that the facility provides interstate transportation service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by ferc under the nga or the natural gas policy act or ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question adversely affect results of operations and cash flow in addition if any of the facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by ferc 

even though rattler llc considers its natural gas gathering pipelines to be exempt from the jurisdiction of ferc under the nga ferc regulation of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines may indirectly impact gathering services ferc’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets and gathering services in recent years ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural 

gas pipelines however there can be no assurance that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the natural gas gathering services 

natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore rattler llc’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on rattler’s or our operations but additional capital expenditures and increased operating costs may result depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

oil sales and transportation sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future 

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and our subsidiary rattler midstream operating llc has a tariff on file with ferc to perform gathering service in interstate commerce intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines including our subsidiary rattler midstream operating llc must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 

safety and maintenance regulation in our midstream operations rattler llc is subject to regulation by the us department of transportation or dot under the hazardous liquids pipeline safety act of 1979 or hlpsa and comparable state statutes with respect to design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline facilities hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products including ngls and condensate and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the united states secretary of transportation these regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these hlpsa regulations 

rattler llc is also subject to the natural gas pipeline safety act of 1968 or ngpsa and the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 the ngpsa regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities while the pipeline safety improvement act establishes mandatory inspections for all united states crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering pipelines in highconsequence areas within ten years dot through the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration or phmsa has developed regulations implementing the pipeline safety improvement act that requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other safety protections in areas where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property 

the pipeline safety and job creation act enacted in 2011 and the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 also known as the pipes act enacted in 2016 amended the hlpsa and ngpsa and increased safety regulation the pipeline safety and job creation act doubles the maximum administrative fines for safety violations from 100000 to 200000 for a single violation and from 10 million to 20 million for a related series of violations now increased for inflation to 218647 and 2186465 respectively and provides that these maximum penalty caps do not apply to civil enforcement actions establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines including the expansion of integrity management use of automatic and remotecontrolled shutoff valves leak detection systems sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines use of excess flow valves verification of maximum allowable operating pressure incident notification and other pipelinesafety related requirements the pipes act ensures that the phmsa completes the pipeline safety and job creation act requirements reforms phmsa to be a more dynamic datadriven regulator and closes gaps in federal standards 

phmsa has undertaken rulemakings to address many areas of this legislation for example on october 1 2019 phmsa published final rules to expand its integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements 

on regulated pipelines including certain segments outside high consequence areas the rules once effective also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated gathering lines the safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the pipeline safety and job creation act and the pipes act as well as any implementation of phmsa rules thereunder andor related rule making proceedings could require us to install new or modified safety controls pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in addition any material penalties or fines issued to us under these or other statutes rules regulations or orders could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operation and cash flow 

states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards and many states have undertaken responsibility to enforce the federal standards the railroad commission of texas is the agency vested with intrastate natural gas pipeline regulatory and enforcement authority in texas the commission’s regulations adopt by reference the minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of natural gas in addition on december 17 2019 the commission adopted rules requiring that operators of gathering lines take appropriate actions to fix safety hazards we do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable federal and state laws and regulations in texas our gathering pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements 

in addition we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act or osha and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers moreover the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens rattler llc and the entities in which it owns an interest are also subject to osha process safety management regulations which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic reactive flammable or explosive chemicals these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas pressurized tanks caverns and wells in excess of 10000 pounds at various locations flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt from these standards also the department of homeland security and other agencies such as the epa continue to develop regulations concerning the security of industrial facilities including crude oil and natural gas facilities we are subject to a number of requirements and must prepare federal response plans to comply we must also prepare risk management plans under the regulations promulgated by the epa to implement the requirements under the caa to prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances we have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with safeguard and security requirements we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety and security 

state regulation texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells 

comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 712 full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in birmingham alabama houston texas midland texas and oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business and properties” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have 

been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during the past five years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as wti futures contract 1 price for crude oil has ranged from a low of 2621 per barrel or bbl in february 2016 to a high of 7641 per bbl in october 2018 the natural gas futures contract 1 price spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of 164 per mmbtu in march 2016 to a high of 484 per mmbtu in november 2018 during 2019  wti futures contract 1 prices ranged from 4654 to 6630 per bbl and the natural gas futures contract 1 spot market price of natural gas ranged from 207 to 359 per mmbtu on january 31 2020 the wti futures contract 1 posted price for crude oil was 5156 per bbl and the natural gas futures contract 1 spot market price of natural gas was 184 per mmbtu representing decreases of 22 and 49 respectively from the high of 6630 per bbl of oil and 359 per mmbtu for natural gas during 2019  in response to recent volatility in commodity prices many producers have reduced their capital expenditure budgets if the prices of oil and natural gas decline further our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our 

reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

concerns over general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european asian and the united states financial markets have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy in addition continued hostilities in the middle east the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries and global or national health concerns could adversely affect the global economy these factors combined with volatility in commodity prices business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates may precipitate an economic slowdown concerns about global economic growth may have an adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish which could impact the price at which we can sell our production affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2019  our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 31 billion  our 2020 capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 28 billion to 30 billion  representing an increase of 1 over our 2019 capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2020 could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt 

financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

 

 

 

 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

  

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

at an assumed price of approximately 6000 per bbl wti we currently have approximately 12310 gross  8141 net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2019  only 477 of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified approximately 3382 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or 

completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business through december 31 2019  we are the operator of have participated in or have acquired a total of 1770 horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

multiwell pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results 

we utilize multiwell pad drilling where practical because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location multiwell pad drilling delays the commencement of production which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2019  we had leases representing 42421 net acres expiring in 2020  7626 net acres expiring in 2021  2387 net acres expiring in 2022  4919 net acres expiring in 2023 and no net acres expiring in 2024  the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2020  we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts doubleup swap contracts and threeway collars with corresponding put short put and call options and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional fixed price swap fixed price basis swap doubleup swap derivatives or threeway collars for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2020 and 2021 production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil 

we use fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts doubleup swap contracts and threeway collars with corresponding put short put and call options to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on nymex wti pricing the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty under our threeway collar contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the ceiling price to a maximum of the difference between the floor price and the short put price we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the ceiling price if the settlement price is between the floor and the ceiling price there is no payment required 

to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further we may not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted for additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of december 31 2019  see note 15 —derivatives to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

by using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposure to changes in commodity prices we expose ourselves to credit risk credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive the counterparty owes us which creates credit risk we do not require collateral from our counterparties we have entered into derivative instruments only with counterparties that are also lenders in our credit facility and have been deemed an acceptable credit risk by us 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to longterm crude oil agreements with trafigura plains shell and vitol under which subject to certain terms and conditions we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to such companies our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods and depends in some cases upon certain conditions such as the inservice dates for the gray oak pipeline and the epic pipeline as described in this report see “business and properties—marketing and customers” above if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements and may have an adverse effect on our company 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 186 million at december 31 2019  and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 429 million at december 31 2019  joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2019  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  27  plains  23  and vitol  15  for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  26  koch  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  31  koch  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 1354  1262 and 1111 for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 was 14 billion  595 million and 321 million  respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of 

evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

an impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties of 790 million was recorded for the year ended december 31 2019  no impairments on proved oil and natural gas properties were recorded for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 which include those attributable to viper are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities—oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe because they have become uneconomic or otherwise 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

approximately 33 of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31 2019  were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves 

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 

all of our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of december 31 2019  all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play in the midland basin this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field 

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2019  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  27  plains  23  and vitol  15  for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  26  koch  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  31  koch  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business operations have grown substantially since our initial public offering in october 2012 and we expect our business operations to continue to grow in the future as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and 

complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

  

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system which interconnects with third party pipelines our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the longterm and at the state and local levels see item 1 “business—regulation” for a description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration for a more detailed discussion of federal laws concerning hydraulic fracturing see “items 1 and 2 business and properties—regulation—regulation of hydraulic fracturing” 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 

several states including texas and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids for a more detailed discussion of state and local laws and initiatives concerning hydraulic fracturing see “items 1 and 2 business and properties—regulation—regulation of hydraulic fracturing” we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further 

regulated at the federal  state or local level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

derivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the july 2010 doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act which we refer to as doddfrank act provides for federal oversight of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission which we refer to as the cftc the sec and federal regulators of financial institutions which we refer to as the prudential regulators adopt rules or regulations implementing the doddfrank act and providing definitions of terms used in the doddfrank act the doddfrank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities 

although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act remain to be adopted the cftc the sec and the prudential regulators have issued many rules to implement the doddfrank act including a rule which we refer to as the 

mandatory clearing rule requiring clearing of hedges or swaps that are subject to it currently only certain interest rate and credit default swaps which we do not presently have a rule which we refer to as the end user exception establishing an “end user” exception to the mandatory clearing rule a rule which we refer to as the margin rule setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the margin rule for end users that are not financial end users which exception we refer to as the nonfinancial end user exception and a rule subsequently vacated by the united states district court for the district of columbia and remanded to the cftc for further proceedings imposing position limits the cftc has three times proposed a new version of this rule with respect to which the comment period closed but the rule was not adopted and another version of this rule which we refer to as the latestproposed position limit rule with respect to which the comment period will close on april 29 2020 unless extended and a final rule may or may not be issued the latestproposed position limit rule provides an exemption from the position limits for swaps that constitute “bona fide hedging positions” within the definition of such term under the latestproposed position limit rule subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the latestproposed position limit rule 

we qualify for the end user exception and will utilize it if the mandatory clearing rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate we qualify for the nonfinancial end user exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the margin rule and our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitute “bona fide hedging positions” under the reproposed position limit rule and we intend to undertake the filing recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging position exemption under the latestproposed position limit rule if and when it becomes effective so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules however most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the end user exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers major swap participants financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the nonfinancial end user exception in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations including laws and regulations giving the european union financial authorities the power to write down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations andor require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts which we refer to collectively as foreign regulations which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations which we refer to as foreign counterparties and the us adopted law and rules which we call the us resolution stay rules clarifying similar rights of us banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation the doddfrank act the rules which have been adopted and not vacated and to the extent that the latestproposed position limit rule is effected such proposed rule and the us resolution stay rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties the foreign regulations could have similar effects if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the doddfrank act and regulation the us resolution stay rules and foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the doddfrank act and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us our financial condition and our results of operations 

recently enacted us tax legislation as well as future us tax legislations may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

  

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law public law no 11597 a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act which we refer to as the tax act that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code among other changes the tax act i reduces the maximum us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 ii preserves longstanding upstream oil and gas tax provisions such as immediate deduction of intangible drilling iii allows for immediate expensing of capital expenditures for tangible personal property for a period of time iv modifies the provisions related to the limitations on deductions for executive compensation of publicly traded corporations and v enacts new limitations regarding the deductibility of interest expense the tax act is complex and farreaching and while we have evaluated the resulting impact of its enactment on us and recorded adjustments as required in our financial statements aspects of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and any such changes in our interpretations and assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

in addition from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and gas industry including i eliminating the immediate deduction for 

intangible drilling and development costs ii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures while these specific changes are not included in the tax act no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration development or similar activities could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs while we are subject to certain federal greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives for a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations see “items 1 and 2 business and properties—regulation—environmental regulation—climate change” 

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and begin negotiations to either reenter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the united states the paris agreement sets forth a specific exit process whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice on november 4 2019 the trump administration submitted its formal notification of withdrawal to the united nations it is not clear what steps if any will be taken to negotiate a new agreement or what terms would be included in such an agreement in response to the announcement many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity in addition a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states most recently in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal in response to these concerns regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells for example on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water or other oil and gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well if the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity then the agency may deny modify suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well the commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells 

we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities while these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations these legal requirements are subject to change which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements owing to among other things concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

although ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the facilities we consider to be natural gas gathering pipelines we believe that our subsidiary rattler llc’s natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that ferc has used to determine that pipelines perform primarily a gathering function and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated interstate transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress if ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate transportation service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by ferc under the nga or the natural gas policy act or ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition if any of rattler llc’s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by ferc 

even though we consider rattler llc’s natural gas gathering pipelines to be exempt from the jurisdiction of ferc under the nga ferc regulation of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines may indirectly impact gathering services ferc’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets and gathering services in recent years ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines however we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the natural gas gathering services 

natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services rattler llc’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction 

testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on our or rattler llc’s operations but we could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased operating costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs operational delays and costs of operation 

the us department of transportation or dot through the phmsa and state agencies enforces safety regulations with respect to the design construction operation maintenance inspection and management of certain of rattler llc’s pipeline facilities the phmsa requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in highconsequence areas or hcas defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage that cross a navigable waterway or that have a high population density the regulations require operators to i perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity ii identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a hca iii improve data collection integration and analysis iv repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and v implement preventive and mitigating actions these regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies the phmsa’s regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans including extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 also known as the pipeline safety and job creation act and the pipes act are the most recent enactments of federal legislation to amend the ngpsa and the hlpsa which are pipeline safety laws requiring increased safety measures for natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines among other things the pipeline safety and job creation act directs the secretary of transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements automatic or remotecontrolled valve use excess flow valve use leak detection system installation material strength testing and verification of the maximum allowable pressure of certain pipelines the pipeline safety and job creation act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from 100000 to 200000 per violation per day of violation and from 10 million to 20 million for a related series of violations effective july 31 2019 to account for inflation those maximum civil penalties were increased to 218647 per violation per day with a maximum of 2186465 for a related series of violations the pipes act ensures that the phmsa completes the pipeline safety and job creation act requirements reforms phmsa to be a more dynamic datadriven regulator and closes gaps in federal standards 

on october 1 2019 phmsa published final rules to expand its integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on regulated pipelines including certain segments outside high consequence areas the rules once effective also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated gathering lines the safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the pipeline safety and job creation act and the pipes act as well as any implementation of phmsa rules thereunder andor related rule making proceedings could require us to install new or modified safety controls pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis any or all of which tasks could result in increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our or rattler llc’s results of operations or financial position 

if third party pipelines or other facilities interconnected to rattler llc’s midstream systems become partially or fully unavailable or if the volumes we gather or treat do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities our midstream operations could be adversely affected 

our subsidiary rattler llc’s midstream systems are connected to other pipelines or facilities the majority of which are owned by third parties the continuing operation of such third party pipelines or facilities is not within our control if any of these pipelines or facilities becomes unable to transport treat or process natural gas or crude oil or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities our midstream operations could be adversely affected 

rattler llc’s rates are subject to review by federal regulators which could adversely affect our revenues 

our subsidiary rattler llc has a tariff on file with ferc to gather crude oil in interstate commerce pipelines that gather or transport crude oil for third parties in interstate commerce are among other things subject to regulation of the rates and terms and conditions of service by the ferc rattler is also subject to annual reporting requirements and may also be required to respond to requests for information from government agencies including compliance audits conducted by ferc 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time 

however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 

our business could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our activities we require continued 

access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and cash flows 

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2019  2018 and 2017  and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 we incurred 65 million  37 million and 34 million  respectively of stock based compensation expense of which we capitalized 17 million  10 million and 9 million respectively pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss 

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of its vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of its business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

references in this section to “us “we” or “our” shall mean diamondback energy inc and diamondback og llc collectively unless otherwise specified 

we have relied in the past and we may rely from time to time in the future on borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures unless we are able to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility with 

cash flow from operations and proceeds from equity or debt offerings implementing our capital programs may require an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances in addition a reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility and the inability to otherwise obtain financing for our capital programs could require us to curtail our capital expenditures 

we have historically relied on availability under our revolving credit facility to fund a portion of our capital expenditures we expect that we will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings in the past we have created availability under the revolving credit facility by repaying outstanding borrowings with the proceeds from debt or equity offerings we cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings instead we may be required or choose to finance our capital expenditures through additional debt issuances which would increase our total amount of debt outstanding if the availability under the revolving credit facility were reduced and we were otherwise unable to secure other sources of financing we may be required to curtail our capital expenditures which could limit our ability to fund our drilling activities and acquisitions or otherwise finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2019  we had total longterm debt of 54 billion  including 43 billion outstanding under our 5375 senior notes due 2025 which we refer to as the 2025 notes the energen notes our 2875 senior notes due 2024 our 3250 senior notes due 2026 and our 3500 senior notes due 2029 which are collectively referred to together with the 2025 notes as the senior notes and 13 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we had 199 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  energen one of our subsidiaries had 539 million  which are collectively referred to as the energen notes as of december 31 2019  viper llc one of our subsidiaries had 97 million in outstanding borrowings and 678 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility and 500 million outstanding under its 5375 senior notes due 2027 as of december 31 2019  rattler llc one of our subsidiaries had 424 million in outstanding borrowings and 176 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 

 

 the covenants contained in the agreements governing certain of our outstanding indebtedness will limit our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay dividends and make certain investments 

 

 

 our high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes and 

 

our high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our 

ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

certain of our debt instruments contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility we are allowed among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under our revolving credit facility we designated viper viper’s general partner viper’s subsidiary rattler rattler’s general partner and rattler’s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the revolving credit facility including the related guaranty further viper viper’s general partner viper’s subsidiaries rattler rattler’s general partner and rattler’s subsidiaries are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 

we and our subsidiaries may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants and financial covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments as an example our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a total net debt to capitalization ratio the requirement that we and our subsidiaries comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the applicable debt instrument if default occurs under our revolving credit facility the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

our indebtedness is structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries and our obligations are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries 

our senior indebtedness obligations are obligations exclusively of diamondback energy inc and diamondback og llc and not of any of our other subsidiaries none of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of our senior indebtedness any assets of our subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries and therefore the claims of our creditors including lenders under our revolving credit facility and holders of the senior notes with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries our claims would still be effectively 

subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims consequently our senior indebtedness will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as of december 31 2019  energen one of our subsidiaries had an aggregate of 539 million of notes which are collectively referred to as the energen notes as of december 31 2019  viper llc one of our subsidiaries had 97 million in outstanding borrowings and 678 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility and 500 million outstanding under its 5375 senior notes due 2027 as of december 31 2019  rattler llc one of our subsidiaries had 424 million in outstanding borrowings and 176 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations the indenture governing the 2025 notes restricts our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments 

we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends or distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us if our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend or distribution payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities and the indentures restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2019  we had 13 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we had 199 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  viper llc had 97 million in outstanding borrowings and 678 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  rattler llc had 424 million in outstanding borrowings and 176 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility further the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries’ notes allow us to issue additional notes incur certain other additional debt and to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset 

purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our viper llc’s and rattler llc’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities the terms of our and our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternate base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 0125 to 10 in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1125 to 20 in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base both viper llc’s and rattler llc’s revolving credit facilities provide for interest on borrowings at floating rates which are also tied to libor libor tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts including general shortterm interest rates rates set by the us federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions we have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt accordingly our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates as of december 31 2019  we had 13 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 320 on december 31 2019  viper llc’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 430 during the year ended december 31 2019  rattler llc’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 298 during the year ended december 31 2019  as of december 31 2019  viper llc had 97 million in outstanding borrowings and 678 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  rattler llc had 424 million in outstanding borrowings and 176 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

on july 27 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established or if libor will continue to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is considering replacing us dollar libor with a newly created index it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united states or elsewhere 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 

 

 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

in the past we have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies and may do so again in the future these transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

the declaration of dividends and repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends on or repurchases of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders 

on february 13 2018 we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018 the decision to pay any future dividends however is solely within the discretion of and subject to approval by our board of directors our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends including the record date the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination based on its evaluation of these factors the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders 

in may 2019 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 2 billion of our outstanding common stock through december 31 2020 this repurchase program is at the discretion of our board of directors and may be suspended from time to time modified extended or discontinued by our board of directors at any time 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 

if we were to experience an “ownership change” as determined under section 382 of the code our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with nols generated prior to the ownership change would be limited possibly substantially in general an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our prechange nols we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the longterm taxexempt rate in general an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more “5 shareholders” as defined in the internal revenue code at any time during a rolling threeyear period 

as of december 31 2019 we had a net operating loss or nol carry forward of approximately 17 billion for federal income tax purposes including 748 million acquired as part of the energen acquisition although the nol and tax credits of 3 million attributable to energen’s preacquisition activity are subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the code we do not expect that limitation to materially impact our utilization of those amounts 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

operational update 

our development program is focused entirely within the permian basin where we continue to focus on longlateral multiwell pad development our horizontal development consists of multiple targeted intervals primarily within the wolfcamp and spraberry formations in the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone springs formations in the delaware basin 

we are operating 23 drilling rigs now including two rigs drilling produced water disposal wells and currently intend to operate between 20 and 23 drilling rigs in 2020 on average across our asset base in the midland and delaware basins 

in the midland basin we continued to have positive results across our core development areas located within midland martin howard glasscock and andrews counties where development has primarily focused on drilling longlateral multiwell pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations 

in the delaware basin we have now drilled and completed a significant number of wells in pecos reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a which we believe has been derisked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target in 2020 we expect to focus development on these areas 

we continue to focus on low cost operations and best in class execution to combat potential fluctuation in service costs we have looked to lock in pricing for dedicated activity levels and will continue to seek opportunities to control additional well cost where possible our 2020 drilling and completion budget accounts for capital costs that we believe cover potential increases in our service costs during the year 

in 2020 we remain focused on navigating our industry challenges by staying disciplined improving our industryleading cost structure growing production increasing environmental transparency and returning more cash to our stockholders as evidenced by our quarterly dividend increase beginning with the fourth quarter of 2019

we have currently budgeted a 2020 total capital spend of 28 billion to 30 billion  consisting of 245 billion to 26 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity 200 million to 225 million for midstream investments excluding joint venture investments and 150 million to 175 million for infrastructure and other expenditures excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions we expect to drill and complete 320 to 360 gross horizontal wells in 2020  should commodity prices weaken further or remain weak for an extended period of time we intend to act responsibly and consistent with our prior practices reduce capital spending if commodity prices strengthen we intend to grow oil production within our 2020 budget and return cash to our stockholders or pay down indebtedness 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2019 and 2018 which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

in our upstream segment our main sources of revenues are the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing 

in our midstream operations segment our results are primarily driven by the volumes of crude oil that rattler gathers transports and delivers natural gas that rattler gathers compresses transports and delivers water that rattler sources transports and delivers and produced water that rattler gathers transports and disposes of and the fees rattler charges per unit of throughput for our midstream services 

the following table presents the sources of our oil and natural gas revenues for the years presented 



  

commodity prices 

since our production in our exploration and production business consists primarily of oil our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas or natural gas liquids prices viper as the owner of mineral interests is also indirectly exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices oil natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have historically been volatile lower commodity prices may not only decrease our revenues but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement which may be redetermined at the discretion of our lenders 

in our midstream operations business we have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low commodity prices may cause us or rattler’s other customers to delay drilling or shut in production which would reduce the volumes available for gathering and processing by our infrastructure assets if we or rattler’s other customers delay drilling or temporarily shut in production due to persistently low commodity prices or for any other reason our revenue in the midstream operations segment could decrease as rattler’s commercial agreements do not contain minimum volume commitments 

the following table sets forth information related to commodity prices for the following periods 



on december 31 2019  the wti futures contract 1 price for crude oil was 6106 per bbl and the natural gas futures contract 1 price was 219 per mmbtu 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating expenses these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative expenses  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

midstream services expense these are costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities 

depreciation depletion and amortization under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income expense we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions this amount reflects interest paid to our lender plus the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees net of interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of the change in the fair value of open nonhedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

deferred tax assets liabilities we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

results of operations 

for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis in our 2018 form 10k which was filed with the sec on february 25 2019 which discussion is incorporated in this report by reference from such prior report on form 10k the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 



 

production data 

substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production the following tables set forth our production data for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



comparison of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 18 billion  or 82  to 39 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 from 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2018  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 152533 boed to 282972 boed during the year ended december 31 2019 from 130439 boed during the year ended december 31 2018  the total increase in revenue of approximately 18 billion is attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes partially offset by lower average sales prices for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our 

production increased by 34151 mbbls of oil 62944 mmcf of natural gas and 11033 mbbls of natural gas liquids for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  

the net dollar effect of the change in prices of approximately 501 million calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the change in production of approximately 23 billion calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 



 

lease bonus revenue the following table shows lease bonus revenue for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

lease operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 285 million  or 043 per boe in both cases lease operating expenses increased primarily due to increased power generation costs as a result of reduced electrical availability as well as increased production and the higher cost of the central basin platform assets which were divested during 2019 we are actively working to mitigate this issue and expect these costs to decrease in the future 

production and ad valorem tax expense the following table shows production and ad valorem tax expense for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices among other factors whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices production taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 80 million due to increased overall production from acquisitions and well completions production taxes per boe for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 decreased by 040 primarily due to a higher percentage increase in production volumes as compared to production taxes ad valorem taxes for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 35 million due to the addition of acquired and completed wells from the latter half of 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

historically our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 27 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to an increase in production during the year ended december 31 2019  partially offset by lower average sales prices 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional 

and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “–sources of our revenue” and item 1a “risk factors” above

the rattler credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of 600 million  loan principal may be optionally prepaid from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage and is required to be prepaid at the maturity date of may 28 2024 the rattler credit agreement is guaranteed by rattler tall city rattler omog llc and rattler ajax processing llc and is secured by substantially all of the assets of rattler llc rattler tall city rattler omog llc and rattler ajax processing llc as of december 31 2019  rattler llc had 424 million of outstanding borrowings and 176 million available for future borrowings under the rattler credit agreement 

the outstanding borrowings under the rattler credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by rattler llc that is based on the prime rate or libor in each case plus an applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 0250 to 1250 per annum for primebased loans and 1250 to 2250 per annum for libor loans in each case depending on the consolidated total leverage ratio as defined in the rattler credit agreement rattler llc is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0250 to 0375 per annum on the unused portion of the commitment which fee is also dependent on the consolidated total leverage ratio 

the rattler credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants these covenants among other things limit additional indebtedness additional liens sales of assets mergers and consolidations distributions and other restricted payments transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements in each case of rattler rattler llc and their restricted subsidiaries the covenants are subject to exceptions set forth in the rattler credit agreement including an exception allowing rattler llc or rattler to issue unsecured debt securities and an exception allowing payment of distributions if no default or events of default exists 

the rattler credit agreement also contains financial maintenance covenants that require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below 



for purposes of calculating the financial maintenance covenants prior to the fiscal quarter ending june 30 2020 ebitda as defined in the rattler credit agreement will be annualized based on the actual ebitda for the preceding fiscal quarters starting with the fiscal quarter ending september 30 2019 

as of december 31 2019  rattler and rattler llc were in compliance with all financial covenants under the rattler credit agreement the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under the rattler credit agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default the rattler credit agreement contains customary events of default including nonpayment breach of covenants materially incorrect representations crossdefault bankruptcy and change in control 

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2020 capital budget for drilling midstream and infrastructure of 28 billion to 30 billion  representing an increase of 1 over our 2019 capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2019  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were 27 billion  we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted during the year ended december 31 2019  we spent approximately 443 million in cash on acquisitions of leasehold interests and mineral acres 

in may 2019 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 2 billion of our outstanding common stock through december 31 2020 we repurchased approximately 598 million of our common stock under this program during the year ended december 31 2019  with approximately 14 billion remaining available for future repurchases under this program we intend to continue to purchase shares under the repurchase program opportunistically with available funds primarily from cash flow from operations and liquidity events such as the sale of assets while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our capital expenditure programs 

the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners we are currently operating 23 drilling rigs including two rigs drilling produced water disposal wells and nine completion crews we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions 

based upon current oil and natural gas prices and production expectations for 2020 we believe that our cash flow from operations cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2020 however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2020 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to the results of our drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves if there is a decline in commodity prices our revenues cash flows results of operations liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019  





 

the table above does not include estimated deficiency fees related to certain volume commitments that we have as they are based off future volume deliveries and differences from market pricing which we cannot predict 

critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 2 —summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities equitybased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

revenue from contracts with customers 

sales of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids are recognized at the point control of the product is transferred to the customer virtually all of the pricing provisions in our contracts are tied to a market index with certain adjustments based on among other factors whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line the quality of the oil or natural gas and the prevailing supply and demand conditions as a result the price of the oil natural gas and natural gas liquids fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil natural gas and natural gas liquids supplies 

oil sales 

our oil sales contracts are generally structured where it delivers oil to the purchaser at a contractually agreedupon delivery point at which the purchaser takes custody title and risk of loss of the product under this arrangement we or a third party transports the product to the delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser with no deduction in this scenario we recognize revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the price received from the purchaser oil revenues are recorded net of any thirdparty transportation fees and other applicable differentials in our consolidated statements of operations 

natural gas and natural gas liquids sales 

under our natural gas processing contracts it delivers natural gas to a midstream processing entity at the wellhead battery facilities or the inlet of the midstream processing entity’s system the midstream processing entity gathers and processes the natural gas and remits proceeds to us for the resulting sales of natural gas liquids and residue gas in these scenarios we evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent in the transaction for those contracts where we have concluded it is the principal and the ultimate third party is its customer we recognize revenue on a gross basis with transportation gathering processing treating and compression fees presented as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

in certain natural gas processing agreements we may elect to take its residue gas andor natural gas liquids inkind at the tailgate of the midstream entity’s processing plant and subsequently market the product through the marketing process we deliver product to the ultimate thirdparty purchaser at a contractually agreedupon delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser in this scenario we recognize revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the index price received from the purchaser the gathering processing treating and compression fees attributable to the gas processing contract as well as any transportation fees incurred to deliver the product to the purchaser are presented as transportation gathering processing treating and compression expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

midstream revenue 

substantially all revenues from gathering compression water handling disposal and treatment operations are derived from intersegment transactions for services rattler provides to exploration and production operations the portion of such fees shown in our consolidated financial statements represent amounts charged to interest owners in our operated wells as well as fees charged to other third parties for water handling and treatment services provided by rattler or usage of rattler’s gathering and compression systems for gathering and compression revenue rattler satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue when low pressure volumes are delivered to a specified delivery point revenue is recognized based on the per mmbtu gathering fee or a per barrel gathering fee charged by rattler in accordance with the gathering and compression agreement for water handling and treatment revenue rattler satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the water volumes have been delivered to the fracwater meter for a specified well pad and the wastewater volumes have been metered downstream of our facilities for services contracted through third party providers rattler’s performance obligation is satisfied when the service performed by the third party provider has been completed revenue is recognized based on the per barrel water delivery or a wastewater gathering and disposal fee charged by rattler in accordance with the water services agreement 

transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations 

our upstream product sales contracts do not originate until production occurs and therefore are not considered to exist beyond each days’ production therefore there are no remaining performance obligations under any of our product sales contracts 

the majority of our midstream revenue agreements have a term greater than one year and as such we have utilized the practical expedient in asc 606 which states that we are not required to disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation under our revenue agreements each delivery generally represents a separate performance obligation therefore future volumes delivered are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required 

the remainder of our midstream revenue agreements which relate to agreements with third parties are shortterm in nature with a term of one year or less we have utilized an additional practical expedient in asc 606 which exempts it from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of an agreement that has an original expected duration of one year or less 

contract balances 

under our product sales contracts we have the right to invoice our customers once the performance obligations have been satisfied at which point payment is unconditional accordingly our product sales contracts do not give rise to contract assets or liabilities under asc 606 

priorperiod performance obligations 

we record revenue in the month production is delivered to the purchaser however settlement statements for certain natural gas and natural gas liquids sales may not be received for 30 to 90 days after the date production is delivered and as a result we are required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that will be received for the sale of the product we record the differences between our estimates and the actual amounts received for product sales in the month that payment is received from the purchaser we have existing internal controls for our revenue estimation process and related accruals and any identified differences between our revenue estimates and actual revenue received historically have not been significant for the year ended december 31 2019  revenue recognized in the reporting period related to performance obligations satisfied in prior reporting periods was not material we believe that the pricing provisions of our oil natural gas and natural gas liquids contracts are customary in the industry to the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas sales are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties the revenue related to expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded 

impairment 

we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under this method all acquisition exploration and development costs including certain internal costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence 

of proved reserves the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three to five years sales of oil and natural gas properties whether or not being amortized currently are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas 

under this method of accounting we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter the test determines a limit or ceiling on the book value of the proved oil and natural gas properties net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum from proved reserves based on the trailing 12month unweighted average of the firstdayofthemonth price adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet b the cost of properties not being amortized if any and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties if the net book value including related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling an impairment or noncash writedown is required 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 

accounting for equitybased compensation 

we grant various types of equitybased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 12 —equitybased compensation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form 10k stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 —summary of significant accounting policies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2019  please read note 18 —commitments and contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives including basis swaps doubleup swaps put spreads interest rate swaps and threeway collars to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on nymex west texas intermediate pricing cushing and magellan east houston and crude oil  brent and with natural gas derivative settlements based on nymex henry hub and waha hub pricing 

at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  we had a net asset derivative position of 26 million and 216 million  respectively related to our price swap price basis swap derivatives and threeway collars utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps and fixed price basis swaps as of december 31 2019  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position to a net liability position of 178 million  a decrease of 204 million  while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position to 232 million  an increase of 206 million  however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 186 million at december 31 2019  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 429 million at december 31 2019  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2019  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  27  plains  23  and vitol  15  for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  26  koch  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell  31  koch  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2019  we had 15 customers that represented approximately 80 of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2018  we had four customer that represented approximately 82 of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by us that is equal an alternate base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 0125 to 10 per annum and from 1125 to 20 per annum in the case of libor in each case depending on the pricing level which in turn depends on the rating agencies’ rating of our unsecured debt we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0125 to 0350 per year on the unused portion of the commitment based on the pricing level which in turn depends on the rating agencies’ rating of our unsecured debt 

as of december 31 2019  we had 13 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 320 on december 31 2019  an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in our interest expense of approximately 130000 based on the 13 million outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility as of such date 

as of december 31 2019  viper llc had 97 million in outstanding borrowings viper llc’s weighted average interest rate was 430  an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in viper llc’s interest expense of approximately 1 million based on the 97 million outstanding in the aggregate under the viper credit agreement on december 31 2019  

as of december 31 2019  rattler llc had 424 million of outstanding borrowings rattler llc’s weighted average interest rate was 298  an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in rattler llc’s interest expense of approximately 4 million based on the 424 million outstanding under the rattler credit agreement as of december 31 2019

severance benefits related to a change in control  in the event that employment of a participant is terminated by us other than for “cause” and not by reason of death or disability or if the participant terminates his or her employment for “good reason” in either case within the two year period immediately following a change in control as defined in the severance plan the participant will be entitled to the benefits described above except that the salary continuation described in clause ii will be replaced by a lump sum cash payment equal to a multiple of the participant’s base salary plus such participant’s average bonus for the preceding three years 30x for the chief executive officer 25x for executive vicepresidents 225x for senior vicepresidents and 20x for vicepresidents 

severance benefits related to death or disability  the severance plan also provides the same benefits described in clauses i ii and iii but not clause iv in the event that a participant dies or becomes disabled as defined in the severance agreement while employed by us mr stice’s participation agreement includes terms that are intended to maintain certain benefits under his prior employment agreement and are consistent with prior public disclosure that require the company to pay 100 percent of the premiums to continue his his spouse’s and any of his eligible dependents’ group health plan continuation coverage under cobra 

release and restrictive covenants  the payment of any benefits under the severance plan is conditioned on the participant’s or if applicable the participant’s personal representative’s or estate’s execution of a general release of claims the severance plan also includes certain restrictive covenants that continue beyond the employment period including noncompetition and nonsolicitation obligations for a period of one year following termination of employment if a participating executive terminates employment on a basis that is not eligible for severance benefits we can elect to apply the restrictive covenants for up to 12 months and receive a release by payment of an amount equal to onetwelfth of the participant’s annualized base salary plus target annual bonus for each month the restrictive covenants will apply 

we believe that these severance benefits provide the same type of income transition protections that were provided to our executives under their prior employment agreements these arrangements are intended to attract and retain qualified executives that could have job alternatives that may appear to them to be less risky absent these arrangements we believe that the enhanced severance benefits resulting from terminations related to a change in control transaction are in the interest of our stockholders because they provide an incentive for executives to continue to help successfully execute such a transaction from its early stages through consummation we also believe that these benefits provide important protection to our named executive officers are consistent with the prior employment protections and the practices of peer group companies and are appropriate for the attraction and retention of executive talent 

appointment of executive vice presidentoperations 

on february 20 2020 our board of directors promoted daniel n wesson to serve as our executive vice presidentoperations effective march 1 2020 until the effective date of this promotion mr wesson will continue to serve as our senior vice president of operations a position he has held since february 2019 mr wesson served as our vice president of operations from april 2017 to february 2019 and as our completions manager from january 2013 to april 2017 he joined us as an operations engineer in february 2012 before joining our company mr wesson served in various operations and engineering roles for bopco lp from 2010 to 2012 and conocophillips from 2007 to 2010 mr wesson received his bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from louisiana state university and is a member of the permian basin society of petroleum engineers 

in his role as our executive vice presidentoperations mr wesson is entitled to receive an annual base salary and participate in i our annual executive cash incentive program which provides an opportunity to receive an annual bonus based on a target percentage of the annual base salary and preestablished performance goals ii our equity incentive plan under which we grant annual performancebased and timevesting equity awards iii the severance plan described above and iv any other employee benefit plans generally available to similarly situated employees of our company as in effect from time to time

 item 1 business and properties 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174  net acres in the permian basin at december 31 2018  our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 604367  gross  461218  net acres which consisted primarily of approximately 231100  gross  194661  net acres in the midland basin and approximately 232143  gross  170205  net acres in the delaware basin in addition we through our publicly traded subsidiary viper energy partners lp which we refer to as viper or the partnership own mineral interests underlying approximately 532295  gross acres and 14841  net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale approximately 37  of these net royalty acres are operated by us we own viper energy partners gp llc the general partner of viper which we refer to as the general partner and we own approximately 59  of the limited partner interest in viper 

our activities are primarily focused on horizontal development of the spraberry and wolfcamp formations of the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations of the delaware basin both of which are part of the larger permian basin in west texas and new mexico the permian basin is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates 

as of december 31 2018  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 992001  mboe which includes estimated reserves of 63136  mboe attributable to the mineral interests owned by viper based on reserve reports prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 65  are classified as proved developed producing proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 416  gross  374  net horizontal well locations in which we have a working interest and 25  horizontal wells in which we own only a mineral interest through our subsidiary viper as of december 31 2018  our estimated proved reserves were approximately 63  oil 18  natural gas liquids and 19  natural gas 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data we currently have approximately 11868  gross  7633  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately 6000  per bbl wti we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves

our properties 

location and land 

our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 604367  gross  461218  net acres which consisted primarily of approximately 231100  gross  194661  net acres in the midland basin and approximately 232143  gross  170205  net acres in the delaware basin at december 31 2018  we are the operator of approximately 89  of this permian basin acreage in addition we through our subsidiary viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 532295  gross acres and 14841  net royalty acres in the permian basin and eagle ford shale approximately 37  of these net royalty acres are operated by us the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry bone spring wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play since then we and most other operators are almost exclusively drilling horizontal wells in the development of unconventional reservoirs in the permian basin as of december 31 2018  we held working interests in 7279  gross  4678  net producing wells and only royalty interests in 2645  additional wells 

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid pennsylvanianpermian subsidence in response to dynamic structural influence it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us with established oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations time equivalent in the delaware basin the “wolfbone” play describes vertically commingled production from the permian bone spring and wolfcamp formations 

the spraberrybone spring was deposited as siliciclastic turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberrybone spring and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the shales themselves and in the more conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs between the shales the wolfberry and wolfbone are unconventional “basincentered oil” resource plays in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

  

we have successfully developed several shale intervals within the clearfork spraberrybone spring and wolfcamp formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the shales exhibit low permeabilities which necessitate the need for hydraulic fracture stimulation to unlock the vast storage of hydrocarbons in these targets 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 2617  square miles of 3d data this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling program and identification of additional resource to be exploited 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2018  net production from our permian basin acreage was 47610  mboe or an average of 130439  boed of which approximately 72  was oil 16  was natural gas liquids and 12  was natural gas 

facilities 

our oil and natural gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilnatural gaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

  

recent and future activity 

during 2019  we expect to complete an estimated 290  to 320  gross  255  to 280  net operated horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2019  for drilling and infrastructure will be between 27 billion  and 30 billion  consisting of 23 billion  to 255 billion  for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity 4000 million  to 4500 million  for midstream and infrastructure investments excluding equity investments in longhaul pipelines or the cost of any leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2018  we drilled 189  gross  168  net and completed 176  gross  155  net operated horizontal wells during the year ended december 31 2018  our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells were 14 billion  in addition we spent 3064 million  for oil and gas midstream and infrastructure and 18 billion  for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

we are operating 21 rigs now and currently intend to operate between 18 and 22 rigs in 2019 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2018  were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 87 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 13 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our executive vice president–reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our executive vice president–reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 19  years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 



 

the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“risk factors” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2018  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 223885  mbbls of oil 343565  mmcf of natural gas and 64782  mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 345928  mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2018  



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to purchases of 165426  mboe mostly from the acquisition of energen extensions contributed 111020  mboe from 138  gross  122  net wells in which we have a working interest and 13674  mboe from 138  gross wells in which viper owns royalty interests of the 138  gross working interest wells 38  were in the delaware basin transfers of 71435  mboe were the result of drilling or participating in 89  gross  79  net horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 49  gross wells in which we have a royalty interest or mineral interest through viper we own a working interest in 45  of the 49  gross viper wells upward revisions of 338  mboe resulted from commodity price improvement and type curve performance 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 4931 million  during 2018  estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 12017 million  in 2019  11214 million  in 2020  4351 million  in 2021  and 1270 million  in 2022  since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

as of december 31 2018  all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five  years from the date they were initially recorded 

as of december 31 2018  less than 10  of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and natural gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 



 

productive wells 

as of december 31 2018  we owned an average unweighted 64  working interest in 7279  gross  4678  net productive wells and an average 05  royalty interest in 2645  additional wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average unweighted 43  royalty or mineral interest in 3448  productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2018  relating to our leasehold acreage 



 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2018  that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   26  koch supply  trading lp  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc   11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

agreement with trafigura trading llc 

we have entered into a firm commitment oil purchase agreement with trafigura trading llc which we refer to as trafigura in which we agreed to sell and deliver an average of 25000 barrels per day of midland sweet crude oil wti to trafigura during the term of the agreement under this agreement which has a sevenyear term beginning on august 1 2018 the price per barrel of oil paid to us by trafigura is based on the average of the published settlement quotations for nymex cma as adjusted for different delivery methods and periods if during the term of the agreement we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil for any month other than for specified force majeure events we have agreed to pay trafigura a deficiency payment equal to any unfavorable difference between the contract price and the spot price multiplied by the deficiency volume 

agreement with shell trading us company 

we were party to a fiveyear oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company that expired on september 30 2018 in december 2018 we entered into a new oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company in which shell trading us company agreed to transport crude petroleum it purchases from us through the epic crude pipeline with which we have an agreement for the transportation of a maximum quantity of 50000 barrels of crude petroleum per day our agreement with shell trading us company provides for different purchase obligations during the precommencement and service commencement periods for the epic crude pipeline and provides for a threeyear term beginning on the service commencement date for the epic crude pipeline shell trading us company has the option to extend its purchase obligations for up to two oneyear terms our delivery obligations during the precommencement terms range from 30000 to 40000 barrels per day and during the full service term our maximum delivery obligation is 50000 barrels per day determined based on the amount of crude petroleum we are obligated to transport on the epic crude pipeline under our transportation agreement with such pipeline during different precommencement periods shell trading us company has agreed to pay us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the nymex over the onemonth period subject to agreed adjustments or a specified price during the full service term the price per barrel of oil payable by shell trading us company to us is subject to negotiation 

agreement with vitol inc 

we have also entered into an oil purchase agreement with vitol inc which we refer to as vitol the agreement provides for different delivery obligations before and after the gray oak pipeline is in full service ranging from 23750 barrels per day during the period from november 1 2018 to september 30 2019 to 50000 barrels per day up to a maximum of 100000 barrels per day once the gray oak pipeline is in full service determined based on the amount of crude petroleum we are obligated to transport on the gray oak pipeline under our transportation agreement with such pipeline the agreement with vitol provides for a sevenyear term commencing on the date when the gray oak pipeline is in full service the agreement contemplates variable prices depending on the delivery periods specified in the agreement the agreement also provides for a fiveyear term commencing on the date the epic crude pipeline is ready to perform transportation services from the epic midway terminal during which we agreed to sell crude petroleum to vitol opportunistically at negotiated prices if we fail to deliver any required quantities of oil for any month other than for specified force majeure events we have agreed to pay vitol a deficiency payment equal to any unfavorable difference between the contract price and the price paid by vitol to third parties to replace the deficiency quantity multiplied by the deficiency quantity subject to certain other adjustments

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production in the midland basin is transported to purchasers by pipeline during 2019 several oil and saltwater disposal gathering systems were installed we believe that these gathering systems will help us reduce our lease operating expense and improve our margins on sales in future periods 

the following table presents the average percentage of produced oil sold by pipeline and the average percentage of produced water connected to saltwater disposals by pipeline 



oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1250  to 3000  resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 7000  to 8750  

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our o il and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from  our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is often strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our  operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling   the resource conservation and recovery act as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with 

the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” also in december 2016 the epa agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste it has until march 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses   

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released   

water discharges   the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit on june 29 2015 the epa and the us army corps of engineers or the corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the clean water act the rules are subject to ongoing litigation and have been stayed in more than half the states including texas also on december 11 2018 the epa and the corps released a proposed rule that would replace the 2015 rule and significantly reduce the waters subject to federal regulation under the clean water act such proposal is currently subject to public review and comment after which additional legal challenges are anticipated as a result of such recent developments substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the clean water act to the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the clean water act’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas 

the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions   

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the oil pollution act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the 

requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the oil pollution act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters   

noncompliance with the clean water act or the oil pollution act may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations  we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions   the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” also on may 12 2016 the epa issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects   

climate change in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes in may 2010 the epa adopted regulations establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration or psd and title v programs of the clean air act on june 23 2014 in utility air regulatory group v epa  the supreme court held that stationary sources could not become subject to psd or title v permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions the court ruled however that the epa may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the psd and title v programs on august 26 2016 the epa proposed changes needed to bring the epa’s air permitting regulations in line with the supreme court’s decision on greenhouse gas permitting the proposed rule was published in the federal register on october 3 2016 and the public comment period closed on december 2 2016 

additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in november 2010 the epa expanded the greenhouse gas reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing transmission storage and distribution facilities which may include certain of our facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 in october 2015 the epa amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from gathering and boosting systems completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines   

as a result of this continued regulatory focus future greenhouse gas regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions    

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and begin negotiations to either reenter or negotiate an entirely 

new agreement with more favorable terms for the united states the paris agreement sets forth a specific exit process whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice it is not clear what steps the trump administration plans to take to withdraw from the paris agreement whether a new agreement can be negotiated or what terms would be included in such an agreement furthermore in response to the announcement many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business   

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015  the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will 

likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration   in particular on may 12 2016 the epa amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new modified and reconstructed equipment processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector however in a march 28 2017 executive order president trump directed the epa to review the 2016 regulations and if appropriate to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production on june 16 2017 the epa published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations including fugitive emission requirements also on october 15 2018 the epa published a proposed rule to significantly reduce regulatory burdens imposed by the 2016 regulations including for example reducing the monitoring frequency for fugitive emissions and revising the requirements for pneumatic pumps at well sites the above standards to the extent implemented as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards   andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids   the texas legislature adopted legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process   the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells   

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases  our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production   

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas   

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices   

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas  we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill   

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas  where we operate although the corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements   

natural gas sales and transportation   historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price  of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal 

of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales ” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties   

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that  we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities   

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services are provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our   costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations   

natural gas gathering although ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the facilities we consider to be natural gas gathering pipelines we believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that ferc has used to determine that pipelines perform primarily a gathering function and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated interstate transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress if ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility or services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of 1938 or nga and that the facility provides interstate transportation service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by ferc under the nga or the natural gas policy act or ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by ferc 

even though we consider our natural gas gathering pipelines to be exempt from the jurisdiction of ferc under the nga ferc regulation of interstate natural gas transportation pipelines may indirectly impact gathering services ferc’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets and gathering services in recent years ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines however we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the natural gas gathering services 

natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services our gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on our operations but we could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased operating costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

oil sales and transportation   sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future   

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and our subsidiary rattler midstream operating llc has a tariff on file with ferc to perform gathering service in interstate commerce intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline 

rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors   

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines including our subsidiary rattler midstream operating llc must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to  us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation   texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations  we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us   

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 711  full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in birmingham alabama houston texas midland texas and oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations

 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business and properties” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risk related to our recently completed merger with energen 

the integration of energen’s business into our business may not be as successful as anticipated and we may not achieve the intended benefits of the merger or do so within the intended timeframe 

we completed the merger with energen on november 29 2018 the merger involves numerous operational strategic financial accounting legal tax and other risks including potential liabilities associated with the acquired business difficulties in integrating energen’s business into our business and our ability to manage the combined company may result in the combined company performing differently than expected in operational challenges or in the delay or failure to realize anticipated expenserelated efficiencies and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include among other factors 



 additionally the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and energen’s businesses including operational and other synergies that we believe the combined company will achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee 

our results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the merger 

following the merger the size of our business increased significantly beyond the former size of our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage this expanded business which poses numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate the operations and business of energen into our business in an efficient and timely manner to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers vendors and business partners failure to successfully manage the combined company may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market by former energen shareholders or otherwise could depress our common stock price 

our stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in the additional operations of the combined company or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all of their interests in the combined company and as a result may seek to sell their shares of our common stock shares of our common stock that were issued to the former holders of energen common stock in the merger are freely tradable by such stockholders without restrictions or further registration under the securities act of 1933 which we refer to as the securities act provided however that any stockholders who are our affiliates will be subject to the resale restrictions of rule 144 under the securities act these sales or the perception that these sales may occur coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock may affect the market for and the market price of our common stock in an adverse manner in the merger we issued approximately 628 million  shares of our common stock to energen shareholders as of february 15 2019 we had approximately 164381522  shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 77659 shares of common stock subject to unvested restricted stock units outstanding 

if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following the market price of our common stock may decrease these sales might also make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling equity or equityrelated securities at a time and price that it otherwise would deem appropriate 

the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and may decline if the benefits of the merger do not meet the expectations of financial analysts 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly following the merger including if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or the effect of the merger on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts if the price of our common stock decreases our stockholders will lose some or all of the value of their investment in our common stock in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which if they continue to occur could have a material adverse effect on the market for or liquidity of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 

in connection with the merger we incorporated energen’s hedging activities into our business we will bear all of the economic impact of such hedges and may be exposed to additional commodity price risks arising from such hedges actual crude oil natural gas and natural gas liquids prices may differ from the combined company’s expectations and as a result such hedges could have a negative impact on our business 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during the past five years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of  2619 per barrel or bbl in february 2016 to a high of 10795 per bbl in june 2014 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of   149  per mmbtu in march 2016  to a high of 815 per mmbtu in february 2014 during 2018  wti prices ranged from   4448  to 7741   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from   249  to 624   per mmbtu on   january 28 2019  the wti posted price for crude oil was   5179   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 305  per mmbtu representing decreases  of 33  and 51  respectively from the high of 7741  per bbl of oil and 624  per mmbtu for natural gas during 2018  in response to recent declines in commodity prices many producers have reduced their capital expenditure budgets if the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

concerns over general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european asian and the united states financial markets have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the global economy these factors combined with volatility in commodity prices business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates may precipitate an economic slowdown concerns about global economic growth may have an adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish which could impact the price at which we can sell our production affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2018  our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 33 billion  our 2019  capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 27 billion  to 30 billion  representing an increase  of 85  over our 2018  capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2019  could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production 

revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

 

 

 

 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

  

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact 

our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities   

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations   

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

at an assumed price of approximately 6000  per bbl wti we currently have approximately 11868  gross  7633  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2018  only 416  of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified approximately 3195  horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business through december 31 2018  we are the operator of have participated in or have 

acquired a total of 1465  horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

multiwell pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results 

we utilize multiwell pad drilling where practical because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location multiwell pad drilling delays the commencement of production which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2018  we had leases representing 37536  net acres expiring in 2019  27690  net acres expiring in 2020  6867  net acres expiring in 2021  254  net acres expiring in 2022  and no  net acres expiring in 2023  the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2019  we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional fixed price swap fixed price basis swap derivatives or costless collars for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2018 and 2019 production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil 

we use fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on nymex wti pricing the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty under the company’s costless collar contracts we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the call option price the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the put option price these contracts and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 

as of december 31 2018  we had the following commodity contracts in place covering nymex wti cushing and magellan east houston crude oil brent crude oil and nymex henry hub and waha hub natural gas for the production period of january 2019  through december 2019  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have crude oil basis swap contracts priced at a weighted average price of 121  wti for 15120000  aggregate bbls with a production period of january 2020  through december 2020  to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further we will not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to longterm agreements with trafigura shell trading us company and vitol under which we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to such companies our maximum delivery obligation under these agreements varies for different periods ranging from 23750 barrels of oil per day to up to a maximum of 50000 barrels of oil per day see “business and properties—marketing and customers” above if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under the oil purchase agreement which may result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 955 million  at december 31 2018  and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 2965 million  at december 31 2018  joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   26  koch supply  trading lp  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc   11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value   

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized  we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves  the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 1262  1111  and 1123  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was 5948 million  3219 million  and 1764 million  respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense  beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

 no impairments on proved oil and natural gas properties were recorded for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  an impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties of 2455 million  was recorded for the years ended december 31 2016  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations–critical accounting policies and estimates–method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves  and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves   

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves  as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  which include those attributable to viper are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates  reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities–oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future   

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe because they have become uneconomic or otherwise   

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate   

approximately   35   of our total estimated proved reserves as of   december 31 2018  were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves   

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area   

all of our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of   december 31 2018  all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play in the midland basin this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field   

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   26  koch supply  trading lp  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc   11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business operations have grown substantially since our initial public offering in october 2012 and we expect our business operations to continue to grow in the future as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas   

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations  and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

  

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system which interconnects with third party pipelines our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge 

permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the longterm and at the state and local levels see item 1 “business–regulation” for a description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act   

in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015   the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration    

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids    for a more detailed discussion of state and local laws and initiatives concerning hydraulic fracturing see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–regulation of hydraulic fracturing”   

we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing   

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the commodities futures trading commission’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the commodities futures trading commission to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the commodities futures trading commission has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the commodities futures trading commission will finalize certain other related rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

recently enacted us tax legislation as well as future us tax legislations may adversely affect our   business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

  

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law public law no 11597 a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs ac which we refer to as the tax act that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code among other changes the tax act i reduces the maximum us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 ii preserves longstanding upstream oil and gas tax provisions such as immediate deduction of intangible drilling iii allows for immediate expensing of capital expenditures for tangible personal property for a period of time iv modifies the provisions related to the limitations on deductions for executive compensation of publicly traded corporations and v enacts new limitations regarding the deductibility of interest expense the tax act is complex and farreaching and while we have evaluated the resulting impact of its enactment on us and recorded adjustments as required in our financial statements aspects of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and any such changes in our interpretations and assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

in addition from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and gas industry including i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures while these specific changes 

are not included in the tax act no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration development or similar activities could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs while we are subject to certain federal greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives for a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–environmental regulationclimate change”   

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and begin negotiations to either reenter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the united states the paris agreement sets forth a specific exit process whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice it is not clear what steps the trump administration plans to take to withdraw from the paris agreement whether a new agreement can be negotiated or what terms would be included in such an agreement furthermore in response to the announcement many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business   

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity in addition a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states most recently in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal in response to these concerns regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells for example on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water or other oil and gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well if the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity then the agency may deny modify suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well the commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells 

we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities while these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations these legal requirements are subject to change which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements owing to among other things concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore are exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the natural gas act of 1938 however the distinction between ferc–regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

rattler midstream operating llc’s rates are subject to review by federal regulators which could adversely affect our revenues 

our subsidiary rattler midstream operating llc has a tariff on file with ferc to gather crude oil in interstate commerce pipelines that gather or transport crude oil for third parties in interstate commerce are among other things subject to regulation of the rates and terms and conditions of service by the ferc rattler is also subject to annual reporting requirements and may also be required to respond to requests for information from government agencies including compliance audits conducted by ferc 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices 

for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed   

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to 

discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties   

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations   

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical   

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry   

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies  as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations   could be materially and adversely affected   

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business   

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations  we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results   

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2018  2017  and 2016  and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we incurred 368 million  342 million  and 335 million  respectively of stock based compensation expense of which we capitalized 100 million  86 million  and 71 million  respectively pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely 

affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business   

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and   our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all   

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss   

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of its vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of its business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business   

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness 

as of december 31 2018  we had total longterm debt of 45 billion  including 21 billion  outstanding under our 4750  senior notes due 2024 which we refer to as the 2024 notes our 5375  senior notes due 2025 which we refer to as the 2025 notes and an aggregate of 5300 million  of notes issued by energen which became our wholly owned subsidiary at the effective time of the merger which notes remained outstanding following the closing of the merger and are collectively referred to as the energen notes and we had an unused borrowing base availability of 05 billion  under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  viper one of our subsidiaries had 4110 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1440 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility the indentures governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering on june 23 2014 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which modified certain provisions of our revolving credit facility to allow us among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under the amended revolving credit facility we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the amended revolving credit facility including the related guaranty and all liens on the assets of and the equity interests in viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary under the amended revolving credit facility were automatically released further viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiaries viper energy partners llc and rattler midstream operating llc formerly known as rattler midstream llc are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 

we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility if default occurs the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 

availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of 265 billion  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 20 billion  the borrowing base is subject to scheduled annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors as of december 31 2018  we had 15 billion  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility of which approximately 5590 million  was used by us to repay in full all borrowings under energen’s credit facility outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 410  on december 31 2018  we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow further if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination we would be required to repay the excess we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing we may have to sell significant assets any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance 

our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2018  our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at 265 billion  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 20 billion  and we had 15 billion  of outstanding borrowings under this facility of which approximately 5590 million  was used by us to repay in full all borrowings under energen’s credit facility outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger as of december 31 2018  viper had 4110 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1440 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility further the indentures governing the senior notes allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors the indentures governing the senior notes also allow us to incur certain other additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our and viper’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 025  to 125  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 125  to 225  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2018  we had 15 billion  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 410  on december 31 2018  viper’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 434  during the year ended december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  viper had 4110 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1440 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 

 

 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

in the past we have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies and may do so again in the future these transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

the declaration of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders 

on february 13 2018 we initiated payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock payable beginning with the first quarter of 2018 the decision to pay any future dividends however is solely within the discretion of and subject to approval by our board of directors our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends including the 

record date the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination based on its evaluation of these factors the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 

if we were to experience an “ownership change” as determined under section 382 of the code our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with nols generated prior to the ownership change would be limited possibly substantially in general an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our prechange nols we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the longterm taxexempt rate in general an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more “5 shareholders” as defined in the internal revenue code at any time during a rolling threeyear period 

as of december 31 2018  we had a net operating loss or nol carry forward of approximately 5678 million  for federal income tax purposes including 586 million  acquired as part of the energen acquisition these acquired nols as well as 28 million  in tax credits acquired from energen are subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the code 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception covenants contained in our revolving credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends on our common stock see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations–liquidity and capital resources–credit facility” 

on february 13 2018 we announced the initiation of an annual cash dividend in the amount of 050 per share of our common stock payable quarterly which began with the first quarter of 2018 the decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the discretion of and subject to approval by our board of directors our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends including the record date the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination 

recent sales of unregistered securities 

on october 31 2018 we issued approximately 26 million shares of our common stock to ajax and certain other holders as part of the consideration for the ajax acquisition these shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act provided by section 4a2 of the securities act as sales by an issuer not involving any public offering in connection with the closing of the ajax acquisition on october 31 2018 we entered into a registration rights agreement with ajax and certain other holders of our common stock pursuant to which we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to facilitate the resale of common stock issued in the ajax acquisition the shelf registration statement became automatically effective on november 30 2018 pursuant to this registration rights agreement we also agreed to provide certain demand and piggyback registration rights to such holders

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10–k the following discussion contains “forwardlooking statements” that reflect our future plans estimates beliefs and expected performance actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors see item 1a “risk factors” and “cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements” 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the wolfcamp and spraberry formations in the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in the delaware basin we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multiyear inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production 

the following table sets forth our production data for the periods indicated 



on december 31 2018  our acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 604367  gross  461218  net acres which consisted primarily of approximately 231100  gross  194661  net acres in the midland basin and approximately 232143  gross  170205  net acres in the delaware basin 

2018 was another transformational year for us we successfully closed three acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2018  including our acquisition of energen corporation or energen which acquisitions on a combined basis almost doubled our core acreage position during the same period oil prices declined dramatically and we quickly addressed the issue by announcing a reduction in activity levels in late 2018 and acting on that plan immediately in 2019 at current commodity prices we expect to grow production by over 27 year over year within cash flow in 2019 while increasing our dividend by 50 beginning with the first quarter of 2019 by remaining focused on corporate returns and prudent capital allocation we believe that in the current commodity price environment we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow while continuing to grow production at industry leading rates in 2020 and beyond we are operating 21 rigs now and currently intend to operate between 18 and 22 rigs in 2019 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions

operational update 

we are operating 21 rigs now and currently intend to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs in 2019 across our asset base in the midland and delaware basins 

in the midland basin we continue have positive results across our core development areas located within midland martin howard glasscock and andrews counties where development has primarily focused on drilling longlateral multiwell pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations 

in the delaware basin we have now drilled and completed multiple wells in pecos reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a which we believe has been derisked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target in 2019 we expect to focus development on these areas as well as our northern delaware basin acreage acquired in the energen transaction 

we continue to focus on low cost operations and best in class execution to combat rising service costs we have looked to lock in pricing for dedicated activity levels and will continue to seek opportunities to control additional well cost where possible our 2019 drilling and completion budget accounts for capital costs that we believe will cover potential increases in our service costs during the year 

2019  capital budget 

we have currently budgeted a 2019  total capital spend of 27 billion  to 30 billion  consisting of 23 billion  to 255 billion  for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity 4000 million  to 4500 million  for midstream and infrastructure investments excluding equity investments in longhaul pipelines or the cost of any leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions we expect to drill and complete 290  to 320  gross horizontal wells in 2019  

operating results overview 

the following table summarizes our average daily production for the periods presented 



our average daily production for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017   increased  by 51215  boed or 65  

during the year ended december 31 2018  we drilled 189  gross  168  net horizontal wells and completed 176  gross  155  net operated horizontal wells 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative 

transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold production mix or commodity prices 

the following table presents the sources of our revenues for the years presented 



  

since our production consists primarily of oil our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2018  wti posted prices ranged from 4448  to 7741  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 249  to 624  per mmbtu on december 28 2018 the wti posted price for crude oil was 4515  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 325  per mmbtu lower prices may not only decrease our revenues but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative expenses  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

midstream services expense  these are costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income expense  we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions this amount reflects interest paid to our lender plus the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees net of interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of the change in the fair value of open nonhedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

deferred tax assets liabilities we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated our results of operations for 2018 include those of energen and its subsidiaries acquired by us in the merger for the period november 29 2018 the closing date of the merger through december 31 2018

production and ad valorem taxes  production and ad valorem taxes were 1327 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase  of 592 million  or 80  from 735 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices among other factors whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during the year ended december 31 2018  production and ad valorem taxes per boe increased  by 025  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to increased commodity prices and production volumes 

midstream services expense  midstream services expense was 719 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase  of 615 million  as compared to 104 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase  was primarily due to additional build out of systems and increased throughput related to increased production midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization expense increased   2963 million  or 91  from 3268 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  to 6230 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  

the following table provides components of our depreciation depletion and amortization expense for the periods presented 



the increase  in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 2729 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  resulted primarily from higher production levels and an increase in net book value on new reserves added 

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased   159 million  from 487 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  to 646 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase  was primarily due to an increase in employee count including as a result of our recent merger with energen

impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of 2455 million as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices which resulted in a reduction of the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves we did not record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31 2017 

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased 61 million from 426 million for the year ended december 31 2016 to 487 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 was 406 million as compared to 407 million for the year ended december 31 2016 a decrease of 01 million this decrease was due primarily to the issuance in october 2016 of new senior notes due 2024 with a lower interest rate than the senior notes which we redeemed in the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by the interest on the additional senior notes due in 2025 that we issued in december 2016 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of 67 million and 12 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we had a negative change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of 842 million and 265 million respectively 

provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of 196 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to an income tax provision of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2016 our effective tax rate was 39 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 01 for the year ended december 31 2016 the change in our income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 is primarily due to the reduction in our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as well as the favorable impact of the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate enacted in december 2017 while we generated positive pretax income from continuing operations in 2017 our 2017 effective tax rate was negative due to the income tax benefit generated by these items 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 16 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 8886 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase  in operating cash flows is primarily the result of an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to an increase in average prices and production growth during the year ended december 31 2018  

net cash provided by operating activities was 8886 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 3321 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to an increase in average prices and production growth during the year ended december 31 2017 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “–sources of our revenue” and item 1a “risk factors” above 

investing activities 

the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities we used cash for investing activities of 35 billion  31 billion  and 13 billion  during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2019  capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of 27 billion  to 30 billion  representing an increase  of 85  over our 2018  capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2018  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were 15 billion  we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted during the year ended december 31 2018  we spent approximately 14 billion  in cash on acquisitions of leasehold interests and mineral acres 

the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners we are currently operating 21 horizontal rigs and eight completion crews and currently intend to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs in 2019 across our asset base in the midland and delaware basins we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions 

based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2019  we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2019  however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2019  capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves if there is a decline in commodity prices our revenues cash flows results of operations liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2018  





 

critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 2 —summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities equitybased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

revenue from contracts with customers 

sales of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids are recognized at the point control of the product is transferred to the customer virtually all of the pricing provisions in our contracts are tied to a market index with certain adjustments based on among other factors whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line the quality of the oil or natural gas and the prevailing supply and demand conditions as a result the price of the oil natural gas and natural gas liquids fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil natural gas and natural gas liquids supplies 

oil sales 

our oil sales contracts are generally structured where it delivers oil to the purchaser at a contractually agreedupon delivery point at which the purchaser takes custody title and risk of loss of the product under this arrangement we or a third party transports the product to the delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser with no deduction in this scenario we recognize revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the price received from the purchaser oil revenues are recorded net of any thirdparty transportation fees and other applicable differentials in our consolidated statements of operations 

natural gas and natural gas liquids sales 

under our natural gas processing contracts it delivers natural gas to a midstream processing entity at the wellhead battery facilities or the inlet of the midstream processing entity’s system the midstream processing entity gathers and processes the natural gas and remits proceeds to us for the resulting sales of natural gas liquids and residue gas in these scenarios we evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent in the transaction for those contracts where we have concluded it is the principal and the ultimate third party is its customer we recognize revenue on a gross basis with transportation gathering processing treating and compression fees presented as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

in certain natural gas processing agreements we may elect to take its residue gas andor natural gas liquids inkind at the tailgate of the midstream entity’s processing plant and subsequently market the product through the marketing process we deliver product to the ultimate thirdparty purchaser at a contractually agreedupon delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser in this scenario we recognize revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the index price received from the purchaser the gathering processing treating and compression fees attributable to the gas processing contract as well as any transportation fees incurred to deliver the product to the purchaser are presented as transportation gathering processing treating and compression expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

midstream revenue 

substantially all revenues from gathering compression water handling disposal and treatment operations are derived from intersegment transactions for services rattler midstream operating llc or rattler provides to exploration and production operations the portion of such fees shown in our consolidated financial statements represent amounts charged to interest owners in our operated wells as well as fees charged to other third parties for water handling and treatment services provided by rattler or usage of rattler’s gathering and compression systems for gathering and compression revenue rattler satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue when low pressure volumes are delivered to a specified delivery point revenue is recognized based on the per mmbtu gathering fee or a per barrel gathering fee charged by rattler in accordance with the gathering and compression agreement for water handling and treatment revenue rattler satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the fresh water volumes have been delivered to the fracwater meter for a specified well pad and the wastewater volumes have been metered downstream of our facilities for services contracted through third party providers rattler’s performance obligation is satisfied when the service performed by the third party provider has been completed revenue is recognized based on the per barrel fresh water delivery or a wastewater gathering and disposal fee charged by rattler in accordance with the water services agreement 

transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations   

our upstream product sales contracts do not originate until production occurs and therefore are not considered to exist beyond each days’ production therefore there are no remaining performance obligation under any of our product sales contracts 

the majority of our midstream revenue agreements have a term greater than one year and as such rattler has utilized the practical expedient in asc 606 which states that we are not required to disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation under our revenue agreements each delivery generally represents a separate performance obligation therefore future volumes delivered are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required 

the remainder of our midstream revenue agreements which relate to agreements with third parties are shortterm in nature with a term of one year or less rattler has utilized an additional practical expedient in asc 606 which exempts it from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of an agreement that has an original expected duration of one year or less 

contract balances 

under our product sales contracts we have the right to invoice our customers once the performance obligations have been satisfied at which point payment is unconditional accordingly our product sales contracts do not give rise to contract assets or liabilities under accounting standards codification 606 

priorperiod performance obligations 

we record revenue in the month production is delivered to the purchaser however settlement statements for certain natural gas and natural gas liquids sales may not be received for 30 to 90 days after the date production is delivered and as a result we are required to estimate the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price that will be received for the sale of the product we record the differences between our estimates and the actual amounts received for product sales in the month that payment is received from the purchaser we have existing internal controls for our revenue estimation process and related accruals and any identified differences between our revenue estimates and actual revenue received historically have not been significant for the three months ended december 31 2018  revenue recognized in the reporting period related to performance obligations satisfied in prior reporting periods was not material we believe that the pricing provisions of our oil natural gas and natural gas liquids contracts are customary in the industry to the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas sales are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties the revenue related to expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded 

impairment 

we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under this method all acquisition exploration and development costs including certain internal costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred costs 

associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three  to five  years sales of oil and natural gas properties whether or not being amortized currently are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas 

under this method of accounting we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter the test determines a limit or ceiling on the book value of the proved oil and natural gas properties net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum from proved reserves based on the trailing 12month unweighted average of the firstdayofthemonth price adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet b the cost of properties not being amortized if any and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties if the net book value including related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling an impairment or noncash writedown is required 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 

accounting for equitybased compensation 

we grant various types of equitybased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 11 –equitybased compensation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form 10k stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the 

period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

investments 

viper has an equity interest in a limited partnership that is so minor that viper has no influence over the limited partnership’s operating and financial policies this interest was acquired during the year ended december 31 2014 and was accounted for under the cost method effective january 1 2018 viper adopted accounting standards update 201601 which requires viper to measure this investment at fair value which resulted in a downward adjustment of 187 million  to record the impact of this adoption for the year ended   december 31 2018  viper recorded a loss of 06 million  viper’s investment balance as of december 31 2018  was 145 million  which is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

funds held in escrow

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018  please read note 17 —commitments and contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives including basis swaps and threeway collars to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on nymex wti 

cushing and magellan east houston and crude oil  brent and with natural gas derivative settlements based on nymex henry hub and waha hub 

  

at december 31 2018  we had a net asset derivative position of 2153 million  as compared to a net liability derivative position of 1061 million  at december 31 2017 related to our price swap price basis swap derivatives and threeway collars utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps and fixed price basis swaps as of december 31 2018  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position to 1578 million  an increase of 576 million  while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position to 2729 million  a decrease of 576 million  however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 955 million  at december 31 2018  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 2965 million  at december 31 2018  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2018  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   26  koch supply  trading lp  15  and occidental energy marketing inc  11  for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc   11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2018  we had four  customers that represented approximately 82  of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2017  we had three  customer that represented approximately 74  of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 025  to 125  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 125  to 225  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base 

as of december 31 2018  we had 15 billion  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 410  on december 31 2018  an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our interest expense of approximately 149 million  based on the 15 billion  outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility as of such date

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174  net acres in the permian basin at december 31 2017  our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 246012  gross  206660  net acres in addition we through our subsidiary viper energy partners lp or viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 247602  gross acres 43843  net acres and 9570  net royalty acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 36  of these net royalty acres are operated by us we own viper energy partners gp llc the general partner of viper which we refer to as the general partner and we own approximately 64  of the limited partner interest in viper 

our activities are primarily focused on horizontal development of the spraberry and wolfcamp formations of the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations of the delaware basin both of which are part of the larger permian basin in west texas and new mexico the permian basin is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates 

as of december 31 2017  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 335352  mboe which includes estimated reserves of 38246  mboe attributable to the mineral interests owned by viper based on reserve reports prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 622  are classified as proved developed producing proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 168  gross  142  net horizontal well locations in which we have a working interest and nine  horizontal wells in which we own only a mineral interest through our subsidiary viper as of december 31 2017  our estimated proved reserves were approximately 70  oil 14  natural gas liquids and 16  natural gas 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data we currently have approximately 3800  gross  2750  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately 6000  per bbl wti we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves 

the challenging commodity price environment that we experienced in 2016 continued in 2017 commodity prices improved during 2017 but continued to be volatile nevertheless we believe we remain wellpositioned in this environment   during 2017  we again demonstrated our operational focus on achieving bestinclass execution lowcost operations and a conservative balance sheet as we continued to reduce drilling days well costs and operating expenses while maintaining what we believe to be a peer leading leverage ratio we intend to continue our operational focus in 2018  emphasizing full cycle economics and financial discipline we are operating ten rigs now and currently intend to operate between ten and twelve rigs in 2018 depending on market conditions we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and continue to accelerate our drilling program should commodity prices remain constant or further improve we have the option to release up to eight of our current ten rigs in 2018 should commodity prices deteriorate  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources”

our properties 

location and land 

our total acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 246012  gross  206660  net acres at december 31 2017  we are the operator of approximately 84  of this permian basin acreage in addition we through our subsidiary viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 247602  gross acres 43843  net acres and 9570  net royalty acres primarily in the permian basin approximately 36  of these net royalty acres are operated by us since our initial acquisition in the permian basin through december 31 2017  we drilled or participated in the drilling of 753  gross  608  net wells on our leasehold acreage in this area primarily targeting the wolfberry play the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry bone spring wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play as of december 31 2017  we held working interests in 1166  gross  937  net producing wells and royalty interests in 64  additional wells 

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid pennsylvanianpermian subsidence in response to dynamic structural influence it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us with established oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from 

the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations time equivalent in the delaware basin the “wolfbone” play describes vertically commingled production from the permian bone spring and wolfcamp formations 

the spraberrybone spring was deposited as siliciclastic turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberrybone spring and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the shales themselves and in the more conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs between the shales the wolfberry and wolfbone are unconventional “basincentered oil” resource plays in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

  

we have successfully developed several shale intervals within the clearfork spraberrybone spring and wolfcamp formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the shales exhibit low permeabilities which necessitate the need for hydraulic fracture stimulation to unlock the vast storage of hydrocarbons in these targets 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 1837  square miles of 3d data this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling program and identification of additional resource to be exploited 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2017  net production from our permian basin acreage was 28917  mboe or an average of 79224  boed of which approximately 74  was oil 14  was natural gas liquids and 12  was natural gas 

facilities 

our oil and natural gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilnatural gaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

  

recent and future activity 

during 2018  we expect to complete an estimated 170  to 190  gross  146  to 163  net horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2018  for drilling and infrastructure will be between 13 billion  and 15 billion  consisting of 1175 billion  to 1325 billion  for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity and 1250 million  to 1750 million  for infrastructure and other expenditures but excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2017  we drilled 150  gross  130  net and completed 123  gross  105  net horizontal wells including five drilled but uncompleted wells we acquired we participated in the drilling of 16  gross  two net nonoperated horizontal wells in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2017  our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells were 7193 million  in addition we spent 1240 million  for oil and gas infrastructure 174 million  for nonoperated properties and 24 billion  for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

we are operating ten rigs now and currently intend to operate between ten and twelve rigs in 2018 depending on market conditions we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and continue to accelerate our drilling program should commodity prices remain constant or further improve we have the option to release up to eight of our current ten rigs in 2018 should commodity prices deteriorate 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2017  were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 83 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 17 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our executive vice president–reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our executive vice president–reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 24  years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

 

 

  

 

 

 



the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 



 

the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“risk factors” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2017  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 91935  mbbls of oil 94629  mmcf of natural gas and 19198  mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 126905  mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2017  



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 67676  mboe from 87  gross  75  net wells in which we have a working interest and 3004  mboe from 40  gross wells in which viper owns royalty interests of the 87  gross wells 26  were in the delaware basin transfers of 31666  mboe were the result of drilling or participating in 44  gross  37  net horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 27  gross wells in which we have a royalty interest or mineral interest through viper we own a working interest in 23  of the 27  gross viper wells net purchases of 6246  mboe were primarily from our purchase in pecos and reeves counties downward revisions of 4710  mboe resulted from reclassification of seven  locations and technical revisions 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 1454 million  during 2017  estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 5954 million  in 2018  2056 million  in 2019  1712 million  in 2020  and 583 million  in 2021  since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

as of december 31 2017  all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five  years from the date they were initially recorded 

as of december 31 2017  none  of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and natural gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 



 

productive wells 

as of december 31 2017  we owned an average unweighted 80  working interest in 1166  gross  937  net productive wells and an average 27  royalty interest in 64  additional wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average unweighted 92  royalty or mineral interest in 1287  productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2017  relating to our leasehold acreage 



 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2017  that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



as of december 31 2017  we had 83  gross  66  net wells in the process of drilling completing or dewatering or shut in awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table 

title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

we have entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company in which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to shell trading us company our agreement with shell trading us company has an initial term of five years ending september 30 2018 the agreement may also be terminated by shell trading us company by written notice to us in the event that shell trading us company’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to elect to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity this decreased contract quantity if elected would be effective for 

the remainder of the term of the agreement shell trading us company has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the nymex over the onemonth period as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in the agreement if we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement during any threemonth period following the service commencement date we have agreed to pay shell trading us company a deficiency payment which is calculated by multiplying i the volume of oil that we failed to deliver as required under the agreement during such period by ii magellan’s longhorn spot tariff rate in effect for transportation from crane texas to the houston ship channel for the period of time for which such deficiency volume is calculated 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production in the midland basin is transported to purchasers by pipeline we anticipate that our production in the delaware basin transported to purchasers by pipeline will increase to 80 by the end of 2018 during 2018 several oil and saltwater disposal gathering systems were installed we believe that these gathering systems will help us reduce our lease operating expense and improve our margins on sales in future periods 

the following table presents the average percentage of produced oil sold by pipeline and the average percentage of produced water connected to saltwater disposals by pipeline 



the following table presents the average cost per bbl to transport produced oil and water by truck and by pipeline as well as the average savings of transporting produced oil and water by pipeline versus truck 



oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1250  to 2500  resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 7500  to 8750  

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our o il and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from  our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is often strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our  operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling   the resource conservation and recovery act as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” also in december 2016 the epa agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste it has until march 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses   

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released   

water discharges   the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit on june 29 2015 the epa and the us army corps of engineers or the usace jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the clean water act to the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the clean water act’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas following its promulgation numerous states and industry groups challenged the rule and on october 9 2015 a federal court stayed the rule’s implementation nationwide pending further action in court in response to this decision the epa and the usace have resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the united states” further on february 28 2017 president trump signed an executive order directing the relevant executive agencies to review the rules and to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them as appropriate under the stated policies of protecting navigable waters from pollution while promoting economic growth reducing uncertainty and showing due regard for congress and the states on july 27 2017 the epa and the usace published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 rules and on november 22 2017 the agencies published a proposed rule to maintain the status quo pending the agencies review of the 2015 rules 

the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions   

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the oil pollution act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the oil pollution act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters   

noncompliance with the clean water act or the oil pollution act may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations  we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions   the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” also on may 12 2016 the epa issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects   

climate change in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes in may 2010 the epa adopted regulations establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration or psd and title v programs of the clean air act on june 23 2014 in utility air regulatory group v epa  the supreme court held that stationary sources could not become subject to psd or title v permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions the court ruled however that the epa may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the psd and title v programs on august 26 2016 the epa proposed changes needed to bring the epa’s air permitting regulations in line with the supreme court’s decision on greenhouse gas permitting the proposed rule was published in the federal register on october 3 2016 and the public comment period closed on december 2 2016 

additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in november 2010 the epa expanded the greenhouse gas reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing transmission storage and distribution facilities which may include certain of our facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 in october 2015 the epa amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from gathering and boosting systems completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines   

in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of greenhouse gases the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly   

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and begin negotiations to either reenter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the united states the paris agreement sets forth a specific exit process whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date with such withdrawal taking effect 

one year from such notice it is not clear what steps the trump administration plans to take to withdraw from the paris agreement whether a new agreement can be negotiated or what terms would be included in such an agreement furthermore in response to the announcement many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business   

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

in addition the epa previously announced its plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by june 2018 which would describe a proposed mechanism  regulatory voluntary or a combination of both  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures also on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015  the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will 

likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration   in particular on may 12 2016 the epa amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new modified and reconstructed equipment processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector however in a march 28 2017 executive order president trump directed the epa to review the 2016 regulations and if appropriate to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production on june 16 2017 the epa published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations including fugitive emission requirements these standards as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards   andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids   the texas legislature adopted legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process   the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells   

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the 

regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases  our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production   

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas   

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices   

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas  we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill   

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas  where we operate although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements   

natural gas sales and transportation   historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price  of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales ” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties   

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that  we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities   

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services are provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our   costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations   

oil sales and transportation   sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future   

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors   

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to  us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation   texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations  we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us   

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells 

comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 251  full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland and in oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 

availability of company reports 

our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the investor relations page of our website at wwwdiamondbackenergycom as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the sec information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business and properties” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly volatility in prices for oil and natural gas have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during the past five years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of  2619 per barrel or bbl in february 2016 

to a high of 11062 per bbl in september 2013 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of   149  per mmbtu in march 2016  to a high of 815 per mmbtu in february 2014 during 2017  wti prices ranged from   4248  to 6046   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from   244  to 371   per mmbtu on   january 29 2018  the wti posted price for crude oil was   6571   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 360  per mmbtu representing increases  of 9  and 3  respectively from the high of 6046  per bbl of oil and 371  per mmbtu for natural gas during 2017  if the prices of oil and natural gas decline our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

concerns over general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european asian and the united states financial markets have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the global economy these factors combined with volatility in commodity prices business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates may precipitate an economic slowdown concerns about global economic growth may have an adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish which could impact the price at which we can sell our production affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2017  our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 32 billion  our 2018  capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 13 billion  to 15 billion  representing an increase  of 60  over our 2017  capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 



 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2018  could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

 

 

 

 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

  

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities   

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations   

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history from inception through december 31 2017  we drilled a total of 412  gross horizontal wells and 262  gross vertical wells and participated in an additional 61  gross horizontal wells and 18  gross vertical nonoperated wells of which 670  wells were completed as producing wells and 83  wells were in various stages of completion if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

at an assumed price of approximately 6000  per bbl wti we currently have approximately 3800  gross  2750  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2017  only 168  of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified approximately 873  horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business through december 31 2017  we are the operator of or have participated in a total of 466  horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

multiwell pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results 

we utilize multiwell pad drilling where practical because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location multiwell pad drilling delays the commencement of production which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2017  we had leases representing 22913  net acres expiring in 2018  19670  net acres expiring in 2019  20219  net acres expiring in 2020  719  net acres expiring in 2021  and no  net acres expiring in 2022  the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2018  we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional fixed price swap fixed price basis swap derivatives or costless collars for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2018 and 2019 production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil 

we use fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on nymex wti pricing the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty under the company’s costless collar contracts we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the call option price the counterparty is required to make a payment 

to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the put option price these contracts and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 

as of december 31 2017  we had the following commodity contracts in place covering nymex wti crude oil brent crude oil and nymex henry hub natural gas for the production period of january 2018  through december 2018  

 

 

 

 

 

we have crude oil swap contracts priced at a weighted average price of 4982  wti for 1095000  aggregate bbls with a production period of january 2019  through december 2019  to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further we will not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to an agreement with shell trading us company under which we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to shell trading us company our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity this decreased quantity if elected would be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under the oil purchase agreement which may result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 730 million  at december 31 2017  and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 1586 million  at december 31 2017  joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 

current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value   

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized  we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves  the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 1111  1123  and 1784  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 3219 million  1764 million  and 2161 million  respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense  beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

impairments on proved oil and natural gas properties of 2455 million  and 8148 million  were recorded for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the year ended december 31 2017  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations–critical accounting policies and estimates–method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves  and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves   

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves  as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  which include those attributable to viper are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates  reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities–oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future   

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe because they have become uneconomic or otherwise   

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate   

approximately   378   of our total estimated proved reserves as of   december 31 2017  were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves   

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area   

all of our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of   december 31 2017  all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play in the midland basin this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field   

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business operations have grown substantially since our initial public offering in october 2012 and we expect our business operations to continue to grow in the future as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas   

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations  and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

  

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations imposed strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us even if federal regulatory burdens temporarily ease the historic trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations may continue in the longterm and at the state and local levels see item 1 “business–regulation” for a description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act   

in addition the epa previously announced its plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by june 2018 which would describe a proposed mechanism  regulatory voluntary or a combination of both  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures also on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rules seek to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015   the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration    

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office 

have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids    for a more detailed discussion of state and local laws and initiatives concerning hydraulic fracturing see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–regulation of hydraulic fracturing”  we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing   

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our 

operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the commodities futures trading commission’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the commodities futures trading commission to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the commodities futures trading commission has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the commodities futures trading commission will finalize certain other related rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

recently enacted us tax legislation as well as future us tax legislations may adversely affect our   business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

  

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law public law no 11597 a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs ac which we refer to as the tax act that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code among other changes the tax act i reduces the maximum us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 ii preserves longstanding upstream oil and gas tax provisions such as immediate deduction of intangible drilling iii allows for immediate expensing of capital expenditures for tangible personal property for a period of time iv modifies the provisions related to the limitations on deductions for executive compensation of publicly traded corporations and v enacts new limitations regarding the deductibility of interest expense the tax act is complex and farreaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional 

regulatory guidance that may be issued and any such changes in our interpretations and assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

in addition from time to time legislation has been proposed that if enacted into law would make significant changes to us federal and state income tax laws affecting the oil and gas industry including i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and iii an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures while these specific changes are not included in the tax act no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or if enacted what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that would impose additional tax on our activities or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration development or similar activities could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs while we are subject to certain federal greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives for a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–environmental regulationclimate change”   

at the international level in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and begin negotiations to either reenter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the united states the paris agreement sets forth a specific exit process whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice it is not clear what steps the trump administration plans to take to withdraw from the paris agreement whether a new agreement can be negotiated or what terms would be included in such an agreement furthermore in response to the announcement many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for price of and value of our products and reserves as our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business   

in addition there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital furthermore claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury property damages or other liabilities while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully 

insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity in addition a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states most recently in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal in response to these concerns regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells for example on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water or other oil and gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well if the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity then the agency may deny modify suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well the commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells 

we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities while these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations these legal requirements are subject to change which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements owing to among other things concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore are exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the natural gas act of 1938 however the distinction between ferc–regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices 

for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed   

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to 

discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties   

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations   

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical   

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry   

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies  as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations   could be materially and adversely affected   

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business   

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations  we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results   

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2017  2016  and 2015  and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we incurred 342 million  335 million  and 246 million  respectively of stock based compensation expense of which we capitalized 86 million  71 million  and 60 million  respectively pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely 

affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business   

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and   our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all   

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss   

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of its vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of its business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business   

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness 

as of december 31 2017  we had total longterm debt of 15 billion  including 10 billion  outstanding under the 2024 senior notes and 2025 senior notes and we had an unused borrowing base availability of 6030 million  under our revolving credit facility on january 29 2018 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of new 5375 senior notes due 2025 which we refer to as the new 2025 notes as additional notes under our existing indenture and repaid 3085 million  of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds from the issuance of our new 2025 notes immediately following the issuance of the new 2025 notes and the application of our net proceeds thereof we had total longterm debt of 139 billion including 13 billion attributable to all of our outstanding senior notes our borrowing base remained 18 billion as the lenders waived the borrowing base decrease under our revolving credit facility in connection with the issuance of the new 2025 notes our elected commitment was 10 billion and we had 9114 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  viper one of our subsidiaries had 935 million  in outstanding borrowings and 3065 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility the indentures governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering on june 23 2014 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which modified certain provisions of our revolving credit facility to allow us among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under the amended revolving credit facility we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the amended revolving credit facility including the related guaranty and all liens on the assets of and the equity interests in viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary under the amended revolving credit facility were automatically released further viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiaries viper energy partners llc and rattler midstream llc formerly known as white fang energy llc are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 

we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility if default occurs the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 

availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of 18 billion  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 10 billion  the borrowing base is subject to scheduled annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors as of december 31 2017  we had 3970 million  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 297  on december 31 2017  on january 29 2018 we repaid 3085 million  of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility with the net proceeds from the issuance of our new 2025 notes immediately following the issuance of the new 2025 notes and the application of our net proceeds thereof our borrowing base remained 18 billion as the lenders waived the borrowing base decrease under our revolving credit facility in connection with the issuance of the new 2025 notes our elected commitment was 10 billion and we had 9114 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow further if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination we would be required to repay the excess we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing we may have to sell significant assets any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including our senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more 

alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2017  our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at 18 billion  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 10 billion  and we had 3970 million  outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2017  viper had 935 million  in outstanding borrowings and 3065 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility further the indentures governing the senior notes allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors the indentures governing the senior notes also allow us to incur certain other additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our and viper’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 025  to 125  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 125  to 225  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2017  we had 3970 million  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 297  on december 31 2017  viper’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 319  during the year ended december 31 2017  as of december 31 2017  viper had 935 million  in outstanding borrowings and 3065 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 

 

 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

in the past we have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies and may do so again in the future these transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur 

without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such future sales may occur may cause our stock price to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock except for any shares purchased by our affiliates all of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent equity offerings are freely tradable in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the market perceives that such sales may occur the price of our stock could decline 

the declaration of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders 

on february 13 2018 we announced that we are initiating an annual cash dividend in the amount of 050 per share of our common stock payable quarterly beginning with the first quarter of 2018 the decision to pay this first dividend or any future dividends however is solely within the discretion of and subject to approval by our board of directors our board of directors’ determination with respect to any such dividends including the record date the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend will depend upon our profitability and financial condition contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination based on its evaluation of these factors the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 

as of december 31 2017  we had a net operating loss or nol carry forward of approximately 3570 million  for federal income tax purposes if we were to experience an “ownership change” as determined under section 382 of the code our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with nols generated prior to the ownership change would be limited possibly substantially in general an ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our prechange nols we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the longterm taxexempt rate in general an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more “5 shareholders” as defined in the internal revenue code at any time during a rolling threeyear period 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the wolfcamp and spraberry formations in the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in the delaware basin we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multiyear inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production 

the following table sets forth our production data for the periods indicated 



on december 31 2017  our acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 246012  gross  206660  net acres which consisted of approximately 117586  gross  101941  net acres in the northern midland basin and approximately 128426  gross  104719  net acres in the southern delaware basin 

2017  transactions and recent developments 

our delaware basin acquisition 

on february 28 2017 we completed an acquisition of oil and natural gas properties midstream assets and other related assets in the delaware basin for an aggregate purchase price consisting of 174 billion  in cash and 769 million  shares of our common stock of which approximately 115 million  shares were placed in an indemnity escrow this transaction included the acquisition of i approximately 100306  gross  80339  net acres primarily in pecos and reeves counties for approximately 25 billion  and ii midstream assets for approximately 476 million  we used the net proceeds from our december 2016 equity offering net proceeds from our december 2016 debt offering cash on hand and other financing sources to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for this acquisition 

new senior notes 

on january 29 2018 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of new 2025 notes as additional notes under our existing indenture dated as of december 20 2016 as supplemented among us subsidiary guarantors party thereto and wells fargo as trustee under which we previously issued 5000 million aggregate principal amount of our existing 5375 senior notes due 2025 we received approximately 3084 million in net proceeds after deducting the initial purchaser’s discount and our estimated offering expenses but disregarding accrued interest from the issuance of the new 2025 notes we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the new 2025 notes to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

viper equity offerings 

in january 2017 viper completed an underwritten public offering of 9775000  common units which included 1275000  common units issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional common units granted to the underwriters viper received net proceeds from this offering of approximately 1475 million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of which viper used 1205 million  to repay the outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit agreement and the balance was used for general partnership purposes which included additional acquisitions 

in july 2017 viper completed an underwritten public offering of 16100000  common units which included 2100000  common units issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional common units granted to the underwriters in this offering we purchased 700000  common units an affiliate of the general partner purchased 3000000  common units and certain officers and directors of our company and the general partner purchased an aggregate of 114000  common units in each case directly from the underwriters following this offering we had an approximate 64  limited partner interest in viper viper received net proceeds from this offering of approximately 2325 million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of which viper used 1528 million  to repay all of the thenoutstanding borrowings under viper’s revolving credit facility and the balance was used to fund a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions and for general partnership purposes 

operational update 

we are operating ten rigs now and currently intend to operate between ten and twelve drilling rigs in 2018 across our asset base in the midland and delaware basins we plan to operate six to seven of these rigs in the midland basin targeting horizontal development of the wolfcamp and spraberry formations with four to five rigs are expected to operate in the delaware basin targeting the wolfcamp and bone spring formations 

in the midland basin we continue have positive results across our core development areas located within midland martin howard glasscock and andrews counties where development has primarily focused on drilling longlateral multiwell pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations we are currently operating six rigs on the acreage and expect to average approximately six to eight operated rigs in 2018 

in the delaware basin we have now drilled and completed multiple wells in pecos reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a which we believe has been derisked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target additionally we have successfully completed additional wells targeting such zones as the wolfcamp b and 2nd bone spring and expect to test these zones further in 2018 we are currently operating four rigs in the delaware basin and plan to average approximately four to five rigs in 2018 

we continue to focus on low cost operations and best in class execution in doing so we are focused on controlling oilfield service costs as our service providers seek to increase pricing following continued strength in the oil market to combat rising service costs we have looked to lock in pricing for dedicated activity levels and will continue to seek opportunities to control additional well cost where possible our 2018 drilling and completion budget accounts for rising capital costs that we believe will cover potential increases in our service costs during the year 

2018  capital budget 

we have currently budgeted a 2018  total capital spend of 13 billion  to 15 billion  consisting of 1175 billion  to 1325 billion  for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity and 1250 million  to 1750 million  for infrastructure and other expenditures but excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions we expect to drill and complete 170  to 190  gross horizontal wells in 2018  

operating results overview 

the following table summarizes our average daily production for the periods presented 



our average daily production for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016   increased  by 36193  boed or 84  

during the year ended december 31 2017  we drilled 150  gross  130  net horizontal wells and participated in the drilling of 16  gross  two net nonoperated horizontal wells in the permian basin 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold production mix or commodity prices 

the following table presents the sources of our revenues for the years presented 



  

since our production consists primarily of oil our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2017  wti posted prices ranged from 4248  to 6046  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 244  to 371  per mmbtu on december 29 2017  the wti posted price for crude oil was 6046  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 369  per mmbtu lower prices may not only decrease our revenues but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative expenses  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

midstream services expense  these are costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income expense  we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions this amount reflects interest paid to our lender plus the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees net of interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of the change in the fair value of open nonhedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

deferred tax assets liabilities we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 





 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016   

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased  by approximately 6592 million  or 125  to 12 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 5271 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased  by 36193  boed to 79224  boed during the year ended december 31 2017  from 43031  boed during the year ended december 31 2016  the total increase  in revenue of approximately 6592 million  is attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes and higher average sales prices for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increases  in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our production increased  by 9856  mbbls of oil 1656  mbbls of natural gas liquids and 9931  mmcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  

the net dollar effect of the increases in prices of approximately 2137 million  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 4454 million  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 



 

lease bonus revenue  lease bonus revenue was 118 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  28 million of which was attributable to lease bonus payments to extend the term of seven leases reflecting an average bonus of 3442 per acre and the remaining 91 million was attributable to lease bonus payments on three new leases reflecting an average bonus of 14320 per acre we had no lease bonus revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  

midstream services revenue  midstream services revenue was 71 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  we had no midstream services revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  our midstream services revenue represents fees charged to our joint interest owners and third parties for the transportation of oil and natural gas along with water gathering and related disposal facilities these assets complement our operations in areas where we have significant production 

lease operating expenses  lease operating expenses were 1265 million   438  per boe for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase  of 441 million  from 824 million   523  per boe for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in lease operating expense was due to an increase of 234 producing wells compared to 2016 this increase was offset by higher production volumes which resulted in a decrease in lease operating expense per boe 

production and ad valorem taxes  production and ad valorem taxes increased  to 735 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 345 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  in general production taxes and ad valorem 

taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices the increase in production and ad valorem taxes during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in our production taxes as a result of increased commodity prices and volumes 

midstream services expense  midstream services expense was 104 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  we had no midstream services expense for the year ended december 31 2016  midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems natural gas lift compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities

the increase  in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 1455 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  resulted primarily from higher production levels and an increase in net book value on new reserves added 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of 2455 million  as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices which resulted in a reduction of the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves we did no t record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31 2017  

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased   61 million  from 426 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  to 487 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase  was due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017  was 406 million  as compared to 407 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  a decrease  of 01 million  this decrease  was due primarily to the issuance in october 2016 of new senior notes due 2024 with a lower interest rate than the senior notes which we redeemed in the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by the interest on the additional senior notes due in 2025 that we issued in december 2016 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of 67 million  and 12 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016  we had a negative change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of 842 million  and 265 million  respectively

reduction in the federal statutory tax rate enacted in december 2017 while we generated positive pretax income from continuing operations in 2017 our 2017 effective tax rate was negative due to the income tax benefit generated by these items 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015   

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 804 million or 18 to 5271 million for the year ended december 31 2016 from 4467 million for the year ended december 31 2015 our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 9933 boed to 43031 boed during the year ended december 31 2016 from 33098 boed during the year ended december 31 2015 the total increase in revenue of approximately 804 million is largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes partially offset by lower average sales prices for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our production increased by 2481 mbbls of oil 722 mbbls of natural gas liquids and 2797 mmcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 

the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 466 million calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 1269 million calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 



 

lease operating expenses  lease operating expenses were 824 million 523 per boe for the year ended december 31 2016 a decrease of 02 million from 826 million 684 per boe for the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease is a result of efficiencies we achieved in our field operations upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells

the decreases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 397 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 resulted primarily from the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded in 2016 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we recorded impairments of oil and gas properties of 2455 million and 8148 million respectively as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices which resulted in a reduction of the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased 107 million from 320 million for the year ended december 31 2015 to 426 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was due to increases in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce and equitybased compensation

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8886 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 3321 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase  in operating cash flows is primarily the result of an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to an increase in average prices and production growth during the year ended december 31 2017  

net cash provided by operating activities was 3321 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 4165 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease in operating cash flows is primarily the result of a higher gain on settlement of derivative instruments during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “–sources of our revenue” and item 1a “risk factors” above

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2018  capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of 13 billion  to 15 billion  representing an increase  of 60  over our 2017  capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2017  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were 8607 million  we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately 

forecasted during the year ended december 31 2017  we spent approximately 20 billion  on acquisitions of leasehold interests primarily related to the brigham resources acquisition which closed on february 28 2017 

the amount and timing of these capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners with recent improvement in oil prices we are currently operating ten horizontal rigs and four completion crews we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions 

based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2018  we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2018  however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2018  capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves further if the decline in commodity prices continue our revenues cash flows results of operations liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities equitybased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser net of royalty interests discounts and allowances as applicable we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves no receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided 

impairment 

we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under this method all acquisition exploration and development costs including certain internal costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three  to five  years sales of oil and natural gas properties whether or not being amortized currently are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas 

under this method of accounting we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter the test determines a limit or ceiling on the book value of the proved oil and natural gas properties net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum from proved reserves based on the trailing 12month unweighted average of the firstdayofthemonth price adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet b the cost of properties not being amortized if any and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties if the net book value including related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling an impairment or noncash writedown is required 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is 

depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 

accounting for equitybased compensation 

we grant various types of equitybased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 10 –equitybased compensation stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently issued pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” this update supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in gaap and requires i an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services and ii requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers 

we will adopt this accounting standards update effective january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach we have reviewed various contracts that represent our material revenue streams and determined that there will be no impact to our financial position results of operations or liquidity upon adoption of this accounting standards update we will not be required to record a cumulative effect adjustment due to the new accounting standards update not having a quantitative impact compared to existing gaap also upon adoption of this accounting standards update we will not be required to alter our existing information technology and internal controls outside of ongoing contract review processes in order to identify impacts of future revenue contracts entered into by us we do not anticipate the disclosure requirements under the accounting standards update to have a material change on how we present information regarding our revenue streams as compared to existing gaap 

in january 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201601 “financial instruments–overall” this update applies to any entity that holds financial assets or owes financial liabilities this update 

requires equity investments except for those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income viper will adopt this standard effective january 1 2018 by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment which will decrease viper’s unitholders’ equity and will bring the fair value of its investment to 152 million  or 1520  per unit for that investment 

in august 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201615 “statement of cash flows  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” this update apples to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows this update provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs settlement of zerocoupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing contingent consideration payments made after a business combination proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies including bankowned life insurance policies distributions received from equity method investees beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle we will adopt this update effective january 1 2018 using the retrospective transition method adoption of this standard will change the presentation of our cash flows and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201618 “statement of cash flows  restricted cash” this update affects entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents we adopted this update retrospectively effective january 1 2018 adoption of this standard will change the presentation of our cash flows and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201701 “business combinations  clarifying the definition of a business” this update apples to all entities that must determine whether they acquired or sold a business this update provides a screen to determine when a set is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business we will adopt this update prospectively effective january 1 2018 the adoption of this update will not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201602 “leases” this update applies to any entity that enters into a lease with some specified scope exemptions under this update a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term while there were no major changes to the lessor accounting changes were made to align key aspects with the revenue recognition guidance this update will be effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted entities will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach we believe the primary impact of adopting this standard will be the recognition of assets and liabilities on our balance sheet for current operating leases we are still evaluating the impact of this standard 

in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201613 “financial instruments  credit losses” this update affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income the amendments affect loans debt securities trade receivables net investments in leases offbalance sheet credit exposures reinsurance receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash this update will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years this update will be applied through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements since we do not have a history of credit losses 

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017  please read note 15  included in notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives including basis swaps and costless collars to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on nymex wti and crude oil brent and with natural gas derivative settlements based on nymex henry hub 

  

at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had a net liability derivative position of 1067 million  and 226 million  respectively related to our price swap and price basis swap derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps and fixed price basis swaps as of december 31 2017  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net liability position to 1802 million  an increase of 741 million  while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net liability derivative position to 321 million  a decrease of 741 million  however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 730 million  at december 31 2017  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 1586 million  at december 31 2017  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2017  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   31  koch supply  trading lp  19  and enterprise crude oil llc  11  for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc   13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2017  we had three  customers that represented approximately 74  of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2016  we had three  customer that represented approximately 75  of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 025  to 125  in the case of the 

alternative base rate and from 125  to 225  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base 

as of december 31 2017  we had 3970 million  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 297  on december 31 2017  an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our interest expense of approximately 40 million  based on the 3970 million  outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility as of such date

 item 1 business and properties 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174  net acres in the permian basin at december 31 2016  our total net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 105894  net acres in addition we through our subsidiary viper energy partners lp or viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 107568  gross  6404  net royalty acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 41  of these net acres are operated by us we own viper energy partners gp llc the general partner of viper which we refer to as the general partner and we own approximately 74  of the limited partner interest in viper 

our activities are primarily focused on horizontal development of the spraberry and wolfcamp formations of the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations of the delaware basin both of which are part of the larger permian basin in west texas and new mexico the permian basin is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates 

as of december 31 2016  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 205457  mboe which includes estimated reserves of 31435  mboe attributable to the mineral interests owned by viper based on reserve reports prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 579  are classified as proved developed producing proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 120  gross  102  net horizontal well locations in which we have a working interest and 14  horizontal wells in which we own only a mineral interest through our subsidiary viper as of december 31 2016  our estimated proved reserves were approximately 68  oil 18  natural gas liquids and 14  natural gas 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data we currently have approximately 2722  gross  1802  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately 5000  per bbl wti we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves 

the challenging commodity price environment that we experienced in 2015 continued in 2016 with the posted price of wti reaching a 12year low of 2619  per barrel on february 11 2016 commodity prices improved during 2016 but continued to be volatile nevertheless we believe we remain wellpositioned in this environment during 2016  we again demonstrated our operational focus on achieving bestinclass execution lowcost operations and a conservative balance sheet as we continued to reduce drilling days well costs and operating expenses while maintaining what we believe to be a peer leading leverage ratio we intend to continue our operational focus in 2017  emphasizing full cycle economics and financial discipline we are operating six rigs now and currently intend to operate between six and ten rigs in 2017 depending on market conditions we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and continue to accelerate our drilling program should commodity prices remain constant or further improve we have the option to release up to three of our current six rigs in 2017 should commodity prices deteriorate  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

our pending acquisition 

on december 13 2016 we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with brigham resources operating llc and brigham resources midstream llc or together brigham to acquire certain assets of brigham for aggregate consideration consisting of 162 billion  in cash and the issuance of 769 million  shares of our common stock to brigham subject to certain adjustments we refer to this transaction as the pending acquisition the assets located in pecos and reeves counties 

in texas include over 93761  gross  76319  net acres approximately 9500  boed  77  oil of average net production for november 2016 based on production completion and flowback data provided by brigham that has not been verified by us from 48  gross producing horizontal wells and 16  gross producing vertical wells the assets are also estimated to include six  drilled but uncompleted wells as of january 1 2017 based on our internal estimates and the data provided by brigham we believe the assets include approximately 1149  net royalty acres additionally based on publicly available data with respect to recent horizontal wells on and surrounding the properties we believe the assets are prospective for four primary targets wolfcamp a wolfcamp b the 3rd bone spring and the 2nd bone spring we believe that development potential within the footprint of the pending acquisition includes 1213  net identified economic potential horizontal locations based on 880 foot spacing  six  wells per section in the wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b and 1320 foot interlateral spacing  four  wells per section in the 3rd bone spring and 2nd bone spring additional development and downspacing potential may exist throughout the wolfcamp and bone spring intervals we believe that the identified potential horizontal locations are conducive to more capital efficient longer laterals with an average of approximately 8500  feet assuming all of the acreage in the pending acquisition is acquired our total leasehold interest as of december 31 2016 would have been approximately 182000  net acres the foregoing data and estimates are based primarily on information provided to us by brigham we have not yet verified these results and estimates and cannot assure you that actual results will not differ see item 1a “risk factorsrisks related to the pending acquisition” for a discussion of these risks

generally in contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities we are the operator of approximately 98  of our acreage this operational control allows us to manage more efficiently the pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical applications including horizontal development our average 79  working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies 

 

 

our strengths 

we believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals 

 



well spacing may vary from these distances due to different factors which would result in a higher or lower location count the twostream gross estimated ultimate recoveries or eurs from our future pud horizontal wells as estimated by ryder scott as of december 31 2016  range from 494  mboe per well consisting of 366  mbbls of oil and 769  mmcf of natural gas to 1273  mboe per well consisting of 995  mbbls of oil and 1667  mmcf of natural gas for wells ranging in lateral length from approximately 7500  feet to approximately 10000  feet in intervals including the clearfork middle spraberry lower spraberry wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b ryder scott has estimated gross eurs of 620  mboe for our wolfcamp b wells in midland county and 998  mboe for our lower spraberry wells in midland county which constitute 47  of our remaining pud horizontal wells in each case based on 7500  foot lateral lengths in addition we have approximately 871  square miles of proprietary 3d seismic data covering our acreage this data facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity including additional horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions 

 

 

 

our properties 

location and land 

our total net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 105894  net acres at december 31 2016  we are the operator of approximately 98  of this permian basin acreage in addition we through our subsidiary viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 107568  gross  6404  net royalty acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 41  of these net acres are operated by us since our initial acquisition in the permian basin through december 31 2016  we drilled or participated in the drilling of 585  gross  474  net wells on our leasehold acreage in this area primarily targeting the wolfberry play the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play as of december 31 2016  we held working interests in 998  gross  792  net producing wells 

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid mississippianpennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the ouachita fold belt it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations we refer to the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp strawn and atoka formations collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play of the midland basin lies in the area where the historically productive spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of the emerging wolfcamp play time equivalent in the delaware basin the “wolfbone” play describes vertically commingled production from the permian bone spring and wolfcamp formations 

the spraberrybone spring was deposited as turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberrybone spring and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the shales themselves and in the more conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs between the shales the wolfberry and wolfbone are unconventional “basincentered oil” resource plays in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

  

we have successfully developed several shale intervals within the clearfork spraberry and wolfcamp formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the shales exhibit microdarcy permeabilities which result in relatively small drainage areas and recovery factors so relatively small interwell spacing is necessary 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 871  square miles of 3d data this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling activities and to identify and avoid potential geohazards eg faults and lithologies that are difficult to drill 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2016  net production from our permian basin acreage was 15749436  boe or an average of 43031  boed of which approximately 73  was oil 16  was natural gas liquids and 11  was natural gas 

facilities 

our oil and natural gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilnatural gaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

  

future activity 

during 2017  we expect to drill an estimated 130  to 165  gross  110  to 140  net horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures in 2017  for drilling and infrastructure will be between 8000 million  and 10 billion  consisting of 6500 million  to 8250 million  for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity and 1500 million  to 1750 million  for infrastructure and other expenditures but excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2016  we drilled 73  gross  61  net and completed 62  gross  54  net horizontal wells we drilled and completed two  gross  one net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of 19  gross 

 five net nonoperated horizontal wells in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2016  our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells were 3100 million  we spent 280 million  for oil and gas infrastructure and 250 million  for nonoperated properties we spent an additional 8170 million  for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

we are operating six rigs now and currently intend to operate between six and ten rigs in 2017 depending on market conditions we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and continue to accelerate our drilling program should commodity prices remain constant or further improve we have the option to release up to three of our current six rigs in 2017 should commodity prices deteriorate 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2016  were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 90 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 10 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our vice president–reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our vice president–reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience 

staff has an average of approximately 24  years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 



 

the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result 

the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“risk factors” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2016  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 59717  mbbls of oil 69497  mmcf of natural gas and 15054  mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 86354  mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2016  



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 40180  mboe from 51  gross  48  net wells in which we have a working interest in addition viper owns the mineral interests associated with 30  of the 51  gross wells of the 51  gross wells 22  were in howard and glasscock counties where our initial horizontal development began in 2016 transfers of 13383  mboe of undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves were the result of drilling or participating in 21  gross  16  net horizontal wells and three  gross  two  net vertical wells through viper we have a mineral ownership in 16  of the gross wells downward revisions of 5210 mboe are primarily the result of downgrading 17  horizontal locations due to lower commodity prices of the 17  locations 13  were in the wolfcamp b zone and four  were in the clearfork zone with an increase in commodity prices these locations may be developed at some future time   

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 476 million  during 2016  estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 2019 million  in 2017  1681 million  in 2018  1424 million  in 2019  and 53 million  in 2020  since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

as of december 31 2016  all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five  years from the date they were initially recorded 

as of december 31 2016  less than 10  of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and natural gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 



 

productive wells 

as of december 31 2016  we owned an average unweighted 79  working interest in 998  gross  792  net productive wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average unweighted 13  royalty or mineral interest in 735  productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2016  relating to our leasehold acreage 



 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2016  that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



as of december 31 2016  we had 52  gross  36  net wells in the process of drilling completing or dewatering or shut in awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table 

title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc  13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 

we have entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company in which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to shell trading us company our agreement with shell trading us company has an initial term of five years ending september 30 2018 the agreement may also be terminated by shell trading us company by written notice to us in the event that shell trading us company’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to elect to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity this decreased contract quantity if elected would be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement shell trading us company has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the nymex over the onemonth period as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in the agreement if we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement during any threemonth period following the service commencement date we have agreed to pay shell trading us company a deficiency payment which is calculated by multiplying i the volume of oil that we failed to deliver as required under the agreement during such period by ii magellan’s longhorn spot tariff rate in effect for transportation from crane texas to the houston ship channel for the period of time for which such deficiency volume is calculated 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production is transported to the purchaser by pipeline which we anticipate will increase to approximately 85 for oil by the end of 2017 

during 2016 several oil and saltwater disposal gathering systems were installed at december 31 2016  approximately 87  of our produced water was connected to saltwater disposals by pipe and approximately 80  of our oil production was sold by pipe these initiatives reduced the cost of the water which was being trucked to disposal by approximately 092 bbl and reduced the transportation cost of the oil being sold by truck by 050 bbl to 100 bbl we believe that these gathering systems will help us reduce our lease operating expense and improve our margins on sales in future periods 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 2000  to 2500  resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 7500  to 8000  

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our o il and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from  our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is often strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our  operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling   the resource conservation and recovery act as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing 

requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” also in december 2016 the epa agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste it has until march 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses   

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released   

water discharges   the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions   

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the oil pollution act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the oil pollution act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters   

noncompliance with the clean water act or the oil pollution act may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations  we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions   the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” also on may 12 2016 the epa issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects   

climate change in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes in may 2010 the epa adopted regulations establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration or psd and title v programs of the clean air act on june 23 2014 in utility air regulatory group v epa  the supreme court held that stationary sources could not become subject to psd or title v permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions the court ruled however that the epa may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the psd and title v programs on august 26 2016 the epa proposed changes needed to bring the epa’s air permitting regulations in line with the supreme court’s decision on greenhouse gas permitting the proposed rule was published in the federal register on october 3 2016 and the public comment period closed on december 2 2016 

additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in november 2010 the epa expanded the greenhouse gas reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing transmission storage and distribution facilities which may include certain of our facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 in october 2015 the epa amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from gathering and boosting systems completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines   

the epa has continued to adopt greenhouse gas regulations applicable to other industries such as its august 2015 adoption of three separate but related actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants including final carbon pollution standards for new modified and reconstructed power plants a final clean power plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants and a proposed federal plan to implement the clean power plan emission guidelines upon publication of the clean power plan on october 23 2015 more than two dozen states as well as industry and labor groups challenged the clean power plan in the dc circuit court of appeals on february 9 2016 the supreme court stayed the implementation of the clean power plan while legal challenges to the rule proceed as a result of this continued regulatory focus future greenhouse gas regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of greenhouse gases the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly   

in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also on june 29 2016 the leaders of the united states canada and mexico announced an action plan to among other things boost clean energy improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions the action plan specifically calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 by 2025   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business it also remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 us election could impact the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal and state level   

in addition claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act 

in addition the epa plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by june 2018 which would describe a proposed mechanism  regulatory voluntary or a combination of both  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures also on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015  the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration   in particular on may 12 2016 the 

epa amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new modified and reconstructed equipment processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector on the same day the epa finalized a plan to implement its minor new source review program in indian country for oil and natural gas production and it issued for public comment an information request that will require companies to provide extensive information instrumental for the development of regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources these standards as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions impose stringent air permit requirements or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards   andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids   the texas legislature adopted legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process   the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells   

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal  state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing   

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and 

regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases  our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production   

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas   

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices   

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas  we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill   

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas  where we operate the us army corps of engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment decommissioning and site restoration although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements   

natural gas sales and transportation   historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price  of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales ” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties   

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that  we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities   

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services are provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our   costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations   

oil sales and transportation   sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future   

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors   

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to  us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation   texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations  we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us   

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells 

comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 158  full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland and in oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 

availability of company reports 

our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the investor relations page of our website at wwwdiamondbackenergycom as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the sec information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business and properties” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial conditional or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the pending acquisition 

we may not consummate the pending acquisition 

we intend to use the net proceeds from our december 2016 underwritten offering of common stock together with the net proceeds from our concurrent offering of the 2025 senior notes cash on hand and other financing sources to fund the cash consideration for the pending acquisition as described under “item 1 business and propertiesour pending acquisition” however we may not consummate the pending acquisition which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that the pending acquisition will be consummated 

if the pending acquisition is consummated we may be unable to successfully integrate the acquired properties or to realize anticipated revenues or other benefits of the pending acquisition 

our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the pending acquisition will depend in part upon whether we can integrate the acquired properties into our existing businesses in an efficient and effective manner we may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully the successful acquisition of producing properties including those to be acquired in the pending acquisition requires an assessment of several factors including 

 the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain in connection with these assessments we have performed a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review may not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves inspections will not always be performed on every well and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or a portion of the underlying deficiencies the integration process may be subject to delays or changed circumstances and we can give no assurance that the acquired properties will perform in accordance with our expectations significant acquisitions including the pending acquisition and other strategic transactions may involve other risks that may cause our business to suffer including 

 we will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the pending acquisition 

we expect to incur significant costs associated with the pending acquisition and integration andor development of the assets subject to the pending acquisition as part of our operations the substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the pending acquisition will be composed of transaction costs related to the pending acquisition and the costs involved in financing of the pending acquisition we may also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration andor development plans for the assets subject to the pending acquisition 

fraudulent conveyance laws may allow courts under specific circumstances to void the pending acquisition and require the seller to return the consideration received for the pending acquisition 

the pending acquisition may be subject to claims that it should be limited subordinated or voided under applicable law in favor of the seller these laws include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer voidable preference financial assistance corporate purpose or benefit preservation of share capital thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally in general under fraudulent conveyance and similar laws a court might void or otherwise decline to enforce the pending acquisition if it found that when we entered into the pending acquisition the seller received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the pending acquisition and one of the following is true 

 a court might also void the pending acquisition without regard to the above factors if such court found that the seller consummated the pending acquisition with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors 

the measures of insolvency applied by courts will vary depending upon the particular fraudulent transfer law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred in the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or transfer has occurred a court may void or hold unenforceable the pending acquisition 

failure to complete the pending acquisition could negatively impact our future business and financial results 

if the pending acquisition is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the pending acquisition our future business and financial results and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected including the following 

 misrepresentations made to us by the seller could cause us to incur substantial financial obligations and harm our business 

if we were to discover that there were misrepresentations made to us by the seller or its representatives regarding the seller we would explore all possible legal remedies to compensate us for any loss including our rights to indemnification under the purchase agreement for the pending acquisition however there is no assurance that legal remedies would be available or collectible if such unknown liabilities exist and we are not fully indemnified for any loss that we incur as a result thereof we could incur substantial financial obligations which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and harm our business 

the reserve production and other data and estimates with respect to the assets being acquired in the pending acquisition is based primarily on information provided by the seller we have not yet verified these data and estimates and cannot assure you that actual results will not differ materially 

according to data provided by the seller the assets contain existing wells producing approximately 9500 boed of average net production for november 2016 additionally the seller has represented that the assets contain a specified number of gross and net acreage gross and net wells as well as net horizontal well locations based on information from the seller as well as publicly available information with respect to wells in adjacent areas we believe the assets are prospective for four primary target zones we are also relying on internal reserve estimates provided by the seller however none of the above information has been verified by us or our independent reserve engineers and could prove to be inaccurate and in some instances materially so we may have limited recourse against the seller should any of these estimates or other data prove to be inaccurate likewise we may not be able to achieve our 2017 production estimates and the cost of drilling and completing wells on the assets subject to the pending acquisition could prove to be materially higher we cannot assure you that we will achieve the results estimated by us with respect to the assets subject to the pending acquisition 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly the ongoing decline in prices for oil and natural gas have and may continue to adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during the past five years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of  2619 per barrel or bbl in february 2016 to a high of 11062 per bbl in september 2013 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of   149  per mmbtu in march 2016  to a high of 815 per mmbtu in february 2014 during 2016  wti prices ranged from   2619  to 5401   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from   149  to 380   per mmbtu on   january 31 2017  the wti posted price for crude oil was   5275   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 300  per mmbtu representing decreases  of 2  and 21  respectively from the high of 5401  per bbl of oil and 380  per mmbtu for natural gas during 2016  if the prices of oil and natural gas continue at current levels or decline further our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

concerns over general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european asian and the united states financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the global economy these factors combined with volatility in commodity prices business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates have precipitated an economic slowdown concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish further which could impact the price at which we can sell our production affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2016  our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 11801 million  our 2017  capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 8000 million  to 10 billion  representing an increase  of 132  over our 2016  capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2017  could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

 

 

 

 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become 

sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

  

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities   

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations   

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history from inception through december 31 2016  we drilled a total of 523  gross vertical wells and participated in an additional 62  gross nonoperated vertical wells of which 533  wells were completed as producing wells and 52  wells were in various stages of completion if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

at an assumed price of approximately 5000  per bbl wti we currently have approximately 2722  gross  1802  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2016  only 120  of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified approximately 854  horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business through december 31 2016  we are the operator of or have participated in a total of 277  horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

multiwell pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results 

we utilize multiwell pad drilling where practical because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location multiwell pad drilling delays the commencement of production which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2016  we had leases representing 15439  net acres expiring in 2017  1845  net acres expiring in 2018  1772  net acres expiring in 2019  23  net acres expiring in 2020  and no  net acres expiring in 2021  the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2017  we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional fixed price swap fixed price basis swap derivatives or costless collars for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2017 and 2018 production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil 

we use fixed price swap contracts fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on nymex wti pricing the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty under the company’s costless collar contracts we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the call option price the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the put option price these contracts and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 

as of december 31 2016  we had the following commodity contracts in place covering nymex wti crude oil and nymex henry hub natural gas for the production period of january 2017 through december 2017 

 

 

 

 

we have crude oil basis swap contracts priced at a weighted average price of 088  for 5475000  aggregate bbls for the spread between the wti midland price and the wti cushing price with a production period of january 2018 through december 2018 to the extent that the prices of oil and natural gas remain at current levels or decline further we will not be able to economically hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to an agreement with shell trading us company under which we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to shell trading us company our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity this decreased quantity if elected would be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under the oil purchase agreement which may result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 495 million  at december 31 2016  and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 706 million  at december 31 2016  joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell 

trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc  13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value   

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized  we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves  the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 1123  1784  and 2379  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was 1764 million  2161 million  and 1687 million  respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense  beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

impairments on proved oil and natural gas properties of 2455 million  and 8148 million  were recorded for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the year ended december 31 2014  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations–critical accounting policies and estimates–method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting if prices of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids continue to decline we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our estimated reserves  and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves   

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves  as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  which include those attributable to viper are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates  reserve 

estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities–oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future   

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe because they have become uneconomic or otherwise   

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate   

approximately   420   of our total estimated proved reserves as of   december 31 2016  were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves   

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area   

all of our producing properties are currently geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting 

in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of   december 31 2016  all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play in the midland basin this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field   

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc  13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history 

diamondback energy inc commenced business operations on october 11 2012 prior to that time all of our historical oil and natural gas assets operations and results described in this report were those of windsor permian llc and windsor ut llc in connection with our initial public offering windsor permian llc became our whollyowned subsidiary and we acquired 

the oil and natural gas assets of gulfport energy corporation located in the permian basin as a result there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we commenced business operations in october 2012 and growth in accordance with our business plan if achieved could place a significant strain on our financial technical operational and management resources as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas   

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations  and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

  

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by 

our gathering system our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue see item 1 “business–regulation” for a description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of congress to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process furthermore several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act   

in addition the epa plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by june 2018 which would describe a proposed mechanism  regulatory voluntary or a combination of both  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures also on june 28 2016 the epa published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015   the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration    

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources on december 13 2016 the epa released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources finding that under some circumstances the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids    for a more detailed discussion of state and local laws and initiatives concerning hydraulic fracturing see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–regulation of hydraulic fracturing”  we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal  state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing   

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation 

of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws moreover public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the commodities futures trading commission’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the commodities futures trading commission to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the commodities futures trading commission has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the commodities futures trading commission will finalize certain other related rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could 

adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed as a result of future legislation 

 from time to time legislative proposals are made that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws these proposed changes have included but are not limited to i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development iii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and v implementing certain international tax reforms further in february 2016 the former president’s administration issued a proposed budget which includes among other things a proposed tax of 1025 per barrel equivalent on petroleum products 

these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that tax our production or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs while we are subject to certain federal greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives for a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–environmental regulationclimate change”   

in december 2015 the united states participated in the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement went into effect on november 4 2016 the agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also on june 29 2016 the leaders of the united states canada and mexico announced an action plan to among other things boost clean energy improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions the action plan specifically calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 by 2025   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business it also remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 us election could impact the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal and state level   

in addition claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages while our business is not a party to any such litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could 

cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity in addition a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states most recently in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal in response to these concerns regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells for example on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water or other oil and gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well if the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity then the agency may deny modify suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well the commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells 

we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities while these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations these legal requirements are subject to change which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements owing to among other things concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore are exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the natural gas act of 1938 however the distinction between ferc–regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that 

are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed   

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more 

easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties   

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations   

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical   

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry   

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies  as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations   could be materially and adversely affected   

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business   

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations  we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results   

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2016  2015  and 2014  and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we incurred 335 million  246 million  and 143 million  respectively of stock based compensation expense of which we capitalized 71 million  60 million  and 44 million  respectively pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses 

because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business   

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and   our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all   

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss   

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of its vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of its business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business   

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness 

as of december 31 2016  we had total longterm debt of 11 billion  including 10 billion  outstanding under the 2024 senior notes and 2025 senior notes and we had an unused borrowing base availability of 5000 million  under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  viper one of our subsidiaries had 1205 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1545 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility in january 2017 viper repaid its outstanding borrowings in full with a portion of the net proceeds from its public offering of common units we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility the indentures governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering on june 23 2014 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which modified certain provisions of our revolving credit facility to allow us among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under the amended revolving credit facility we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the amended revolving credit facility including the related guaranty and all liens on the assets of and the equity interests in viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary under the amended revolving credit facility were automatically released further viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiaries viper energy partners llc and white fang energy llc are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes 

we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility if default occurs the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing the senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 

availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of 10 billion  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  the borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors as of december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 192  on january 19 2016 the last day on which borrowings were outstanding under such facility we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow further if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination we would be required to repay the excess we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing we may have to sell significant assets any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2016  our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at 10 billion  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  and we had no  outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december 31 2016  viper had 1205 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1545 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility in january 2017 viper repaid its outstanding borrowings in full with a portion of the net proceeds from its public offering of common units further the indentures governing the senior notes allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors the indentures governing the senior notes also allow us to incur certain other additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indentures governing the senior notes do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our and viper’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050  to 150  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150  to 250  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 192  on january 19 2016 the last day on which borrowings were outstanding under such facility viper’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 297  during the year ended december 31 2016  as of december 31 2016  viper had 1205 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1545 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility in january 2017 viper repaid its outstanding borrowings in full with a portion of the net proceeds from its public offering of common units and had 2750 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable wexford our equity sponsor prior to our initial public offering or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 



 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies these transactions include among others real property leased by us from fasken midland llc an entity affiliated with wexford and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts 

we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company which may significantly affect our financial condition 

  

we completed our initial public offering in october 2012 as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules implemented by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such future sales may occur may cause our stock price to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock except for any shares purchased by our affiliates all of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent equity offering are freely tradable in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the market perceives that such sales may occur the price of our stock could decline 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 

as of december 31 2016  we had a net operating loss or nol carry forward of approximately 1391 million  for federal income tax purposes transfers of our stock could result in an ownership change in such a case our ability to use the nols generated through the ownership change date could be limited in general the amount of nols we could use for any tax year after the date of the ownership change would be limited to the value of our stock as of the ownership change date multiplied by the longterm taxexempt rate 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders 

we have not paid dividends since our inception and we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition results of operations contractual restrictions capital requirements business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions as a result only appreciation of the price of our common stock which may not occur will provide a return to our stockholders

operational update 

we are operating six rigs now and currently intend to operate between six and ten drilling rigs in 2017 across our asset base in the midland and delaware basins we plan to operate four to six of these rigs in the midland basin targeting horizontal development of the wolfcamp and spraberry formations while the remainder of the rigs are expected to operate in the delaware basin targeting the wolfcamp and bone spring formations following the closing of our pending acquisition which is expected to occur in february 2017 

in the midland basin we have drilled and completed multiple pads in glasscock county with significant positive results and we anticipate continuing active development on this acreage with one rig in 2017 assuming commodity prices remain steady or increase further we have also drilled and completed three threewell pads in howard county targeting the lower spraberry wolfcamp a and wolfcamp b formations with positive results and plan to continue to operate one rig in this area the remainder of our rigs in the midland basin will focus on our core development area in midland county as well as our acreage in southwest martin county and northeast andrews county targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations 

in the delaware basin we are currently drilling our first operated well in ward county and plan to operate one rig consistently on this acreage through 2017 targeting the wolfcamp and bone spring formations after the closing of our pending acquisition which is expected to occur in february 2017 we plan to operate between one and three rigs on that asset targeting the wolfcamp and bone spring formations as well 

we continue to focus on low cost operations and best in class execution in doing so we are focused on controlling oilfield service costs as our service providers seek to increase pricing after two years of declining service costs during the downturn in the oil market to combat rising service costs we have looked to lock in pricing for dedicated activity levels and will continue to seek opportunities to control additional well cost where possible our 2017 drilling and completion budget includes amount that we believe will cover potential increases in our service costs during the year 

2017  capital budget 

we have currently budgeted a 2017  total capital spend of 8000 million  to 10 billion  consisting of 6500 million  to 8250 million  for horizontal drilling and completions including nonoperated activity and 1500 million  to 1750 million  for infrastructure and other expenditures but excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions we expect to drill and complete 130  to 165  gross horizontal wells in 2017  

operating results overview 

the following table summarizes our average daily production for the periods presented 



our average daily production for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015   increased   9933  boed or 30  

during the year ended december 31 2016  we drilled 73  gross  61  net horizontal wells and two  gross  one net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of 19  gross  five net nonoperated wells in the permian basin 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold production mix or commodity prices 

the following table presents the sources of our revenues for the years presented 



  

since our production consists primarily of oil our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2016  wti posted prices ranged from 2619  to 5401  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 149  to 380  per mmbtu on december 30 2016  the wti posted price for crude oil was 5375  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 371  per mmbtu lower prices may not only decrease our revenues but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit 

from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative expenses  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income expense  we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions this amount reflects interest paid to our lender plus the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees net of interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of the change in the fair value of open nonhedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

deferred tax assets liabilities we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 





 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015   

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased  by approximately 804 million  or 18  to 5271 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 4467 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased  by 9933  boed to 43031  boed during the year ended december 31 2016  from 33098  boed during the year ended december 31 2015  the total increase  in revenue of approximately 804 million  is largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes partially offset by lower average sales prices for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the increases  in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our production increased  by 2480786  bbls of oil 721818  bbls of natural gas liquids and 2797205  mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  

the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 466 million  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 1269 million  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 



 

lease operating expenses  lease operating expenses were 824 million   523  per boe for the year ended december 31 2016  a decrease  of 02 million  from 826 million   684  per boe for the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease  is a result of efficiencies we achieved in our field operations upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells 

production and ad valorem taxes  production and ad valorem taxes increased  to 345 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  from 330 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices the increase in production and ad valorem taxes during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in our production taxes as a result of increased production partially offset by lower ad valorem taxes 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization expense decreased   397 million  or 18  from 2177 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  to 1780 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  

the following table provides components of our depreciation depletion and amortization expense for the periods presented 



the decreases  in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 397 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  resulted primarily from the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded in 2016 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  we recorded impairments of oil and gas properties of 2455 million  and 8148 million  respectively as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices which resulted in a reduction of the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased   107 million  from 320 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  to 426 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase  was due to increases in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce and equitybased compensation 

interest income expense  interest income expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was 407 million  as compared to 415 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  a decrease  of 08 million  this decrease  was due primarily to the lower average level of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during 2016 

gain loss on derivative instruments net  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of 12 million  and 1449 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2016  and 2015  we had a negative change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of 265 million  and 1129 million  respectively 

provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of   02 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to an income tax benefit of 2013 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  our effective tax rate was 01  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 269  for the year ended december 31 2015  

comparison of the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014   

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues decreased by approximately 490 million or 10 to 4467 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 4957 million for the year ended december 31 2014 our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 13624 boed to 33098 boed during the year ended december 31 2015 from 19474 boed during the year ended december 31 2014 the total decrease in revenue of approximately 490 million is largely attributable to lower average sales prices partially offset by higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our production increased by 3699559 bbls of oil 675632 bbls of natural gas liquids and 3585321 mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 3919 million calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 3429 million calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below

production and ad valorem taxes  production and ad valorem taxes increased to 330 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 326 million for the year ended december 31 2014 in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during the year ended december 31 2015 our production taxes per boe decreased by 186 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes in 2015 offset by an increased production as a result of our acquisitions and drilling 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization expense increased 477 million or 28 from 1700 million for the year ended december 31 2014 to 2177 million for the year ended december 31 2015 

the following table provides components of our depreciation depletion and amortization expense for the periods presented 



the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 474 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 resulted primarily from higher total production levels and an increase in net book value on new reserves on a per boe basis depreciation depletion and amortization decreased primarily due to the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded in 2015 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded an impairment of oil and natural gas properties of 8148 million as a result of the significant decline in prices in 2015 no impairment was recorded during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses increased 107 million from 213 million for the year ended december 31 2014 to 320 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was due to increases in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce and equitybased compensation 

interest income expense  interest income expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was 415 million as compared to 345 million for the year ended december 31 2014 an increase of 70 million this increase was due primarily to the higher average level of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during 2015

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3321 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 4165 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the decrease  in operating cash flows is primarily the result of a higher gain on settlement of derivative instruments during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4165 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 3564 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 700 increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 470 decrease in our net realized sales prices 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “–sources of our revenue” and item 1a “risk factors” above

elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  as of december 31 2016  we had no  outstanding borrowings and 5000 million  available for future borrowings under this facility 

  

the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by us that is equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050  to 150  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150  to 250  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0375  to 0500  per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage and is required to be repaid a to the extent that the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise in some cases subject to a cure period b in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and c at the maturity date of november 1 2018 

the credit agreement contains various affirmative negative and financial maintenance covenants these covenants among other things limit additional indebtedness additional liens sales of assets mergers and consolidations dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below

viper is a party to a 5000 million  secured revolving credit agreement dated as of july 8 2014 as amended with wells fargo as the administrative agent sole book runner and lead arranger and certain other lenders party thereto the credit agreement matures on july 8 2019 on august 5 2016 viper repaid 780 million  of its outstanding borrowings with a portion of the proceeds from its august 2016 public offering of common units and as of december 31 2016  the borrowing base was set at 2750 million  and viper had 1205 million  in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement upon completion of viper’s january 2017 underwritten public offering of common units viper repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit agreement and as of february 13 2017 had no borrowings outstanding under this facility 

the outstanding borrowings under viper’s credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by viper that is equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050  to 150  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150  to 250  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base viper is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0375  to 0500  per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage and is required to be repaid a to the extent that the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise in some cases subject to a cure period and b at the maturity date of july 8 2019 the loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of viper and its subsidiaries 

the viper credit agreement contains various affirmative negative and financial maintenance covenants these covenants among other things limit additional indebtedness purchases of margin stock additional liens sales of assets mergers and consolidations dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below 



the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to 2500 million  in the form of senior unsecured notes and in connection with any such issuance the reduction of the borrowing base by 25  of the stated principal amount of each such issuance a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid 

the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under viper’s revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default viper’s credit agreement contains customary events of default including nonpayment breach of covenants materially incorrect representations crossdefault bankruptcy and change of control there are no cure periods for events of default due to nonpayment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants but nonpayment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods 

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2017  capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of 8000 million  to 10 billion  representing an increase  of 132  over our 2016  capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2016  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were 3643 million  we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted during the year ended december 31 2016  we spent approximately 6113 million  on acquisitions of leasehold interests 

the amount and timing of these capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners with recent improvement in oil prices we are currently operating six horizontal rigs and two completion crews we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions 

based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2017  we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2017  however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2017  capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures 

necessary to replace our reserves further if the decline in commodity prices continue our revenues cash flows results of operations liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  



 

critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of 

acquired assets and liabilities equitybased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser net of royalty interests discounts and allowances as applicable we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves no receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided 

impairment 

we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under this method all acquisition exploration and development costs including certain internal costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of 

production method based on proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three  to five  years sales of oil and natural gas properties whether or not being amortized currently are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas 

under this method of accounting we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter the test determines a limit or ceiling on the book value of the proved oil and gas properties net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum from proved reserves based on the trailing 12month unweighted average of the firstdayofthemonth price adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet b the cost of properties not being amortized if any and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties if the net book value including related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling an impairment or noncash writedown is required 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 

accounting for equitybased compensation 

we grant various types of equitybased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 10 –equitybased compensation stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts 

and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

recent accounting pronouncements

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2016  please read note 15  included in notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives including basis swaps to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil and natural gas sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on nymex wti 

  

at december 31 2016  we had a net liability derivative position of 226 million  related to our price swap and price basis swap derivatives as compared to a net asset derivative position of 46 million  as of december 31 2015  related to our price swap and price basis swap derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps and fixed price basis swaps as of december 31 2016  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net liability position to 407 million  an increase of 180 million  while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net liability derivative position to 46 million  a decrease of 180 million  however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 495 million  at december 31 2016  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 706 million  at december 31 2016  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2016  three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   45  koch supply  trading lp  15  and enterprise crude oil llc  13  for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2016  we had three  customers that represented approximately 75  of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2015  we had five  customer that represented approximately 73  of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050  to 150  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150  to 250  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base 

as of december 31 2016  we had no  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 192  on january 19 2016 the last day on which borrowings were outstanding under such facility an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or 

increase in our interest expense of approximately 01 million based on the 110 million outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility as of such date

evaluation of disclosure control and procedures 

 under the direction of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms the disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

as of december 31 2016  an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15b under the exchange act based upon our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2016  our disclosure controls and procedures are effective

 item 1 business and properties 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174  net acres in the permian basin at december 31 2015  our total net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 84683  net acres in addition we through our subsidiary viper energy partners lp or viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 46562  gross  17060  net acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 60  of these net acres are operated by us on june 23 2014 viper completed its initial public offering of 5750000  common units representing limited partner interests and on september 19 2014 viper completed a followon underwritten public offering of 3500000  common units the common units sold to the public represent in the aggregate an approximate 12  limited partner interest in viper we own viper energy partners gp llc the general partner of viper which we refer to as the general partner and the remaining approximate 88  limited partner interest in viper 

our activities are primarily focused on the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations which we refer to collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates the wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the spraberry play the majority of which is designated in the spraberry trend area field according to the us energy information administration the spraberry trend area ranked as the second largest oilfield in the united states based on 2009 reserves 

as of december 31 2015  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 156900  mboe which includes estimated reserves of 26345  mboe attributable to the mineral interests owned by viper based on reserve reports prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 59  are classified as proved developed producing proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 107  gross  86  net horizontal well locations and 3  gross  2  net vertical well locations on 40 acre spacing in which we have a working interest and 16  horizontal wells in which we own only a mineral interest through our subsidiary viper as of december 31 2015  our estimated proved reserves were approximately 67  oil 17  natural gas liquids and 16  natural gas 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data we currently have approximately 1500  gross  960  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately 4000  per bbl wti we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves 

the challenging commodity price environment that we experienced in 2015  has continued in 2016  with the posted price of wti dropping to as low as 2668  in january 2016 nevertheless we believe we remain wellpositioned in this environment during 2015  we again demonstrated our operational focus on achieving bestinclass execution lowcost operations and a conservative balance sheet as we continued to reduce drilling days well costs and operating expenses while maintaining what we believe to be a peer leading leverage ratio we intend to continue our operational focus in 2016  emphasizing financial discipline over growth we currently intend to release one of our three horizontal drilling rigs in march 2016 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and accelerate our drilling program if commodity prices improve we have the option to release a second rig in the second quarter of 2016 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” 

our business strategy 

our business strategy is to continue to profitably grow our business through the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrowing as of december 31 2015  as of december 31 2015  viper had 345 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1655 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility 

our strengths 

we believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals 

 

 

 

 

 

cost efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes additionally as the operator of substantially all of our acreage we retain the ability to increase or decrease our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks this operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects 

our properties 

location and land 

our total net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 84683  net acres at december 31 2015  we are the operator of approximately 96  of this permian basin acreage in addition we through our subsidiary viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 46562  gross  17060  net acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 60  of these net acres are operated by us since our initial acquisition in the permian basin through december 31 2015  we drilled or participated in the drilling of 490  gross  407  net wells on our leasehold acreage in this area primarily targeting the wolfberry play the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play as of december 31 2015  we held working interests in 918  gross  732  net producing wells 

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid mississippianpennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the ouachita fold belt it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations in this report we refer to the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp strawn and atoka formations collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play of the midland basin lies in the area where the historically productive spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of the emerging wolfcamp play 

the spraberry was deposited as turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberry and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the shales themselves and in the more conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs between the shales the wolfberry is an unconventional “basincentered oil” resource play in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

  

we have successfully developed several shale intervals within the clearfork spraberry and wolfcamp formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the shales exhibit microdarcy permeabilities which result in relatively small drainage areas and recovery factors so relatively small interwell spacing is necessary 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 698  square miles of 3d data and we are in the process of acquiring an additional 19  square miles this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling activities and to identify and avoid potential geohazards eg faults and lithologies that are difficult to drill 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2015  net production from our permian basin acreage was 12080631  boe or an average of 33098  boed of which approximately 75  was oil 14  was natural gas liquids and 11  was natural gas 

facilities 

our oil and natural gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilnatural gaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

  

future activity 

during 2016  we expect to drill an estimated 30  to 70  gross  25  to 58  net horizontal wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2016  will be between 2500 million  and 3750 million  consisting of 2100 million  to 3150 million  for horizontal drilling and completions 250 million  to 350 million  for infrastructure and 150 million  to 250 million  for nonoperated activity and other expenditures but excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2015  we drilled 64  gross  54  net and completed 65  gross  54  net horizontal wells we drilled and completed four  gross  three net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of 15  gross  six net nonoperated wells in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2015  our capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells was 3580 million  we spent 270 million  for oil and gas infrastructure and 340 million  for nonoperated properties we spent an additional 4814 million  for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

we intend to release one of our three horizontal drilling rigs in march 2016 we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans as conditions warrant we are prepared to decelerate our drilling program if commodity prices deteriorate and accelerate our drilling program if commodity prices improve we have the option to release a second rig in the second quarter of 2016 and continue to operate one rig 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2015  were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the 

definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 90 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 10 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our vice president–reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our vice president–reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 24 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 



 

the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“risk factors” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2015  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 45409  mbbls of oil 52632  mmcf of natural gas and 10586  mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 64767  mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2015  



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 44755  mboe from continued successful horizontal development of the lower spraberry and wolfcamp b horizons and initial development of the wolfcamp a and middle spraberry intervals on our acreage approximately 63  of the extensions are classified as proved undeveloped approximately 20  of the proved undeveloped reserve extensions are associated with well locations that are more than one offset away from existing producing wells all of these locations are within 1700  feet of producing wells partially offsetting the increase in proved undeveloped reserves were decreases due to technical revisions downward revisions of approximately 12656  mboe were a result of reclassifying 14619  mboe of reserves attributable to 80  vertical wells and 22 horizontal wells in which we have a working interest and 22 vertical wells in which we have only a mineral interest held through viper due to lower product prices vertical well reclassifications accounted for 8607  mboe of the total of 14619  mboe these vertical locations were also unlikely to be developed within the fiveyear period required by the applicable sec rules even if commodity prices recover due to our focus on horizontal well development as of december 31 2015  horizontal wells represented approximately 997  of our pud locations 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 427 million  during 2015  estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 1340 million  in 2016  1740 million  in 2017  1360 million  in 2018  and 360 million  in 2019  since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

our december 31 2015 proved reserves were calculated using prices based on the 12month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthe month price for the period january through december 2015 of 5028 per bbl and 258 per mmbtu holding production and development costs constant if sec pricing had been the december 31 2015 pricing of 3704 per bbl and 234 per mmbtu this would have resulted in a decrease of 20005 mboe of our estimated pud reserves 

as of december 31 2015  all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five  years from the date they were initially recorded 

as of december 31 2015  less than 10  of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and natural gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 



 

productive wells 

as of december 31 2015  we owned an average unweighted 80  working interest in 1029  gross  820  net productive wells through our subsidiary viper we own an average unweighted 19 royalty or mineral interest in 130 additional productive wells in which we do not own a working interest productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2015  relating to our leasehold acreage 



 

undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2015  that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



as of december 31 2015  we had 44  gross  34  net wells in the process of drilling completing or dewatering or shut in awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table 

title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp   37  and shell trading us company   37  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed however based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers 

on may 24 2012 we entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company in which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to shell trading us company upon completion of the reversal of the magellan longhorn pipeline and its conversion for oil shipment which occurred on october 1 2013 our agreement with shell trading us company has an initial term of five years from the completion date the agreement may also be terminated by shell trading us company by written notice to us in the event that shell trading us company’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to elect to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity which decreased contract quantity will be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement shell trading us company has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the nymex over the onemonth period as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in the agreement if we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement during any threemonth period following the service commencement date we have agreed to pay shell trading us company a deficiency payment which is calculated by multiplying i the volume of oil that we failed to deliver as required under the agreement during such period by ii magellan’s longhorn spot tariff rate in effect for transportation from crane texas to the houston ship channel for the period of time for which such deficiency volume is calculated 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human 

resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production currently a majority of our production is transported to the purchaser by pipeline which we anticipate will increase to approximately 90 for oil by the end of 2016 

during 2015 several oil and saltwater disposal gathering systems were installed at december 31 2015  approximately 83  of our produced water was connected to saltwater disposals by pipe and approximately 67  of our oil production was sold by pipe these initiatives reduced the cost of the water which was being trucked to disposal by approximately 143 bbl and reduced the transportation cost of the oil being sold by truck by 075 bbl we believe that these gathering systems will help us reduce our lease operating expense and improve our margins on sales in future periods 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1875  to 2500  resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 8125  to 7500  

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our o il and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the epa issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from  our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities liability under such laws and regulations is strict ie no showing of “fault” is required and can be joint and several moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our  operations and financial position as well as the oil and 

natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling   the resource conservation and recovery act as amended and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions moreover the epa or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses   

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended which we refer to as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally imposes liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released   

water discharges   the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak these laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on april 7 2015 the epa published a proposed rule establishing federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works or potw which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions   

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the oil pollution act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the 

requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the oil pollution act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that in some circumstances may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters   

noncompliance with the clean water act or the oil pollution act may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations  we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions   the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “–regulation of hydraulic fracturing” these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects   

climate change in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities in response to its endangerment finding the epa adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act the motor vehicle rule which became effective in july 2010 purports to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles the epa adopted the stationary source rule which we refer to as the tailoring rule in may 2010 and it became effective january 2011 the tailoring rule established new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the psd and title v programs of the clean air act on june 23 2014 in utility air regulatory group v epa  the supreme court held that stationary sources could not become subject to psd or title v permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions the court ruled however that the epa may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the psd and title v programs on december 19 2014 the epa issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on greenhouse gas permitting requirements in response to the court’s decision in utility air regulatory group v epa  in its preliminary guidance the epa indicates it will undertake a rulemaking action to rescind any psd permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the court in the interim the epa issued a narrowly crafted “no action assurance” indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to greenhouse gases in an epaissued psd permit and for related terms and conditions in a title v permit on april 30 2015 the epa issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind psd permits issued under the invalid regulations   

additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in november 2010 the epa expanded the greenhouse gas reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing transmission storage and distribution facilities which may include certain of our facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 in october 2015 the epa amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from gathering and boosting systems completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines   

the epa has continued to adopt greenhouse gas regulations applicable to other industries such as its august 2015 adoption of three separate but related actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants including final carbon pollution standards for new modified and reconstructed power plants a final clean power plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants and a proposed federal plan to implement the clean power plan emission guidelines upon publication of the clean power plan on october 23 2015 more than two dozen states as well as industry and labor groups challenged the 

clean power plan in the dc circuit court of appeals as a result of this continued regulatory focus future greenhouse gas regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of greenhouse gases the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly   

in december 2015 the united states joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement if ratified establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business   

in addition claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages while our business is not a party to this litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act furthermore legislation to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process have been proposed in recent sessions of congress   

in addition on may 9 2014 the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing the epa plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by december 2016 which would describe a proposed mechanism  regulatory voluntary or a combination of both  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures also on april 7 2015 the epa published a proposed rule establishing federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to potw the epa asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt potw operations andor be discharged untreated from the potw to receiving waters if adopted the new pretreatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to a potw the public comment period ended on july 17 2015 and the epa is expected to publish a final rule by august 2016 the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and gas 

extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015  the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration   in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration for example in september 2013 and december 2014 the epa amended its rules to extend compliance deadlines and to clarify the nsp standards further on july 31 2015 the epa finalized two updates to the nsp standards to address the definition of lowpressure wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another referred to as connected in parallel in addition on september 18 2015 the epa published a suite of proposed rules to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from oil and gas industry including new “downstream” requirements covering equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry that was not regulated by the 2012 rules the public comment period closed on december 4 2015  we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty 

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in june 2015 the epa released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment finding that while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread systemic impacts also on february 6 2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards   andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids   the texas legislature adopted new legislation effective september 1 2011 requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process   the texas railroad commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the texas railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the new law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission also in may 2013 the texas railroad commission adopted new rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the new rules took effect in january 2014 additionally on october 28 2014 the texas railroad commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments which became effective on november 17 2014 also clarify the texas railroad commission’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the texas railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells   

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations 

that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal  state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing   

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases  our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production   

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas   

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices   

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas  we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill   

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas  where we operate the us army corps of engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment decommissioning and site restoration although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements   

natural gas sales and transportation   historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price  of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales ” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties   

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that  we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities   

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services are provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our   costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations   

oil sales and transportation   sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future   

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors   

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to  us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation   texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure  you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations  we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us   

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see item 1a “risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 141  full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland and in oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 

availability of company reports 

our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the investor relations page of our website at wwwdiamondbackenergycom as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in item 1 “business” and item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial conditional or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly the ongoing decline in prices for oil and natural gas have and may continue to adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during the past six years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of  3455 per barrel or bbl in december 2015 

to a high of 11339 per bbl in april 2011 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of   163  per mmbtu in january 2016  to a high of 815 per mmbtu in february 2014 during 2015  wti prices ranged from   3455  to 6136   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from   163  to 332   per mmbtu on   january 20 2016  the wti posted price for crude oil was   2668   per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 228  per mmbtu representing decreases  of 57  and 31  respectively from the high of 6136  per bbl of oil and 332  per mmbtu for natural gas during 2015  if the prices of oil and natural gas continue at current levels or decline further our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

concerns over general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european asian and the united states financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the global economy these factors combined with volatility in commodity prices business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates have precipitated an economic slowdown concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish further which could impact the price at which we can sell our production affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations and our ability to complete acquisitions require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2015  our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 9009 million  our 2016  capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 2500 million  to 3750 million  representing a decrease  of 26  over our 2015  capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2016  could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

 

 

 

 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

  

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities   

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations   

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history from inception through december 31 2015  we drilled a total of 448  gross wells and participated in an additional 42  gross nonoperated wells of which 446  wells were completed as producing wells and 44  wells were in various stages of completion if future wells or the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

at an assumed price of approximately 4000  per bbl wti we currently have approximately 1500  gross  960  net identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2015  only 107  of our gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations and three  of our identified vertical drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified approximately 690  horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business while through december 31 2015  we are the operator of or have participated in a total of 184  horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

multiwell pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results 

we utilize multiwell pad drilling where practical because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location multiwell pad drilling delays the commencement of production which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2015  we had leases representing 6007  net acres expiring in 2016  15142  net acres expiring in 2017  no  net acres expiring in 2018  no  net acres expiring in 2019  and 21  net acres expiring in 2020  the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2016 we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

we have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional price swap derivatives for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2016  production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on intercontinental exchange or ice pricing for brent crude oil the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty these contracts and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 

as of december 31 2015  we had crude oil swap contracts in place covering ice brent crude oil priced at a weighted average price of 8872  for 91000  aggregate bbls for the production period of january through february 2016 as of february 17 2016 we had not entered into any significant hedging transactions with respect to our anticipated 2016  production to the extent that the price of oil remains at current levels or declines further we will not be able to hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities production related difficulties or otherwise we may fail to meet our obligations to deliver specified quantities of oil under our oil purchase contract which will result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

we are a party to an agreement with shell trading us company under which we are obligated to deliver specified quantities of oil to shell trading us company our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity which decreased quantity will be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement if production from our permian basin acreage decreases due to decreased developmental activities as a result of the low commodity price environment production related difficulties or otherwise we may be unable to meet our obligations under the oil purchase agreement which may result in deficiency payments to the counterparty and may have an adverse effect on our operations 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 413 million  at december 31 2015  and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 376 million  at december 31 2015  joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp   37  and shell trading us company   37  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value   

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized  we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change  income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves  the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 1784  2379  and 2463  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  was 2161 million  1687 million  and 658 million  respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense  beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

an impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties of 8148 million  was recorded for the year ended december 31 2015  no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations–critical accounting policies and estimates–method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting if prices of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids continue to decline we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties which could negatively affect our results of operations 

our estimated reserves  and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves   

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves  as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  which include those attributable to viper are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates  reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods commodity prices have deteriorated significantly since that time and accordingly using more recent prices in estimating our proved reserves without giving effect to any acquisition or development activities we have executed during 2016 would result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities–oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future   

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe because they have become uneconomic or otherwise   

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate   

approximately   413   of our total estimated proved reserves as of   december 31 2015  were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or further decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves   

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area   

all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of   december 31 2015  all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field   

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading 

us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp   37  and shell trading us company   37  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods  we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these customers and our inability to sell our production to other customers on terms we consider acceptable could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations over the past several years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history 

diamondback energy inc commenced business operations on october 11 2012 prior to that time all of our historical oil and natural gas assets operations and results described in this report were those of windsor permian llc and windsor ut llc in connection with our initial public offering windsor permian llc became our whollyowned subsidiary and we acquired the oil and natural gas assets of gulfport energy corporation located in the permian basin as a result there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we commenced business operations in october 2012 and growth in accordance with our business plan if achieved could place a significant strain on our financial technical operational and management resources as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas   

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations  and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

  

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue see item 1 “business–regulation” for a description of certain laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process which involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions however several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the underground injection control program specifically as “class ii” underground injection control wells under the safe drinking water act furthermore legislation to amend the safe drinking water act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process have been proposed in recent sessions of congress   

in addition on may 9 2014 the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing the epa plans to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking by december 2016 which would describe a proposed mechanism  regulatory voluntary or a combination of both  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures also on april 7 2015 the epa published a proposed rule establishing federal pretreatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to potw the epa asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt potw operations andor be discharged untreated from the potw to receiving waters if adopted the new pretreatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to a potw the public comment period ended on july 17 2015 and the epa is expected to publish a final rule by august 2016 the epa is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities also known as centralized waste treatment or cwt facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater the epa is collecting data and information related to the extent to which cwt facilities accept such wastewater available treatment technologies and their associated costs discharge characteristics financial characteristics of cwt facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from cwt facilities   

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015   the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed in response the epa has issued and will likely continue to issue revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration    

furthermore there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in june 2015 the epa released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment finding that while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread systemic impacts also on february 6 

2015 the epa released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells the report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injectioninduced seismic events other governmental agencies including the us department of energy the us geological survey and the us government accountability office have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business   

several states including texas   and local jurisdictions   have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids    for a more detailed discussion of state and local laws and initiatives concerning hydraulic fracturing see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–regulation of hydraulic fracturing”  we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids induced seismic activity impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal  state or local level   our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal  state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing   

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws moreover public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the commodities futures trading commission’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the commodities futures trading commission to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the commodities futures trading commission has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the commodities futures trading commission will finalize certain other related rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed as a result of future legislation 

from time to time legislative proposals are made that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws these proposed changes have included but are not limited to i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling 

and development costs ii eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development iii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and v implementing certain international tax reforms further in february 2016 the president’s administration issued a proposed budget which includes among other things a proposed tax of 1025 per barrel equivalent on petroleum products  

these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that tax our production or reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in recent years federal state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the epa has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions almost onehalf of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas capandtrade programs while we are subject to certain federal greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives for a description of existing and proposed greenhouse gas rules and regulations see “items 1 and 2 business and properties–regulation–environmental regulationclimate change”   

in december 2015 the united states joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris france the resulting paris agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases the agreement if ratified establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions   

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business   

in addition claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal andor state common law as a result private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages while our business is not a party to this litigation we could be named in actions making similar allegations an unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition   

moreover there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations   

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore are exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the natural gas act of 1938 however the distinction between ferc–regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities 

are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable 

a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed   

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties   

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations   

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical   

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry   

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies  as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations   could be materially and adversely affected   

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business   

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial 

markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations  we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results   

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2015  2014  and 2013  and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we incurred 246 million  143 million  and 27 million  respectively of stock based compensation expense of which we capitalized 60 million  44 million  and 10 million  respectively pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business   

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and   our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all   

we are subject to cyber security risks a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft data corruption operational disruption andor financial loss   

the oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration development production and processing activities for example the oil and natural gas industry depends on digital technologies to interpret seismic data manage drilling rigs production equipment and gathering systems conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation and process and record financial and operating data at the same time cyber incidents including deliberate attacks or unintentional events have increased the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats our technologies systems networks and those of its vendors suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of proprietary and other information or other disruption of its business operations in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents we do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business   

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness 

as of december 31 2015  we had total longterm debt of 4955 million  including 4500 million  outstanding under the senior notes and we had unused borrowing base availability of 4890 million  under our revolving credit facility as of 

december 31 2015  viper one of our subsidiaries had 345 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1655 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility the indenture governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering on june 23 2014 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which modified certain provisions of our revolving credit facility to allow us among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under the amended revolving credit facility we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the amended revolving credit facility including the related guaranty and all liens on the assets of and the equity interests in viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary under the amended revolving credit facility were automatically released further in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the senior notes and upon such designation viper energy partners llc which was a guarantor under the indenture governing the senior notes prior to such designation was released as a guarantor under the indenture governing the senior notes 

we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility if default occurs the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 

availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of 7500 million  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  the borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding borrowings of 110 million  which bore a weighted average interest rate of 192  we intend to continue borrowing under our revolving credit facility in the future any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow further if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination we would be required to repay the excess we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing we may have to sell significant assets any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more 

alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2015  our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at 7500 million  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  and we had outstanding borrowings of 110 million  under this facility as of december 31 2015  viper had 345 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1655 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility in addition the indenture governing the senior notes allows us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors the indenture governing the senior notes also allows us to incur certain other additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indenture governing the senior notes does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

if we experience liquidity concerns we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to and negatively impact the terms of current or future financings or trade credit 

our ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix and commodity pricing levels a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs 

borrowings under our and viper’s revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050  to 150  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150  to 250  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2015  we had 110 million  in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings from our revolving credit facility was 192  during the year ended december 31 2015  viper’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 170  during the year ended december 31 2015  as of december 31 2015  viper one of our subsidiaries had 345 million  in outstanding borrowings and 1655 million  available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable wexford our equity sponsor prior to our initial public offering or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 

 

 

these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

wexford continues to own shares of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders 

as of february 12 2016  wexford beneficially owned less than 1  of our common stock in addition an individual affiliated with wexford serves as the chairman of our board of directors as a result wexford may be able to exercise influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions the interests of wexford with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us such as future acquisitions financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies these transactions include among others drilling services provided to us by bison real property leased by us from fasken midland llc and hydraulic fracturing sand purchased by us from muskie each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with wexford and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts 

we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company which may significantly affect our financial condition 

  

we completed our initial public offering in october 2012 as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules implemented by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for 

our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such future sales may occur may cause our stock price to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock except for any shares purchased by our affiliates all of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent equity offering are freely tradable in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the market perceives that such sales may occur the price of our stock could decline 

a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 

as of december 31 2015 we had a net operating loss or nol carry forward of approximately 826 million for federal income tax purposes transfers of our stock could result in an ownership change in such a case our ability to use the nols generated through the ownership change date could be limited in general the amount of nols we could use for any tax year after the date of the ownership change would be limited to the value of our stock as of the ownership change date multiplied by the longterm taxexempt rate 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified 

events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders 

we have not paid dividends since our inception and we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition results of operations contractual restrictions capital requirements business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions as a result only appreciation of the price of our common stock which may not occur will provide a return to our stockholders

operating results overview 

during the year ended december 31 2015  our average daily production was approximately 33098  boed consisting of 24880  bblsd of oil 21729  mcfd of natural gas and 4596  bblsd of natural gas liquids an increase of 13624  boed or 70  from average daily production of 19474  boed for the year ended december 31 2014  consisting of 14744  bblsd of oil 11907  mcfd of natural gas and 2745  bblsd of natural gas liquids 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we drilled 64  gross  544  net horizontal wells and four  gross  three net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of 15  gross  six net nonoperated wells in the permian basin 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives for the year ended december 31 2015  our revenues were derived 91  from oil sales 5  from natural gas liquids sales and 4  from natural gas sales for the year ended december 31 2014  our revenues were derived 91  from oil sales 6  from natural gas liquids sales and 3  from natural gas sales for the year ended december 31 2013  our revenues were derived 91  from oil sales 6  from natural gas liquids sales and 3  from natural gas sales our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold production mix or commodity prices 

since our production consists primarily of oil our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2015  west texas intermediate posted prices ranged from 3455  to 6136  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 163  to 332  per mmbtu on december 31 2015  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was 3713  per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 228  per mmbtu 

over the past several months oil prices have declined from over 6100  per bbl in june 2015  to below 2700  per bbl in january 2016  due in large part to increasing supplies and weakening demand growth lower prices may not only decrease our revenues but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment expense  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income  this represents the interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense  we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions we reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense in addition we include the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense 

gainloss on derivative instruments  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of the change in the fair value of open nonhedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

loss from equity investment  this line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our investment in the membership interests of muskie an equity method investment 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues decreased  by approximately 490 million  or 10  to 4467 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 4957 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased  by 13624  boed to 33098  boed during the year ended december 31 2015  from 19474  boed during the year ended december 31 2014  the total decrease  in revenue of approximately 490 million  is largely attributable to lower average sales prices partially offset by higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the increases  in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our production increased  by 3699559  bbls of oil 675632  bbls of natural gas liquids and 3585321  mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  

the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 3919 million  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 3429 million  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 



 

lease operating expense  lease operating expense was 826 million   684  per boe for the year ended december 31 2015  an increase  of 272 million  or 49  from 554 million   779  per boe for the year ended december 31 2014  the increase  is due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions which resulted in 169  additional producing wells for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells 

production and ad valorem tax expense  production and ad valorem taxes increased  to 330 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  from 326 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during the year ended december 31 2015  our production taxes per boe decreased by 186  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes in 2015 offset by an increased production as a result of our acquisitions and drilling 

depreciation depletion and amortization expense  depreciation depletion and amortization expense increased   477 million  or 28  from 1700 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  to 2177 million  for the year ended december 31 2015

the increases  in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 474 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  resulted primarily from higher total production levels and an increase in net book value on new reserves on a per boe basis depreciation depletion and amortization decreased primarily due to the impairment of oil and gas properties recorded in 2015 

impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded an impairment of oil and natural gas properties of 8148 million  as a result of the significant decline in prices in 2015 no impairment was recorded in 2014

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4165 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 3564 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the increase  in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 700  increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 470  decrease in our net realized sales prices 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3564 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 1558 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase  in operating cash flows is primarily a result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 1660  increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 104  decrease in our net realized sales prices 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “–sources of our revenue” and item 1a “risk factors” above

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2016  capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of 2500 million  to 3750 million  representing a decrease  of 26  over our 2015  capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2015  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were 4195 million  we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted during the year ended december 31 2015  we spent approximately 4375 million  on acquisitions of leasehold interests 

the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners we currently intend to release one of our three horizontal drilling rigs in march 2016 and we have the option to release a second rig in the second quarter of 2016 

based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2016  we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2016  however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2016  capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves further if the decline in commodity continues our revenues cash flows results of operations liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2015  



 

critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities equitybased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser net of royalty interests discounts and allowances as applicable we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves no receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided 

impairment 

we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under this method all acquisition exploration and development costs including certain internal costs are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three  to five  years sales of oil and natural gas properties whether or not being amortized currently are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas 

under this method of accounting we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter the test determines a limit or ceiling on the book value of the proved oil and gas properties net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 per annum from proved reserves based on the trailing 12month unweighted average of the firstdayofthemonth price adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet b the cost of properties not being amortized if any and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties if the net book value including related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling an impairment or noncash writedown is required 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 

accounting for equitybased compensation 

we grant various types of equitybased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 10 –equitybased compensation stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” this update supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in gaap and requires i an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services and ii requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers the standard will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 with early application not permitted the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented  we are currently evaluating the impact if any that the adoption of this update will have on  our financial position results of operations and liquidity   

in april 2015 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201503 “interest–imputation of interest” this update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability except costs associated with revolving debt arrangements be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from that debt liability consistent with the presentation of a debt discount to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 early application will be permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued adoption of the new guidance will only affect the presentation of  our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on  our consolidated financial statements   

in july 2015 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201511 “inventory” this update applies to all inventory that is not measured using lastin firstout or the retail inventory method under this update an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value this standard will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within those fiscal years this standard should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this update will have on  our financial position results of operations and liquidity   

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201517 “income taxes” this update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early application will be permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period this standard may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented adoption of the new guidance will only affect the presentation of  our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on  our consolidated financial statements   

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015  please read note 15  included in notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on argus louisiana light sweet pricing 

  

at december 31 2015  we had a net asset derivative position of 46 million  related to our price swap derivatives as compared to a net asset derivative position of 1175 million  as of december 31 2014  related to our price swap derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps as of december 31 2015  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position to 43 million  a decrease of 03 million  while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position to 50 million  an increase of 03 million  however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 413 million  at december 31 2015  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 376 million  at december 31 2015  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2015  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   59  and enterprise crude oil llc   15  for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company   64  and enterprise crude oil llc   16  for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp   37  and shell trading us company   37  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2015  we had five  customers that represented approximately 73  of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2014  we had two  customer that represented approximately 61  of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05  and 3month libor plus 10  or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050  to 150  in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150  to 250  in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding 

in relation to the borrowing base our weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was 192  at december 31 2015  an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our interest expense of approximately 01 million  based on the 110 million  outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility on december 31 2015

 item 1 business and properties 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174 net acres with production at the time of acquisition of approximately 800 boed from 34 gross 168 net wells in the permian basin subsequently we acquired approximately 81195 additional net acres which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to approximately 85369 net acres at december 31 2014  in addition we through our subsidiary viper energy partners lp or viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 24528 gross 15948 net acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 43 of these net acres are operated by us on june 23 2014 viper completed its initial public offering of 5750000 common units representing limited partner interests and on september 19 2014 viper completed a followon underwritten public offering of 3500000 common units the common units sold to the public represent in the aggregate an approximate 12 limited partner interest in viper we own viper energy partners gp llc the general partner of viper which we refer to as the general partner and the remaining approximate 88 limited partner interest in viper 

our activities are primarily focused on the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations which we refer to collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates the wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the spraberry play the majority of which is designated in the spraberry trend area field according to the us energy information administration the spraberry trend area ranked as the second largest oilfield in the united states based on 2009 reserves 

as of december 31 2014  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 112832 mboe which includes estimated reserves of 18510 mboe attributable to the mineral interests owned by viper based on reserve reports prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 57 are classified as proved developed producing or pdp proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 79 gross 64 net horizontal well locations and 87 gross 73 net vertical well locations on 40acre spacing in which we have a working interest and ten horizontal wells and 25 vertical wells in which we own only a mineral interest through our subsidiary viper as of december 31 2014  our estimated proved reserves were approximately 67 oil 16 natural gas liquids and 17 natural gas 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data as of december 31 2014  we had 2185 gross 1646 net identified potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as well as 786 gross 746 net identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40acre spacing and an additional 1084 gross 996 net identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20acre downspacing we intend to continue to grow our reserves and production through development drilling exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves 

our business strategy 

our business strategy is to continue to profitably grow our business through the following 

 

additional 1084 gross 996 net vertical locations based on 20acre downspacing as of december 31 2014  we were operating five horizontal rigs and one vertical rig   we intend to release two horizontal rigs and one vertical rig in february 2015 and continue with three horizontal rigs two of which will operate in spanish trail 

 

 

 

 

 

our strengths 

we believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals 

 

 

experience in the permian basin in addition our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing horizontal wells as well as horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise which will be of strategic importance as we expand our horizontal drilling activity prior to joining us our chief executive officer held management positions at apache corporation laredo petroleum holdings inc and burlington resources 

 our properties 

location and land 

we acquired approximately 4174 net acres in west texas near midland in the permian basin in december 2007 subsequently we acquired approximately 81195 additional net acres which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to approximately 85369 net acres at december 31 2014  we are the operator of approximately 95 of this permian basin acreage in addition we through our subsidiary viper own mineral interests underlying approximately 24528 gross 15948 net acres primarily in midland county texas in the permian basin approximately 43 of these net acres are operated by us since our initial acquisition in the permian basin through december 31 2014  we drilled or participated in the drilling of 405 gross 343 net wells on our leasehold acreage in this area primarily targeting the wolfberry play the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely 

through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play as of december 31 2014  we held interests in 747 gross 597 net producing wells 

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid mississippianpennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the ouachita fold belt it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations in this report we refer to the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp strawn and atoka formations collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play of the midland basin lies in the area where the historically productive spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of the emerging wolfcamp play 

the spraberry was deposited as turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberry and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the shales themselves and in the more conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs between the shales the wolfberry is an unconventional “basincentered oil” resource play in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

  

  over the course of the past few years the improved economics derived from horizontal drilling has caused us to shift our focus primarily to this technology we have successfully developed several shale intervals within the clearfork spraberry and wolfcamp formations since we began horizontal drilling in 2012 the shales exhibit microdarcy permeabilities which result in relatively small drainage areas and recovery factors so relatively small interwell spacing is necessary 

we possess or are in the process of acquiring 3d seismic data over substantially all of our major asset areas our extensive geophysical database currently includes approximately 628 square miles of 3d data and we are in the process of acquiring an additional 625 square miles this data will continue to be utilized in the development of our horizontal drilling activities and to identify and avoid potential geohazards eg faults and lithologies that are difficult to drill

during the year ended december 31 2014  net production from our permian basin acreage was 7107886  boe or an average of 19474  boed of which approximately 76  was oil 14  was natural gas liquids and 10  was natural gas 

facilities 

our land oil and gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilgaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

  

future activity 

during 2015 we expect to drill an estimated 50 to 60 gross 43 to 51 net horizontal wells and five to ten gross four to eight net vertical wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be between 4000 million and 4500 million which includes costs for infrastructure and nonoperated wells but does not include the cost of any land acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014  we drilled 82 gross 67 net horizontal wells and 27 gross 23 net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross two net nonoperated wells in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2014  our aggregate capital 

expenditures for drilling and oil gas infrastructure were 4983 million  and we spent an additional 9035 million  for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

sec rulemaking activity 

in december 2008 the securities and exchange commission or sec released its final rule for “modernization of oil and gas reporting” these rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area using the arithmetic 12month average beginningofthemonth price for the year as opposed to yearend prices as had previously been required unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used other significant amendments included the following 

 we adopted the rules effective december 31 2009 as required by the sec 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets and those of viper ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2014  were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 90 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline 

curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 10 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve reports to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our vice president—reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our vice president—reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 26 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

   

 the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  including those attributable to viper based on the reserve reports prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 





the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“ risk factors ” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2014  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 31804  mbbls of oil 43341  mmcf of natural gas and 7321  mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 46348  mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production the following table includes the changes in pud reserves for 2014  



the increase in proved undeveloped reserves was primarily attributable to extensions of 29907 mboe approximately 16 of the proved undeveloped reserve extensions are associated with well locations that are more than one offset away from existing producing wells all of these locations are within 2000 feet of producing wells partially offsetting the increase in proved undeveloped reserves were decreases due to technical revisions downward revisions of approximately 6162 mboe were a result of downgrading 73 vertical locations due to a shift in our focus to horizontal development rather than vertical development 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 861 million during 2014 estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 2197 million in 2015 2292 million in 2016 942 million in 2017 and 395 million in 2018 since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

as of december 31 2014 all of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded 

as of december 31 2014  15 of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and natural gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 



1 after giving effect to our derivative instruments the average prices per bbl of oil and per boe were 8542 and 7121 respectively during the year ended december 31 2014 8975 and 7514 respectively during the year ended december 31 2013 and 7968 and 6447 respectively during the year ended december 31 2012 

productive wells 

as of december 31 2014 we owned an average 80 working interest in 747 gross 596 net productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2014 relating to our leasehold acreage 

  





undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2014 that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 

  



1 in february 2015 leases for 19779 gross 7689 net acres in crockett county expired 

drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



as of december 31 2014 we had 40 gross 33 net wells in the process of drilling completing or dewatering or shut in awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table 

title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we typically sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company  64  and enterprise crude oil llc  16  for the year ended december 31 2013 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 37 and shell trading us company 37 for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed however based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers 

on may 24 2012 we entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company shell trading in which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to shell trading upon completion of the reversal of the magellan longhorn pipeline and its conversion for oil shipment which occurred on october 1 2013 our agreement with shell trading has an initial term of five years from the completion date the agreement may also be terminated by shell trading by written notice to us in the event that shell trading’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to elect to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity which decreased contract quantity will be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement shell trading has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the new york mercantile exchange over the one 

month period as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in the agreement if we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement during any threemonth period following the service commencement date we have agreed to pay shell trading a deficiency payment which is calculated by multiplying i the volume of oil that we failed to deliver as required under the agreement during such period by ii magellan’s longhorn spot tariff rate in effect for transportation from crane texas to the houston ship channel for the period of time for which such deficiency volume is calculated 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we evaluate all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems the oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm where it is further transported by pipeline our natural gas is generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through our gathering system 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed construction of a gas gathering system that transports our gas stream to a sour gas pipeline thereby eliminating the processing and treating expense in 2014 we moved approximately 71 of our produced water by pipeline directly into commercial salt water disposal wells rather than by truck thereby further reducing one of the largest components of lease operating expense or loe in the second quarter of 2014 we completed construction of an oil gathering pipeline which reduces the costs associated with hauling the oil to be sold by truck by approximately 200 per barrel we believe that the completion of gathering systems the connection to salt water disposal wells and other actions will help us to reduce our lease operating expense in future periods 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1875 to 2500 resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 8125 to 7500 

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the us environmental protection agency or the epa issue regulations which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically sensitive and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities the strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling  the resource conservation and recovery act as amended or rcra and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions however we cannot assure you that the epa or state or local governments will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended also known as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally imposes strict and joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater 

contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released 

water discharges  the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act or opa and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak these laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on october 20 2011 the epa announced a schedule to develop pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from underground coalbed and shale formations the epa stated that it will gather data consult with stakeholders including ongoing consultation with industry and solicit public comment on a proposed rule for shale gas in early 2015 costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 

noncompliance with the clean water act or opa may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions  the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “regulation of hydraulic fracturing” these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 

climate change in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases or ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary 

sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities in response to its endangerment finding the epa adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of ghg emissions under the clean air act the motor vehicle rule which became effective in january 2011 purports to limit emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles the epa adopted the stationary source rule which we refer to as the tailoring rule in may 2010 and it also became effective january 2011 the tailoring rule established new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration or psd and title v programs of the clean air act on june 23 2014 in utility air regulatory group v epa  which we refer to as uarg v epa  the supreme court held that stationary sources could not become subject to psd or title v permitting solely by reason of their ghg emissions the court ruled however that the epa may require installation of best available control technology for ghg emissions at sources otherwise subject to the psd and title v programs on december 19 2014 the epa issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on ghg permitting requirements in response to the court’s decision in uarg v epa  in its preliminary guidance the epa indicates it will undertake a rulemaking action no later than december 31 2015 to rescind any psd permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the court in the interim the epa issued a narrowly crafted “no action assurance” indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to ghgs in an epaissued psd permit and for related terms and conditions in a title v permit additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gasdistribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 

the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations applicable to other industries such as the september 2013 proposed ghg rule that if finalized would set new source performance standards for new coalfired and naturalgas fired power plants which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result of this continued regulatory focus future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production the federal safe drinking water act or sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control or uic program hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the uic program and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions the epa however has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program specifically as “class ii” uic wells in addition on may 9 2014 the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing the public comment period ended on september 18 2014 also the epa is updating chloride water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life under the clean water act which criteria are used by states for 

establishing acceptable discharge limits the epa is expected to release draft criteria in early 2016 moreover the epa announced in october 2011 that it was launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards in early 2015 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant as part of these studies the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process these studies depending on their results could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 

legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress 

on august 16 2012 the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards or the nsp standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds or vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january 1 2015 the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed the epa intends to issue revised rules that are likely responsive to some of these requests for example on april 12 2013 the epa published a proposed amendment extending compliance dates for certain storage vessels also on december 19 2014 the epa released final updates and clarifications to the nsp standards in addition on january 14 2015 the epa announced a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smogforming voc emissions from the oil and gas industry at this point we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty in addition the us department of the interior or the doi published a revised proposed rule on may 24 2013 that would update existing regulation for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands including requirements for disclosure well bore integrity and handling of flowback water the doi announced its intent to finalize the rule in 2014 however the final rule remains pending 

in addition there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources with results of the study anticipated to be available march 2015 the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administrationwide review of hydraulic fracturing practices the us department of energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulicfracturing completion methods additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the sec to investigate the naturalgas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 

several states including texas and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process effective as of september 1 2011 the texas railroad commission or rrc has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the rrc issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the new law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the rrc with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the rrc additionally on october 28 2014 the rrc adopted disposal well rule amendments designed among other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback 

fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments also clarify the rrc’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the disposal well rule amendments became effective november 17 2014 also in may 2013 the rrc adopted new rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the new rules took effect in january 2014 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal state or local level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production 

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 

 state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate the us army corps of engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment decommissioning and site restoration although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 

natural gas sales and transportation  historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or at marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations 

oil sales and transportation  sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future 

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and 

scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation  texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see “item 1a risk factors—risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 114 full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland and in oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 

availability of company reports 

our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge on the investor relations page of our website at wwwdiamondbackenergycom as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in “item 1 business” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial conditional or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2014 our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 14034 million  our 2015 capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 4000 million to 4500 million representing a decrease of 6 over our 2014 capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2015 could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

• recoverable reserves 

• future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials 

• operating costs and 

• potential environmental and other liabilities 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 

our analysis of the acreage subject to our september 2014 acquisition and our martin county acquisitions completed in february 2014 was based in part on information provided to us by the sellers and the limited representations warranties and indemnifications of the sellers contained in the purchase agreements which may prove to be incorrect resulting in our not realizing the expected benefits of the acquisition 

our analysis of the acreage subject to our september 2014 acquisition and our martin county acquisitions completed in february 2014 including our estimates of the associated proved reserves was based in part on information provided to us by the sellers including historical production data our independent reserve engineers have not reviewed nor have they provided any estimates with respect to the assets subject to the pending acquisition as a result the assumptions on which our internal estimates of proved reserves and horizontal drilling locations included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways resulting in our not realizing our expected benefits of the acquisition in addition the representations warranties and indemnities of the sellers contained in the purchase agreements are limited and we may not have recourse against the sellers in the event that the acreage does not perform as expected 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history from inception through december 31 2014 we drilled a total of 109 gross wells and participated in an additional four gross nonoperated wells of which 74 wells were completed as producing wells and 39 wells were in various stages of completion if the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

as of december 31 2014 we had 2185 gross 1646 net identified potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as well as 786 gross 746 net identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40acre spacing and an additional 1084 gross 996 net identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20acre downspacing as of december 31 2014 only 79 of our gross identified potential vertical drilling locations and 87 of our identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified 1262 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable or whether wells drilled on 20acre downspacing will produce at the same rates as those on 40acre spacing the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business while through december 31 2014 we are the operator of or have participated in a total of 100 horizontal wells completed on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2014 we had leases representing 14999  net acres expiring in 2015 of which 7689 net acres did expire in february 2015 14959  net acres expiring in 2016 2567  net acres expiring in 2017 no  net acres expiring 

in 2018 and 21  net acres expiring in 2019 the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2015 and 2016 we will need to operate at least a onerig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

market conditions for oil and natural gas and particularly the recent decline in prices for oil and natural gas could adversely affect our revenue cash flows profitability growth production and the present value of our estimated reserves 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including 

 these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty during the past six years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of 3403 per barrel or bbl in february 2009 to a high of 11339 per bbl in april 2011 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of 182 per mmbtu in april 2012 to a high of 751 per mmbtu in january 2010 during 2014 wti prices ranged from 5327 to 10691 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 289 to 615 per mmbtu on january 20 2015 the wti posted price for crude oil was 4896 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 313 per mmbtu representing decreases of 54 and 49 respectively from the high of 10691 per bbl of oil and 615 per mmbtu for natural gas during 2014 if the prices of oil and natural gas continue at current levels or decline further our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward 

adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities 

we have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional price swap derivatives for a portion of our production although we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2015 production we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate pricing argus louisiana light sweet pricing or intercontinental exchange or ice pricing for brent crude oil the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty these contracts and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 

as of december 31 2014 we had crude oil swap contracts in place covering nymex west texas intermediate crude oil priced at a weighted average price of 8410  for 1825000  aggregate bbls for the production period january through december 2015 in addition as of december 31 2014 we had crude oil swap contracts in place covering argus louisiana light sweet crude oil priced at a weighted average price of 9302  for 1426000  aggregate bbls for the production period of january through december 2015 in addition as of december 31 2014 we also have crude oil swap contracts in place covering ice brent crude oil priced at a weighted average price of 8878  for 640000  aggregate bbls for the production period of february through december 2015 and a price of 8872  for 91000  aggregate bbls for the production period of january through february 2016 currently approximately 10700 bbl per day of our estimated 2015 production are hedged with a combination of brent wti and lls fixed price swaps at an average price of 8814 per bbl we have not entered into any significant hedging transactions with respect to our anticipated 2016 production to the extent that the price of oil remains at current levels or declines further we will not be able to hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 509 million  at december 31 2014 and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 471 million  at december 31 2014 joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2014 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company  64  and enterprise crude oil llc  16  for the year ended december 31 2013 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 37 and shell trading us company 37 for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 2379  2463  and 2390  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  was 1687 million  658 million  and 258 million  respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we may however experience ceiling test write downs in the future see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties ” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 which include those attributable to viper are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in accordance with the sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities—oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

approximately 411 of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31 2014 were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves 

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 

all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of december 31 2014 all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play this concentration of assets within a small 

number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field 

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2014 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company  64  and enterprise crude oil llc  16  for the year ended december 31 2013 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 37 and shell trading us company 37 for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations during the last two years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

concerns over general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european debt crisis and the united states financial market have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the global economy these factors combined with volatility in commodity prices business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates have precipitated an economic slowdown concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish which 

could impact the price at which we can sell our production affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history 

diamondback energy inc was incorporated in delaware on december 30 2011 prior to october 11 2012 all of our historical oil and natural gas assets operations and results described in this report were those of windsor permian llc or windsor permian and windsor ut llc or windsor ut which prior to our initial public offering were entities controlled by our equity sponsor wexford capital lp or wexford immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering windsor permian became our whollyowned subsidiary and we acquired the oil and natural gas assets of gulfport energy corporation or gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for shares of our common stock and a promissory note in a transaction we refer to as the gulfport transaction the oil and natural gas properties described in this report have been acquired by windsor permian gulfport and windsor ut since december 2007 as a result there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as a recentlyformed company growth in accordance with our business plan if achieved could place a significant strain on our financial technical operational and management resources as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

we incurred a net loss of 365 million for the year ended december 31 2012 our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results 

are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue see item 1 “ business—regulation ” for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production the federal safe drinking water act or sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control or uic program hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the uic program and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions the environmental protection agency or epa however has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program specifically as “class ii” uic wells in addition on may 9 2014 the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing the public comment period ended on september 18 2014 also the epa is updating chloride water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life under the clean water act which criteria are used by states for establishing acceptable discharge limits the epa is expected to release draft criteria in early 2016 moreover the epa announced on october 20 2011 that it is launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards in early 2015 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant hydraulic fracturing stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water with some resulting “flowback” as well as “produced water” if adopted the new pretreatment rules will require operators to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to a treatment facility that discharges to surface water as part of these studies the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process these studies depending on their results could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 

legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds or vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january 1 2015 the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed the epa intends to issue revised rules that are likely responsive to some of these requests for example on september 23 2013 the epa published an amendment extending compliance dates for certain storage vessels also on december 19 2014 the epa released final updates and clarifications to the nsp standards in addition on january 14 2015 the epa announced a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smogforming voc emissions from the oil and gas industry at this point we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty in addition the us department of the interior published a revised proposed rule on may 24 2013 that would update existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands including requirements for disclosure well bore integrity and handling of flowback water the doi announced its intent to finalize the rule in 2014 however the final rule remains pending 

these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities the epa is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources with results of the study anticipated to be available march 2015 the white house council on environmental quality is conducting an administrationwide review of hydraulic fracturing practices the us department of energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulicfracturing completion methods additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 

several states including texas and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances impose more stringent operating standards andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the rrc adopted rules and regulations requiring that well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal occupational safety and health act or osha to state regulators and on a public internet website additionally on october 28 2014 the rrc adopted disposal well rule amendments designed amongst other things to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive nonhazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the us geological survey the searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well the disposal well rule amendments also clarify the rrc’s authority to modify suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity the disposal well rule amendments became effective november 17 2014 also in may 2013 the rrc adopted new rules governing well casing cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources the new rules took effect in january 2014 we use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal state or local level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws moreover public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years the trend of more expansive and stringent 

environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act hr 4173 or doddfrank act which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission or cftc has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the cftc’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the cftc to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the cftc has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the cftc will finalize certain other related rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in 

part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed as a result of future legislation 

from time to time legislative proposals are made that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws these proposed changes have included but are not limited to i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development iii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and v implementing certain international tax reforms 

these proposed changes in the us tax law if adopted or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities in response to its endangerment finding the epa adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of ghg emissions under the clean air act the motor vehicle rule which became effective in january 2011 purports to limit emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles the epa adopted the stationary source rule also known as the tailoring rule in may 2010 and it also became effective january 2011 the tailoring rule established new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the psd and title v programs of the clean air act on june 23 2014 in uarg v epa  the supreme court held that stationary sources could not become subject to psd or title v permitting solely by reason of their ghg emissions the court ruled however that the epa may require installation of best available control technology for ghg emissions at sources otherwise subject to the psd and title v programs on december 19 2014 the epa issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on ghg permitting requirements in response to the court’s decision in uarg v epa  in its preliminary guidance the epa indicates it will undertake a rulemaking action no later than december 31 2015 to rescind any psd permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the court in the interim the epa issued a narrowly crafted “no action assurance” indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to ghgs in an epaissued psd permit and for related terms and conditions in a title v permit additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gasdistribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 

in addition in august 2012 the epa established new source performance standards for volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide and an air toxic standard for oil and natural gas production transmission and storage the rules include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured or refractured as well as requirements for several other sources such as storage tanks and other equipment and limits methane emissions from these sources in an effort to reduce ghg emissions 

the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries such as the september 2013 proposed ghg rule that if finalized would set new source performance standards for new coalfired and naturalgas fired power plants which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result of this continued regulatory focus future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas 

cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry and state and local climate change initiatives and at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 or the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore is exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the nga however the distinction between ferc—regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the 

retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

a significant reduction by wexford of its ownership interest in us could adversely affect us 

prior to october 11 2012 wexford beneficially owned 100 of our equity interests upon completion of our initial public offering wexford beneficially owned approximately 444 of our common stock as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock by us and sales of our common stock by affiliates of wexford as of february 3 2015 wexford beneficially owned approximately 51 of our common stock further the chairman of our board of directors is an affiliate of wexford we believe that wexford’s continuing ownership interest in us provides wexford with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful wexford is not subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time thereafter to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its remaining ownership interest in us if wexford sells all or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us wexford may have less incentive to assist in our success and its affiliates that serve as members of our board of directors may resign such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies which could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations we also receive certain services including drilling services from entities controlled by wexford these service contracts may generally be terminated on 30 days notice in the event wexford further reduces its ownership or ceases to own an equity interest in us such services may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected 

as of december 31 2013 we were required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or sarbanesoxley act section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls during the course of our integration of our internal controls over financial reporting we may identify areas requiring improvement and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results 

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2014 2013 and 2012 and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we incurred 143 million  40 million  and 63 million  respectively of stock based compensation expense of which we capitalized 44 million  10 million  and 25 million  respectively pursuant to the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness 

as of december 31 2014 we had total longterm debt of 6735 million  including 4500 million outstanding under the senior notes and we had unused borrowing base availability of 2765 million  under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2014 viper one of our subsidiaries had no borrowings and 1100 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 

 a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility the indenture governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering on june 23 2014 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which modified certain provisions of our revolving credit facility to allow us among other things to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not 

subject to certain restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility under the amended revolving credit facility we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation they were automatically released from any and all obligations under the amended revolving credit facility including the related guaranty and all liens on the assets of and the equity interests in viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary under the amended revolving credit facility were automatically released further in connection with the closing of viper’s initial public offering we designated viper the general partner and viper’s subsidiary as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the senior notes and upon such designation viper energy partners llc which was a guarantor under the indenture governing the senior notes prior to such designation was released as a guarantor under the indenture governing the senior notes 

we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility if default occurs the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 

availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of 7500 million  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  the borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors as of december 31 2014 we had outstanding borrowings of 2235 million  which bore a weighted average interest rate of 167 we intend to continue borrowing under our revolving credit facility in the future any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow further if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination we would be required to repay the excess we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing we may have to sell significant assets any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices 

that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2014 our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at 7500 million  of which we have elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  and we had outstanding borrowings of 2235 million  under this facility as of december 31 2014 viper had no borrowings and 1100 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility in addition the indenture governing the senior notes allows us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors the indenture governing the senior notes also allows us to incur certain other additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indenture governing the senior notes does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

borrowings under our and vipers revolving credit facilities expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 05 to 150 in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150 to 250 in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2014 we had 2235 million  in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility our weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings from our revolving credit facility was 167 during the year ended december 31 2014  viper’s weighted average interest rate on borrowings from its revolving credit facility was 045 during the year ended december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014 viper one of our subsidiaries had no borrowings and 1100 million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facility if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

one of our stockholders continues to own a significant percentage of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders 

as of february 3 2015 wexford beneficially owned approximately 51 of our common stock in addition an individual affiliated with wexford serves as the chairman of our board of directors as a result wexford may be able to exercise influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions the interests of wexford with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us such as future acquisitions financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable wexford our equity sponsor or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 

 these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies these transactions include among others drilling services provided to us by bison drilling and field services llc or bison real property leased by us from fasken midland llc hydraulic fracturing sand purchased by us from muskie proppant llc or muskie and gas purchased from us by coronado midstream llc under the gas purchase agreement with us each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with wexford and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts for a discussion of potential conflicts see “ —risks related to our common stock—one of our stockholders continues to own a significant percentage of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders ” 

we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company which may significantly affect our financial condition 

we completed our initial public offering in october 2012 as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules implemented by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 

since the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeded 700 million as of june 30 2013 we ceased to be an “emerging growth company” as of december 31 2013 and as a result expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act see “—risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected ” 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more 

volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such future sales may occur may cause our stock price to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock except for any shares purchased by our affiliates all of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent equity offering are freely tradable in connection with our initial public offering we also granted db energy holdings llc or db holdings and gulfport and their respective affiliates certain registration rights obligating us to register with the sec their shares of our common stock in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the market perceives that such sales may occur the price of our stock could decline 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders 

we have not paid dividends since our inception and we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition results of operations contractual restrictions capital requirements business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions as a result only appreciation of the price of our common stock which may not occur will provide a return to our stockholders

basis of presentation 

transfers of a business between entities under common control are accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period and prior years are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information as discussed in note 1 to our combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report the windsor ut contribution was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control accordingly the financial information and production data contained in this report have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of windsor ut at historical carrying values and its operations prior to october 11 2012 the effective date of the windsor ut contribution 

operating results overview 

during the year ended december 31 2014  our average daily production was approximately 19474  boed consisting of 14744  bblsd of oil 11907  mcfd of natural gas and 2745  bblsd of natural gas liquids an increase of 12153  boed or 166  from average daily production of 7321  boed for the year ended december 31 2013  consisting of 5542  bblsd of oil 4741  mcfd of natural gas and 989  bblsd of natural gas liquids 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we drilled 82 gross 67 net horizontal wells and 27 gross 22 net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross two net nonoperated wells in the permian basin additionally on properties acquired this year there were 10 gross 8 net wells drilled during the year ended december 31 2014  by the original operator between the effective date and closing date on the property acquired 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives for the year ended december 31 2014  our revenues were derived 91 from oil sales 6 from natural gas liquids sales and 3 from natural gas sales for the year ended december 31 2013 our revenues were derived 91 from oil sales 6 from natural gas liquids sales and 3 from natural gas sales for the year ended december 31 2012 our revenues were derived 88 from oil sales 9 from natural gas liquids sales and 3 from natural gas sales our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold production mix or commodity prices 

since our production consists primarily of oil our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2014 west texas intermediate posted prices ranged from 5345 to 10795 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 274 to 815 per mmbtu on december 31 2014 the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was 5345 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 314 per mmbtu 

the industry has recently observed a decline in oil prices from over 10500 per bbl in june 2014 to below 5000 per bbl in february 2015 combined with increasing service costs while we entered 2015 running five horizontal rigs and one vertical rig we intend to release two horizontal rigs and the one vertical rig in february 2015 and continue with three horizontal rigs two of which will operate in spanish trail our decision to reduce our rig count rather than increase it as previously contemplated is based on our goal of maximizing return on capital and minimizing debt until we can get a more attractive return on our assets 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment expense  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income  this represents the interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense  we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions we reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense in addition we include the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense 

gainloss on derivative instruments  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of the change in the fair value of open nonhedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

loss from equity investment  this line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our investment in the membership interests of muskie an equity method investment 

income tax expense  prior to our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes at the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 





comparison of the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 2877 million  or 138  to 4957 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 2080 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 12153  boed to 19474  boed during the year ended december 31 2014  from 7321  boed during the year ended december 31 2013  the total increase in revenue of approximately 2877 million  is largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  partially offset by lower average sales prices the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions our production increased by 3358827  bbls of oil 640912  bbls of natural gas liquids and 2615419  mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 582 million  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 3460 million  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 





lease operating expense  lease operating expense or loe was 554 million   779  per boe for the year ended december 31 2014  an increase of 342 million  or 162  from 212 million   792  per boe for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase is due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions which resulted in 389 additional producing wells for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells on a per boe basis loe remained stable as new volumes came on line and expenses were held in line or were reduced 

production and ad valorem tax expense  production and ad valorem taxes increased to 326 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  from 129 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during the year ended december 31 2014  our production taxes per boe decreased by 024  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization or dda expense increased 1034 million  or 155  from 666 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  to 1700 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  

the following table provides components of our dda expense for the periods presented 



the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 1029 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  resulted primarily from higher total production levels increased net book value on new reserves added and an increase in capitalized interest to the full cost pool on a per boe basis dda decreased primarily due to the increased net book value on new reserves and acquisitions 

general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense increased 102 million  from 110 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  to 213 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the increase was due to increases in stock based compensation salary legal professional service and advisory service expenses these increases were partially offset by increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014  was 345 million  as compared to 81 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  an increase of 265 million  this increase was due primarily to the issuance of 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7625 senior notes in september 2013 

derivatives  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of 104 million  and a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of 72 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  we had a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of 1171 million  and 53 million  respectively

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 1330 million  or 177  to 2080 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  from 750 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 4375  boed to 7321  boed during the year ended december 31 2013  from 2946  boed during the year ended december 31 2012 the total increase in revenue of approximately 1330 million  was largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and the effect for the full year in 2013 of the contribution of gulfport’s permian basin assets on october 11 2012 in connection with our initial public offering our production increased by 1266463  bbls of oil 177965  bbls of natural gas liquids and 896981  mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the net dollar effect of the increases in prices of approximately 138 million  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 1193 million  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 





lease operating expense  lease operating expense or loe was 212 million   792  per boe for the year ended december 31 2013  an increase of 59 million  or 39  from 152 million   1414  per boe for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions which resulted in 126 gross 105 net additional producing wells at december 31 2013 as compared to december 31 2012 on a per boe basis loe declined successively for each quarter throughout 2013 as new volumes came on line and expenses were held in line or were reduced by the end of 2013 we were moving approximately 70 of our produced water by pipeline directly into commercial salt water disposal wells rather than by truck thereby further reducing one of our largest components of loe 

production and ad valorem tax expense  production and ad valorem taxes increased to 129 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  from 52 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during 2013 our production taxes per boe increased by 2 as compared to 2012 primarily reflecting the impact of higher oil and natural gas prices on production taxes our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties and an increase in the number of wells included in those valuations as a result of our 2013 drilling activity 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization or dda expense increased 403 million  or 153  from 263 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 to 666 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  

the following table provides components of our dda expense for the periods presented 



the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 400 million and 073 per boe for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 resulted primarily from higher total production levels increased net book value on new reserves added and an increase in capitalized interest to the full cost pool 

general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense increased 07 million  from 104 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 to 110 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase was due to increases in salary legal and compliance services professional service and advisory service expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  was 81 million  as compared to 36 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of 45 million  or 123  this increase was due primarily to the interest expense associated with the issuance of 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7625 senior notes in september 2013 

derivatives  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of 72 million  and 54 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of 53 million  and 81 million  respectively 

income tax expense prior to our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes as of october 11 2012 the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 541 million for the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a deferred income tax expense of 549 million income tax 

expense of 08 million was incurred as a result of operations from october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 for the year ended december 31 2013 our provision for income taxes was 318 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3564 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 1558 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 1660  increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 104  decrease in our net realized sales prices 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1558 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 497 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in operating cash flows is primarily a result of the increases in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 1478  increase in our net boe production and a 120  increase in our net realized sales prices 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict see “—sources of our revenue” above 

investing activities 

the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities we used cash for investing activities of 14820 million  9401 million  and 1831 million during the years ended december 31 2014 2013  and 2012 respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we spent 4998 million  on capital expenditures in conjunction with our infrastructure projects and drilling program in which we drilled 82 gross 67 net horizontal wells and 27 gross 22 net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross two net nonoperated wells we spent an additional 8458 million  on leasehold costs 442 million  for the purchase of other property and equipment approximately 577 million  on acquisitions of mineral interests underlying approximately 10364  gross  3261  net acres in the midland and delaware basins and approximately 339 million  for a minor equity interest in an entity that owns mineral overriding royalty net profits leasehold and other similar interests 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we spent 2977 million  on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we drilled 77 gross 70 net wells and participated in the drilling of an additional four gross two net nonoperated wells we spent an additional 4441 million  on the acquisition of mineral interests 1773 million  on leasehold costs 22 million  for the purchase of other property and equipment 03 million  net on the settlement of nonhedge derivative instruments and 186 million for the postclosing adjustment associated with our acquisition of gulfport energy corporation’s oil and natural gas assets in the permian basin in connection with our initial public offering in october 2012 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we spent 1001 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 65 gross 44 net wells we spent an additional 117 million on the acquisition of leasehold interests 11 million for the purchase of other property and equipment and 66 million net on the settlement of derivative transactions on october 11 2012 we acquired all of the oil and natural gas properties of gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for i 7914036 shares of our common stock ii 636 million in the form of a noninterest bearing promissory note that was repaid in full upon the closing of our initial public offering and iii a postclosing cash adjustment of approximately 186 million 

our investing activities for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  are summarized in the following table 



financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 11402 million   7736 million  and 1528 million  respectively the 2014 amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of 2084 million  from our february 2014 equity offering net proceeds of 1372 million  from the viper offering net proceeds of 4850 million from our july 2014 equity offering net proceeds of 948 million from the viper september 2014 equity offering and borrowings net of repayment of 2135 million under our credit facility during the year ended december 31 2013  the amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a the net proceeds of 1444 million from our may 2013 equity offering 1775 million from our august 2013 equity offering 4500 million from our september 2013 senior note offering and b net borrowings of 100 million under our revolving credit facility in both 2014 and 2013 these proceeds were used primarily to acquire property and fund our drilling costs 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we borrowed 150 million under our revolving credit facility and 300 million under our subordinated note with wexford and received capital contributions from our members of 40 million 

on october 17 2012 our initial public offering was completed and we received net proceeds of approximately 2341 million after deducting the underwriting discount during 2012 we borrowed 150 million under our revolving credit facility all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were repaid with proceeds of the initial public offering during 2012 we borrowed 300 million under our subordinated note with wexford this note was repaid with proceeds of the initial public offering and was canceled during 2012 we received capital contributions from our members of 40 million these proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and purchase property during the year ended december 31 2012 we paid 29 million for costs associated with our initial public offering 

senior notes 

on september 18 2013 we completed an offering of 4500 million  in aggregate principal amount of 7625  senior unsecured notes due 2021 which we refer to as the senior notes the senior notes bear interest at the rate of 7625  per annum payable semiannually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year commencing on april 1 2014 and will mature on october 1 2021 on june 23 2014 in connection with the viper offering we designated viper the general partner and viper energy partners llc as unrestricted subsidiaries and upon such designation viper energy partners llc which was a guarantor under the indenture governing of the senior notes was released as a guarantor under the indenture as of december 31 2014  the senior notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by diamondback og llc diamondback ep llc and white fang energy llc and will also be guaranteed by any of our future restricted subsidiaries the net proceeds from the senior notes were used to fund the acquisition of mineral interests underlying approximately 14804  gross  12687  net acres in midland county texas in the permian basin 

the senior notes were issued under and are governed by an indenture among us the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and wells fargo bank na as the trustee as amended and supplemented or the indenture we may issue additional senior notes under the indenture and all senior notes issued under the indenture will constitute part of a single class of securities for all purposes of the indenture the indenture contains certain covenants that subject to certain exceptions and qualifications among other things limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness make certain investments declare or pay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock prepay subordinated indebtedness sell assets including capital stock of subsidiaries agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens engage in business other than the oil and gas business and designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries if we experience certain kinds of changes of control or if we sell certain of our assets holders of the senior notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their senior notes

second amended and restated credit facility 

our second amended and restated credit agreement dated november 1 2013 as amended on june 9 2014 and november 13 2014 with a syndication of banks including wells fargo as administrative agent sole book runner and lead arranger provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of 20 billion  subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors the “borrowing base” the borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined semiannually with effective dates of may 1st and november 1st in addition we may request up to three  additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12 month period as of december 31 2014  the borrowing base was set at 7500 million  although we elected a commitment amount of 5000 million  as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding borrowings of 2235 million  which bore a weightedaverage interest rate of 167 and 2765 million  available for future borrowings under this facility 

the june 9 2014 amendment modified certain provisions of the credit agreement to among other things allow us to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as “unrestricted subsidiaries” that are not subject to certain 

restrictions contained in the credit agreement in connection with the viper offering we designated viper the general partner and viper energy partners llc as unrestricted subsidiaries under the credit agreement as of december 31 2014  the loan is guaranteed by us diamondback ep llc and white fang energy llc and will also be guaranteed by any future restricted subsidiaries of diamondback the credit agreement is also secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of diamondback og llc and the guarantors 

  

the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by us that is equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 050 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 050 to 150 in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150 to 250 in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0375 to 050 per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage and is required to be repaid a to the extent the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise in some cases subject to a cure period b in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and c at the maturity date of november 1 2018 

the credit agreement contains various affirmative negative and financial maintenance covenants these covenants among other things limit additional indebtedness additional liens sales of assets mergers and consolidations dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below

as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default the credit agreement contains customary events of default including nonpayment breach of covenants materially incorrect representations crossdefault bankruptcy and change of control with certain specified exceptions the terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility generally may be amended with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments to lend 

partnership credit facilitywells fargo bank 

on july 8 2014 viper entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association or wells fargo as the administrative agent sole book runner and lead arranger the credit agreement which was amended august 15 2014 to add additional lenders to the lending group provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of 5000 million  subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on vipers oil and natural gas reserves and other factors the “borrowing base” the borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined semiannually with effective dates of april 1st and october 1st in addition viper may request up to three  additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12 month period as of december 31 2014  the borrowing base was set at 1100 million  and viper had no  outstanding borrowings

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

our board of directors approved a 2015 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of 4000 million to 4500 million representing a decrease of 6 over our 2014 capital budget we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 during the year ended december 31 2014  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were 4998 million  we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted during the year ended december 31 2014  we spent approximately 8458 million  on acquisitions of leasehold interests 

the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners 

based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2015 we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2015 however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully 

develop our properties further our 2015 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013 





critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 2 of the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our combined consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the combined consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities stockbased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser net of royalty interests discounts and allowances as applicable we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves no 

receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided 

impairment 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization impairment and deferred income taxes exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves less any related income tax effects the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense in calculating future net revenues prices are calculated as the average oil and gas prices during the preceding 12month period prior to the end of the current reporting period determined as the unweighted arithmetic average firstdayofthemonth prices for the prior 12month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change

we grant various types of stockbased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 10—stock and unit based compensation stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 “ revenue from contracts with customers ” asu 201409 supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and requires i an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services and ii requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers the standard will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early application not permitted the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2014  please read note 15 included in notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10–k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on argus louisiana light sweet pricing 

at december 31 2014  we had a net asset derivative position of 1175 million  related to our price swap derivatives as compared to a net asset derivative position of 04 million as of december 31 2013 related to our price swap derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps as of december 31 2014  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position to 942 million a decrease of 234 million while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position to 1409 million an increase of 234 million however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 509 million  at december 31 2014  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 471 million  at december 31 2014  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2014  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue shell trading us company  64  and enterprise crude oil llc  16  for the year ended december 31 2013 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 37 and shell trading us company 37 for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2014  we had two customers that represented approximately 61 of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2013 we had one customer that represented approximately 86 of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an alternative base rate which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate the federal funds effective rate plus 05 and 3month libor plus 10 or libor in each case plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 05 to 150 in the case of the alternative base rate and from 150 to 250 in the case of libor in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base our weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was 167 at december 31 2014 an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our interest expense of approximately 22 million based on the 2235 million  outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility on december 31 2014

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174 net acres with production at the time of acquisition of approximately 800 boed from 34 gross 168 net wells in the permian basin subsequently we acquired approximately 61764  additional net acres which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to 65938  net acres at december 31 2013  we are the operator of approximately 99 of this acreage in addition we own mineral interests underlying approximately 15000 gross 12500 net acres in midland county texas and we are the operator of approximately 50 of the acreage associated with these mineral interests as of december 31 2013  we had drilled 270 gross 243 net wells and participated in an additional 22 gross nine net nonoperated wells in the permian basin of these 292 gross 252 net wells 277 were completed as producing wells and 15 were in various stages of completion in 2013 we acquired working interests in 49 gross 40 net producing wells in the aggregate as of december 31 2013  we held interests in 351 gross 306 net producing wells in the permian basin nine gross eight net wells have been plugged and abandoned or converted to service wells we also hold royalty interests in 81 wells in which we have no working interest as discussed in more detail below under “–pending acquisition” we recently entered into agreements to acquire approximately 6450 gross 2825 net leasehold acres in martin county texas 

our activities are primarily focused on the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations which we refer to collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates the wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the spraberry play the majority of which is designated in the spraberry trend area field according to the us energy information administration the spraberry trend area ranked as the second largest oilfield in the united states based on 2009 reserves 

as of december 31 2013  our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 63586  mboe based on a reserve report prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 45 are classified as proved developed producing or pdp proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 206 vertical gross 151 net well locations on 40acre spacing and 43 gross 31 net horizontal well locations as of december 31 2013  these proved reserves were approximately 67 oil 17 natural gas liquids and 16 natural gas 

based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data as of december 31 2013  we had 848 identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40acre spacing an additional 1128 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20acre downspacing and we had also identified 1430 potential horizontal drilling 

locations in multiple horizons on our acreage we intend to continue to grow our reserves and production through development drilling exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through additional acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves the gross estimated ultimate recoveries or eurs from our future pud vertical wells on 40acre spacing as estimated by ryder scott as of december 31 2013  range from 109 mboe per well consisting of 83 mbbls of oil and 156 mmcf of natural gas to 150 mboe per well consisting of 114 mbbls of oil and 214 mmcf of natural gas with an average eur per well of 128 mboe consisting of 94 mbbls of oil and 204 mmcf of natural gas we also intend to continue to refine our drilling pattern and completion techniques in an effort to increase our average eur per well from vertical wells drilled on 40acre spacing we currently anticipate a reduction of approximately 20 in our eurs from vertical wells drilled on 20acre spacing 

  

horizontal wells  in 2012 we began testing the horizontal well potential of our acreage our first horizontal well was the janey 16h in upton county and was drilled in the wolfcamp b interval we are the operator of this well with a 100 working interest our second horizontal well was the kemmer 4209h well in midland county also drilled in the wolfcamp b interval it is a nonoperated well in which we own a 47 working interest since the initial two wells through december 31 2013 we have drilled 41 horizontal wells as operator and participated in six wells as nonoperator including two in which we own only a minor wellbore interest of these 49 total horizontal wells including our two initial wells 44 are in the wolfcamp b interval two are in the clearfork zone two are in the spraberry zone and one is in the cline zone thirtyseven of the 49 wells were completed and producing as of december 31 2013 and the other 12 are in various stages of completion the table below presents certain data regarding our producing horizontal wells excluding the two nonoperated wells in which we hold only a minor wellbore interest 





the production results from the wells in midland and upton counties along with geoscience and engineering data that we have gathered and analyzed and published results by other operators give us confidence that our acreage in midland and upton counties is prospective in the wolfcamp b interval additionally we believe the results of our operated wells in andrews county in the wolfcamp b and the clearfork intervals significantly reduces the hydrocarbon risks of our acreage in the vicinity of those wells 

pending acquisition 

we have entered into definitive purchase agreements dated february 14 2014 with unrelated third party sellers to acquire additional leasehold interests in martin county texas in the permian basin for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1740 million subject to certain adjustments this transaction includes 6450 gross 2825 net acres with a 438 working interest 75 net revenue interest and net production of approximately 1300 boed approximately 75 oil during the first two weeks of february 2014 based on information reported by the operator from 147 gross 63 net producing vertical wells net proved reserves based on our internal estimates as of december 31 2013 were approximately 4185 mboe our estimate of proved reserves is based on our analysis of production data provided by the sellers as well as available geologic and other data and we may revise our estimates following ownership of these properties we believe the acreage is prospective for horizontal drilling in the wolfcamp b lower spraberry middle spraberry wolfcamp a cline and clearfork horizons and have identified 42 potential horizontal drilling locations in each of the wolfcamp b and lower spraberry horizons based on 160 acre spacing per well or six across a section and an aggregate of 112 potential horizontal drilling 

locations in the middle spraberry wolfcamp a cline and clearfork intervals based on 240 acre spacing per well or four across a section under the terms of the existing joint operating agreement we have made offers to the owners of the remaining 562 of the working interests to acquire their interests in the acreage if all such owners were to sell their interests to us the aggregate purchase price would be approximately 3972 million we intend to finance the acquisition subject to market conditions and other factors with a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of new debt and equity securities we will become the operator of this acreage if and when two or more working interest holders with more than 50 of the working interest appoint us as the successor operator the acquisition is scheduled to close by the end of february 2014 however the transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed 

our business strategy 

our business strategy is to continue to profitably grow our business through the following 

 

with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities we are the operator of approximately 99 of our acreage this operational control allows us to more efficiently manage the pace of development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical applications including horizontal development our average 86 working interest in our acreage allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies 

 our strengths 

we believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals 

 

and wolfcamp b ryder scott has estimated gross eurs of 638 mboe for our wolfcamp b wells in andrews and midland counties which constitute 51 of our remaining pud horizontal wells and 604 mboe for our eastern upton county wolfcamp b wells which constitute 19 of our remaining pud horizontal wells in each case based on 7500 foot lateral lengths in addition we have approximately 182 square miles of proprietary 3d seismic data covering our acreage this data facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity including horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions 

 our properties 

location and land 

we acquired approximately 4174 net acres in west texas near midland in the permian basin on december 20 2007 with an effective date of november 1 2007 from exl petroleum lp ambrose energy i ltd and certain other sellers subsequently we acquired approximately 61764  additional net acres which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to approximately 65938  net acres at december 31 2013  we are the operator of approximately 99 of this permian basin acreage in addition we own mineral interests underlying approximately 15000 gross 12500 net acres in midland county texas and we are the operator of approximately 50 of the acreage associated with these mineral interests since our initial acquisition in the permian basin through december 31 2013 we drilled or participated in the drilling of 291 gross 251 net wells on our leasehold acreage in this area primarily targeting the wolfberry play the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties 

exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play as of december 31 2013  we held interests in 351 gross 306 net producing wells 

  

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid mississippianpennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the ouachita fold belt it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations in this report we refer to the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play of the midland basin lies in the area where the historically productive spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of the emerging wolfcamp play the spraberry was deposited as turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberry and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found in the reservoirs 

the wolfberry play can be generally characterized as a combination of lowpermeability clastic carbonate and shale reservoirs which are hydrocarboncharged and are economic due to the overall thickness of the section more than 3000 feet and application of enhanced stimulation fracking techniques the wolfberry is an unconventional “basincentered oil” resource play in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

several shale intervals within the wolfcamp formation are currently being evaluated for horizontal development potential and initial drilling to explore these intervals commenced in 2012 the shales exhibit microdarcy permeabilities which result in relatively small drainage areas and recovery factors because of this we believe the horizontal exploitation of these reservoirs will supplement and not replace our vertical development program 

there are also productive carbonate and shale intervals within the shallower permian clearfork formation two shale intervals within the clearfork formation are currently being evaluated for potential horizontal development below the wolfcamp formation lie the pennsylvanian strawn and atoka formations although difficult to predict there are conventional pay intervals that develop locally within these formations which when present can add significant reserves 

debris flows within the spraberry and wolfcamp carbonates have been observed on 3d seismic surveys initial tests have confirmed the presence of enhanced reservoir additionally structural closures have been mapped and are being evaluated for drilling to test deeper targets our extensive geophysical database which includes approximately 182 square miles of proprietary 3d seismic data will be used to enhance grading of future locations 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2013  net production from our permian basin acreage was 2672244  boe or an average of 7321  boed of which approximately 76 was oil 13 was natural gas liquids and 11 was natural gas 

facilities 

our land oil and gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilgaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

  

future activity 

during 2014 we expect to drill an estimated 65 to 75 gross 52 to 60 net horizontal wells and 20 to 25 gross 16 to 20 net vertical wells on our acreage we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be between 4250 million and 4750 million which includes costs for infrastructure and nonoperated wells but does not include the cost of any land acquisitions including the pending acquisition during the year ended december 31 2013  we drilled 38 gross 37 net horizontal wells and 39 gross 33 net vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross two net nonoperated wells in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2013  our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and oil gas infrastructure were 2977 million  and we spent an additional 6400 million  for leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions 

oil and natural gas data 

proved reserves 

sec rulemaking activity 

in december 2008 the securities and exchange commission or sec released its final rule for “modernization of oil and gas reporting” these rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area using the arithmetic 12month average beginningofthemonth price for the year as opposed to yearend prices as had previously been required unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used other significant amendments included the following 

 we adopted the rules effective december 31 2009 as required by the sec 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates as of december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 were prepared by ryder scott with respect to our assets in the permian basin 

ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers ryder scott is a thirdparty engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis 

  

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our proved reserves as of december 31 2013  were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second 

determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 85 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 15 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our vice president—reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our vice president—reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 26 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

   

 the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 based on the reserve report prepared by ryder scott each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental united states 





the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“ risk factors ” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2013  our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 22811  mbbls of oil 30251  mmcf of natural gas and 5732  mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 33585  mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

  

changes in puds that occurred during 2013 were primarily due to 

 

costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 766 million during 2013 estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 201 million in 2014 166 million in 2015 109 million in 2016 and 26 million in 2017 since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

all of our pud drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2018 

as of december 31 2013  2 of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and natural gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 



1 after giving effect to our derivative instruments the average prices per bbl of oil and per boe were 8975 and 7514 respectively during the year ended december 31 2013  7968 and 6447 respectively during the year ended december 31 2012  and 9215 and 7905 respectively during the year ended december 31 2011 

productive wells 

as of december 31 2013  we owned an average 87 working interest in 351 gross 306 net productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2013  relating to our leasehold acreage 

  





undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2013  that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 

  



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



as of december 31 2013  we had 15 gross 13 net wells in the process of drilling completing or dewatering or shut in awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table 

title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we market the majority of the oil and natural gas production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties we sell our natural gas production to purchasers at market prices in march 2009 we entered into an agreement with windsor midstream llc or midstream an entity controlled by wexford during 2010 and 2011 midstream purchased a significant portion of our oil volumes effective december 1 2011 we ceased all sales of our production under this agreement and effective january 1 2012 the agreement was canceled we sell all of our natural gas under contracts with terms of greater than twelve months and all of our oil under contracts with terms of twelve months or less excluding a five year oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company or shell trading described below 

  

we normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp  37  and shell trading us company  37  for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the year ended december 31 2011 one purchaser midstream accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed however based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers 

on may 24 2012 we entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell trading in which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to shell trading upon completion of the reversal of the magellan longhorn pipeline and its conversion for oil shipment which occurred on october 1 2013 our agreement with shell trading has an initial term of five years from the completion date the agreement may also be terminated by shell trading by written notice to us in the event that shell trading’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated our maximum delivery obligation under this agreement is 8000 gross barrels per day we have a onetime right to elect to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity which decreased contract quantity will be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement shell trading has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the new york mercantile exchange over the onemonth period as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in the agreement if we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement during any threemonth period following the service commencement date we have agreed to pay shell trading a deficiency payment which is calculated by multiplying i the volume of oil that we failed to deliver as required under the agreement during such period by ii magellan’s longhorn spot tariff rate in effect for transportation from crane texas to the houston ship channel for the period of time for which such deficiency volume is calculated 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems the oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm where it is further transported by pipeline our natural gas is generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through our gathering system 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed construction of a gas gathering system that transports our gas stream to a sour gas pipeline thereby eliminating the processing and treating expense by the end of 2013 we were moving 70 of our produced water by pipeline directly into commercial salt water disposal wells rather than by truck thereby further reducing one of the largest components of loe we believe that the completion of gathering systems the connection to salt water disposal wells and other actions will help us to reduce our lease operating expense in future periods 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1875 to 2500 resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 8125 to 7500 

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

  

environmental matters and regulation 

our oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous federal state and local governmental agencies such as the us environmental protection agency or the epa issue regulations which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically sensitive and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities the strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling  the resource conservation and recovery act as amended or rcra and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions however we cannot assure you that the epa or state or local governments will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended also known as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally imposes strict and joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released 

water discharges  the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act or opa and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak these laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on october 20 2011 the epa announced a schedule to develop pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from underground coalbed and shale formations the epa stated that it will gather data consult with stakeholders including ongoing consultation with industry and solicit public comment on a proposed rule for coalbed methane in 2013 and a proposed rule for shale gas in 2014 costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 

noncompliance with the clean water act or opa may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions  the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “—regulation of hydraulic fracturing” these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 

climate change in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities the epa finalized the motor vehicle rule in april 2010 and it became effective in january 2011 the epa adopted the stationary source rule also known as the “tailoring rule” in may 2010 and it also became effective in january 2011 although on october 15 2013 the us supreme court announced it will review aspects of the rule in 2014 additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gasdistribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 

the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries such as the september 2013 proposed ghg rule that if finalized would set new source performance standards for new coalfired and naturalgas fired power plants which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result of this continued regulatory focus future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry and state and local climate change initiatives and at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production the federal safe drinking water act or sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control or uic program hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the uic program and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions the epa however has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program specifically as “class ii” uic wells at the same time the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration—wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities moreover the epa announced on october 20 2011 that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant as part of these studies the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process these studies depending on their results could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 

legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress 

on august 16 2012 the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds or vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january 1 2015 the epa received numerous requests for 

reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed the epa intends to issue revised rules that are likely responsive to some of these requests for example on april 12 2013 the epa published a proposed amendment extending compliance dates for certain storage vessels the final revised rules could require modifications to our operations or increase our capital and operating costs without being offset by increased product capture at this point we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty in addition the us department of the interior published a revised proposed rule on may 24 2013 that would update existing regulation for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands including requirements for disclosure well bore integrity and handling of flowback water 

  

in addition there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing’s potential impacts the results of which are expected in 2014 these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities the us department of energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulicfracturing completion methods additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the sec to investigate the naturalgas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 

several states including texas have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process effective as of september 1 2011 the texas railroad commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit after february 1 2012 the new law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production 

  

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

the location of wells 

the method of drilling and casing wells 

the timing of construction or drilling activities including seasonal wildlife closures 

the rates of production or “allowables” 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled 

the plugging and abandoning of wells and 

notice to and consultation with surface owners and other third parties 

state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate the us army corps of engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment decommissioning and site restoration although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 

natural gas sales and transportation  historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that 

significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or at marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations 

oil sales and transportation  sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future 

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation  texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 

  

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil business involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation 

pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see “item 1a risk factors—risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 68 full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland and in oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in “item 1 business” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face we could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that we currently deem to be immaterial if any of these risks actually occurs it could materially harm our business financial conditional or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

a significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2013 our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions drilling and infrastructure were approximately 9377 million  our 2014 capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is currently estimated to be approximately 4250 million to 4750 million representing an increase of 48 over our 2013 capital budget since completing our initial public offering in october 2012 we have financed capital expenditures primarily with borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and the senior notes 

we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations proceeds from offerings of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2014 could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the 

failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs if we are unable to replace our current production the value of our reserves will decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors including 

• recoverable reserves 

• future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials 

• operating costs and 

• potential environmental and other liabilities 

the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken even when problems are identified the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms 

competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements further the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions 

no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions including our recently completed and pending acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial 

position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 

acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 

our analysis of the acreage subject to the pending martin county acquisition was based in part on information provided to us by the sellers and the limited representations warranties and indemnifications of the sellers contained in the purchase agreements which may prove to be incorrect resulting in our not realizing the expected benefits of the acquisition 

our analysis of the acreage subject to the pending martin county acquisition including our estimates of the associated proved reserves is based in part on information provided to us by the sellers including historical production data our independent reserve engineers have not reviewed nor have they provided any estimates with respect to the assets subject to the pending acquisition as a result the assumptions on which our internal estimates of proved reserves and horizontal drilling locations included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways resulting in our not realizing our expected benefits of the acquisition in addition the representations warranties and indemnities of the sellers contained in the purchase agreements are limited and we may not have recourse against the sellers in the event that the acreage does not perform as expected 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history from inception through december 31 2013 we drilled a total of 270 gross wells and participated in an additional 22 gross nonoperated wells of which 277 wells were completed as producing wells and 15 wells were in various stages of completion if the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

as of december 31 2013 we had 848 gross 791 net identified potential vertical drilling locations on our existing acreage based on 40acre spacing an additional 1128 gross 1027 net identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20acre downspacing and we have also identified 1430 gross 1148 net potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage as of december 31 2013 only 206 of our gross identified potential vertical drilling locations and 43 of our identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs drilling results and the availability of water further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation in addition we have identified 1076 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells which are necessarily more speculative and based on results from other operators whose acreage may not be consistent with ours we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable or whether wells drilled on 20acre downspacing will produce at the same rates as those on 40acre spacing the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business while through december 31 2013 we are the operator of or have participated in a total of 49 horizontal wells on our acreage we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from these or other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2013 we had leases representing 1926  net acres expiring in 2014 19604  net acres expiring in 2015 11725  net acres expiring in 2016 1180  net acres expiring in 2017 and no  net acres expiring in 2018 the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2014 and 2015 we will need to operate at least a fourrig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

the volatility of oil and natural gas prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our profitability 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including 

 

 these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty for example during the past five years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of 3403 per barrel or bbl in february 2009 to a high of 11339 per bbl in april 2011 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of 182 per million british thermal units or mmbtu in april 2012 to a high of 751 per mmbtu in january 2010 during 2013 west texas intermediate prices ranged from 8665 to 11062 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 308 to 452 per mmbtu on december 31 2013 the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was 9817 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 431 per mmbtu any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development results deteriorate full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 

we have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional price swap derivatives for a portion of our production which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate pricing argus louisiana light sweet pricing or intercontinental exchange or ice pricing for brent crude oil the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 

as of december 31 2013 we have crude oil swap contracts in place covering argus louisiana light sweet crude oil priced at a weighted average price of 9878 for 944000 aggregate bbls for the production period of january  december 2014 and a price of 10100 per bbl for 31000 aggregate bbls for the production period of january 2015 as of december 31 2013 we also have a crude oil swap contract in place covering ice brent crude oil priced at a price of 10970 for 120000 bbls for the production period of january  april 2014 our current goal is to hedge from 40 to 70 of our production the contracts described above and any future economic hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase in addition these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in 

the price of oil accordingly our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 

our derivative transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our derivative transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 122 million at december 31 2013 and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 248 million at december 31 2013 joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2013 two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp  37  and shell trading us company  37  for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the year ended december 31 2011 one purchaser windsor midstream llc an entity controlled by wexford our equity sponsor accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 2463  2390 and 2541 for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was 658 million 258 million and 154 million respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we may however experience ceiling test write downs in the future see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and 

estimates—method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties ” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves and eurs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 are based on reports prepared by ryder scott which conducted a wellbywell review of all our properties for the periods covered by its reserve reports using information provided by us the eurs for our horizontal wells and the proved reserves attributable to our pending acquisition in martin county are based on management’s internal estimates over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in accordance with the revised sec guidelines applicable to reserve estimates for such periods reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves and our pv10 are not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves 

the present value of future net cash flow from our proved reserves or standardized measure and our related pv10 calculation may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flow from our estimated proved reserves on the 12month average oil index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the firstdayofthemonth price for each month and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 

actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than current estimates in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standard board codification 932 “extractive activities—oil and gas” may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

sec rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 

sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

approximately 53 of our total estimated proved reserves as of december 31 2013  were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves 

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 

all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above as of december 31 2013  all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field 

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of natural gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp  37  and shell trading us company  37  for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the year ended december 31 2011 one purchaser windsor midstream llc an entity controlled by wexford our equity sponsor accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies oilfield services or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent 

third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us in addition although we intend to increase the number of rigs we have operating in 2014 we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations during the last two years texas has experienced extreme drought conditions as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or we are unable to effectively utilize flowback water we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

declining general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european debt crisis the united states mortgage market and a weak real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy these factors combined with volatile prices of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other countries concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates further worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil natural gas and natural gas liquids affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history 

diamondback energy inc was incorporated in delaware on december 30 2011 prior to october 11 2012 all of our historical oil and natural gas assets operations and results described in this report were those of windsor permian and windsor ut which prior to our initial public offering were entities controlled by our equity sponsor wexford immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering windsor permian became our whollyowned subsidiary and we acquired the oil and natural gas assets of gulfport energy corporation or gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for shares of our common stock and a promissory note in a transaction we refer to as the gulfport transaction the oil and natural gas properties described in this report have been acquired by windsor permian gulfport and windsor ut since december 2007 as a result there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as a recentlyformed company growth in accordance with our business plan if achieved could place a significant strain on our financial technical operational and management resources as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

we incurred a net loss of 365 million for the year ended december 31 2012 our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition to the extent we engage in horizontal drilling those activities may adversely affect our ability to successfully drill in one or more of our identified vertical drilling locations furthermore certain of the new techniques we are adopting such as infill drilling and multiwell pad drilling may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to in the case of infill drilling offset wells being shut in and in the case of multiwell pad drilling the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations for example on certain occasions we have experienced high line pressure at our tank batteries with occasional flaring due to the inability of the gas gathering systems in the areas in which we operate to support the increased production of natural gas in the permian basin if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production in addition the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to 

curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance excessive pressure ability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas physical damage to the gathering or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases we are provided with limited if any notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and natural gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue see item 1 “ business—regulation ” for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production the federal safe drinking water act or sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control or uic program hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the uic program and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions the environmental protection agency or epa however has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program specifically as “class ii” uic wells at the same time the white house council on environmental quality is conducting an administrationwide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities moreover the epa announced on october 20 2011 that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant as part of these studies the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process these studies depending on their results could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 

legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds or vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production 

equipment these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january 1 2015 the epa received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community and court challenges to the rules were also filed the epa intends to issue revised rules that are likely responsive to some of these requests for example on april 12 2013 the epa published a proposed amendment extending compliance dates for certain storage vessels the final revised rules could require modifications to our operations or increase our capital and operating costs without being offset by increased product capture at this point we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty in addition the us department of the interior published a revised proposed rule on may 24 2013 that would update existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands including requirements for disclosure well bore integrity and handling of flowback water 

in addition there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing’s potential impacts the results of which are expected in 2014 

these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities the us department of energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulicfracturing completion methods additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 

several states including texas have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas railroad commission recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal occupational safety and health act or osha to state regulators and on a public internet website we plan to use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and natural gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and 

completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws moreover public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act hr 4173 which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission or cftc has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the cftc’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the cftc to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the cftc has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the cftc will finalize certain other related 

rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

proposed changes to us tax laws if adopted could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the us president’s fiscal year 2014 budget proposal includes provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws these changes include but are not limited to i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development iii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and iv implementing certain international tax reforms these proposed changes in the us tax laws if adopted or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities the epa finalized the motor vehicle rule in april 2010 and it became effective in january 2011 the epa adopted the stationary source rule also known as the “tailoring rule” in may 2010 and it also became effective in january 2011 although on october 15 2013 the us supreme court announced it will review aspects of the rule in 2014 additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gasdistribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 

the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries such as the september 2013 proposed ghg rule that if finalized would set new source performance standards for new coalfired and naturalgas fired power plants which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as a result of this continued regulatory focus future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the 

future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry and state and local climate change initiatives and at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 or the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore is exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the nga however the distinction between ferc—regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in areas of high industry activity which may affect our ability to hire train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets 

our operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the permian basin in west texas an area in which industry activity has increased rapidly as a result demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future moreover our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 

any delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could lead to a reduction in production volumes any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the 

retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

a significant reduction by wexford of its ownership interest in us could adversely affect us 

prior to october 11 2012 wexford beneficially owned 100 of our equity interests upon completion of our initial public offering wexford beneficially owned approximately 444 of our common stock as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock by us and sales of our common stock by affiliates of wexford as of december 31 2013 wexford beneficially owned approximately 226 of our common stock further the chairman of our board of directors is an affiliate of wexford we believe that wexford’s substantial ownership interest in us provides wexford with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful wexford is not subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time thereafter to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us if wexford sells all or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us wexford may have less incentive to assist in our success and its affiliates that serve as members of our board of directors may resign such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies which could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations we also receive certain services including drilling services from entities controlled by wexford these service contracts may generally be terminated on 30days notice in the event wexford ceases to own a significant ownership interest in us such services may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 

we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we are unable to timely comply with section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant our profitability stock price results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

as of december 31 2013 we are required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls during the course of our integration of our internal control over financial reporting we may identify areas requiring improvement and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review we believe that the outofpocket costs the diversion of management’s attention from running the daytoday operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could be significant if the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations our results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results 

we recorded stockbased compensation expense in 2012 and 2013 and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards we recorded 2983000 and 6294000 of compensation expense in 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other indebtedness 

as of december 31 2013 we had total longterm debt of 4600 million including 4500 million outstanding under the senior notes and borrowing base availability of 2150 million under our revolving credit facility we may in the future incur significant additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or otherwise in order to make acquisitions to develop our properties or for other purposes 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you and affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 

 a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility the indenture governing the senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the 

requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under our revolving credit facility if default occurs the lenders under our revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and the senior notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 

availability under our revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of 2250 million the borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding borrowings of 100 million which bore a weighted average interest rate of 167 we intend to continue borrowing under our revolving credit facility in the future any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow further if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination we would be required to repay the excess we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing we may have to sell significant assets any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness including the senior notes depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures selling assets restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive however we cannot assure you that undertaking alternative financing plans if necessary would allow us to meet our debt obligations in the absence of such cash flows we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes restrict but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so as of december 31 2013 our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was set at 2250 million and we had outstanding borrowings of 100 million under this facility in addition the indenture governing the senior notes allows us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors the indenture governing the senior notes also allows us to incur certain other 

additional secured debt and allows us to have subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes and which may incur additional debt which would be structurally senior to the senior notes in addition the indenture governing the senior notes does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness if we or a guarantor incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the senior notes or with the guarantees thereof including additional unsecured indebtedness or trade payables the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the senior notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us or a guarantor if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 

our borrowings under our revolving credit facility expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility which bear interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime rate libor or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 05 to 250 depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2013 we had 100 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 167 if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our common stock 

our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders 

as of december 31 2013 wexford and gulfport beneficially owned approximately 226 and 72 respectively of our common stock in addition individuals affiliated with wexford and gulfport serve on our board of directors as a result wexford and gulfport together are able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership makes it difficult for any other holder or group of holders of our common stock to be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business the interests of wexford and gulfport with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us such as future acquisitions financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders this continued concentrated ownership will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares unless wexford and gulfport approve the acquisition 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable wexford our equity sponsor or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies these transactions include among others drilling services provided to us by bison drilling and field services llc or bison real property leased by us from fasken midland llc and caliber investment croup llc hydraulic fracturing sand purchased by us from muskie proppant llc or muskie and certain administrative services provided to us by everest operations management llc each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with wexford and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts for a discussion of potential conflicts see “ —risks related to our common stock—our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders ” 

we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company which may significantly affect our financial condition 

we completed our initial public offering in october 2012 as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as rules implemented by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 

since the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeded 700 million as of june 30 2013 we ceased to be an “emerging growth company” as of december 31 2013 and as a result expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act see “—risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—we are subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we are unable to timely comply with section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant our profitability and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected ” 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 

 the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such future sales may occur may cause our stock price to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock except for any shares purchased by our affiliates all of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our subsequent equity offering are freely tradable in connection with our initial public offering we also granted db energy holdings llc or db holdings and gulfport and their respective affiliates certain registration rights obligating us to register with the sec their shares of our common stock in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the market perceives that such sales may occur the price of our stock could decline 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 

 these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders 

we have not paid dividends since our inception and we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition results of operations contractual restrictions capital requirements business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors in addition the terms of our revolving credit facility prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions as a result only appreciation of the price of our common stock which may not occur will provide a return to our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in september 2010 windsor permian now known as diamondback og llc purchased certain property in goodhue county minnesota that was prospective for hydraulic fracturing grade sand prior to the purchase the prior owners of the property had entered into a mineral development agreement with the plaintiff and windsor permian purchased the property subject to that agreement windsor permian subsequently contributed the property to muskie in an amended complaint filed in november 2012 by the plaintiff against the prior owners of the property windsor permian and certain affiliates of windsor permian in the first judicial district court in goodhue county minnesota the plaintiff seeks damages from the company and the other defendants alleging among other things interference with contractual relationship interference with prospective advantage and unjust enrichment in an order filed on may 24 2013 the judge denied certain motions made by the defendants and set a trial date to determine liability with a damage phase of the matter to commence on a later date if there is a determination of liability following a trial on the liability phase on june 21 2013 the jury determined that the defendants intentionally interfered with plaintiff’s contract but that the interference did not cause the plaintiff to be unable to acquire mining permits prior to the enactment of the moratorium by goodhue county in an order filed on july 10 2013 the judge ordered the damage phase to be set for trial following a pretrial and scheduling conference and the parties have agreed upon a schedule for pretrial activities subsequently the plaintiff disclosed a new damage theory and the defendants filed motions with the court to dismiss plaintiff’s claims on the grounds that the damage claim is speculative and that plaintiff cannot prove damages as a matter of law plaintiff also filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to assert a punitive damage claim the motions were argued in december 2013 and we currently anticipate a ruling before the end of march 2014 we believe these claims are without merit and will continue to vigorously defend this action while management has determined that the possibility of loss is remote litigation is inherently uncertain and management cannot determine the amount of loss if any that may result 

we could be subject to various possible loss contingencies which arise primarily from interpretation of federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry such contingencies include differing interpretations as to the prices at which natural gas and crude oil sales may be made the prices at which royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases environmental issues and other matters management believes it has complied with the various laws and regulations administrative rulings and interpretations 

due to the nature of our business we are from time to time involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities including workers’ compensation claims and employment related disputes in the opinion of our management none of the pending litigation disputes or claims against us if decided adversely will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations

recent developments 

pending acquisition 

we have entered into definitive purchase agreements dated february 14 2014 with unrelated third party sellers to acquire additional leasehold interests in martin county texas in the permian basin for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1740 million subject to certain adjustments this transaction includes 6450 gross 2825 net acres with a 438 working interest 75 net revenue interest and net production of approximately 1300 boed approximately 75 oil during the first two weeks of february 2014 based on information reported by the operator from 147 gross 63 net producing vertical wells net proved reserves based on our internal estimates as of december 31 2013 were approximately 4185 mboe our estimate of proved reserves is based on our analysis of production data provided by the sellers as well as available geologic and other data and we may revise our estimates following ownership of these properties we believe the acreage is prospective for horizontal drilling in the wolfcamp b lower spraberry middle spraberry wolfcamp a cline and clearfork horizons and have identified 42 potential horizontal drilling locations in each of the wolfcamp b and lower spraberry horizons based on 160 acre spacing per well or six across a section and an aggregate of 112 potential horizontal drilling locations in the middle spraberry wolfcamp a cline and clearfork intervals based on 240 acre spacing per well or four across a section under the terms of the existing joint operating agreement we have made offers to the owners of the remaining 562 of the working interests to acquire their interests in the acreage if all such owners were to sell their interests to us the aggregate purchase price would be approximately 3972 million we intend to finance the acquisition subject to market conditions and other factors with a combination of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of new debt and equity securities we will become the operator of this acreage if and when two or more working interest holders with more than 50 of the working interest appoint us as the successor operator the acquisition is scheduled to close by the end of february 2014 however the transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed

basis of presentation 

transfers of a business between entities under common control are accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period and prior years are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information as discussed above the windsor ut contribution was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control accordingly the financial information and production data contained in this report have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of windsor ut at historical carrying values and its operations prior to october 11 2012 the effective date of the windsor ut contribution 

since we began operations in 2007 we have increased our drilling activity evaluated potential acquisitions and added to our acreage portfolio because of our growth through acquisitions and development of our properties our historical results of operations and periodtoperiod comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 

operating results overview 

during the year ended december 31 2013  our average daily production was approximately 7321  boed consisting of 5542  bblsd of oil 4741  mcfd of natural gas and 989  bblsd of natural gas liquids an increase of 4375  boed or 149  from average daily production of 2946  boed for the year ended december 31 2012  consisting of 2066  bblsd of oil 2277  mcfd of natural gas and 500  bblsd of natural gas liquids 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we drilled 77 gross 70 net wells and participated in an additional 4 gross 2 net nonoperated wells in the permian basin 

reserves and pricing 

ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  our revenues were derived 91 and 88 respectively from oil sales 6 and 9 respectively from natural gas liquids sales and 3 and 3 respectively from natural gas sales our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2013 west texas intermediate posted prices ranged from 8665 to 11062 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 308 to 452 per mmbtu on december 31 2013 the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was 9817 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 431 per mmbtu 

to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices from timetotime we enter into derivative arrangements for our crude oil and natural gas production we utilize commodity derivatives to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate pricing argus louisiana light sweet pricing and inter–continental exchange or ice pricing for brent crude oil while these derivative contracts stabilize our cash flows when market prices are below our contract prices they also prevent us from realizing increases in our cash flow when market prices are higher than our contract prices we will sustain cash and noncash losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and conversely we will sustain cash and noncash gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices our derivatives contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and as a result gains or losses on derivatives contracts are recorded as other income expense in our statements of operations for the yearend status of our derivatives see note 12—derivatives and for derivative contracts entered into subsequent to december 31 2013 see note 15—subsequent events in the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production and ad valorem taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment expense  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income  this represents the interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense  we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions we reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense in addition we include the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense 

gainloss on derivative instruments  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of noncash gains and losses associated with our open derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our cash gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

loss from equity investment  this line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our investment in the membership interests of muskie an equity method investment 

income tax expense  prior our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes at the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 



1 after giving effect to our derivative instruments the average prices per bbl of oil and per boe were 8975 and 7514 respectively during the year ended december 31 2013  7968 and 6447 respectively during the year ended december 31 2012  and 9215 and 7905 respectively during the year ended december 31 2011 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 133040000  or 177  to 208002000  for the year ended december 31 2013  from 74962000  for the year ended december 31 2012  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 4375  boed to 7321  boed during the year ended december 31 2013  from 2946  boed during the year ended december 31 2012  the total increase in revenue of approximately 133040000  was largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and the effect for the full year in 2013 of the contribution of gulfport’s permian basin assets on october 11 2012 in connection with our initial public offering our production increased by 1266463  bbls of oil 177965  bbls of natural gas liquids and 896981  mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  the net dollar effect of the increases in prices of approximately 13768000  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 119272000  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 





lease operating expense  lease operating expense or loe was 21157000   792  per boe for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 5910000  or 39  from 15247000   1414  per boe for the year ended december 31 2012  the increase was due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions which resulted in 126 gross 105 net additional producing wells at december 31 2013 as compared to december 31 2012 on a per boe basis loe declined successively for each quarter throughout 2013 as new volumes came on line and expenses were held in line or were reduced by the end of 2013 we were moving 70 of our produced water by pipeline directly into commercial salt water disposal wells rather than by truck thereby further reducing one of the largest components of loe 

production and ad valorem tax expense  production and ad valorem taxes increased to 12899000  for the year ended december 31 2013 from 5237000  for the year ended december 31 2012  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during 2013 our production taxes per boe increased by 2 as compared to 2012 primarily reflecting the impact of higher 

oil and natural gas prices on production taxes our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties and an increase in the number of wells included in those valuations as a result of our 2013 drilling activity 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization or dda expense increased 40324000  or 153  from 26273000  for the year ended december 31 2012  to 66597000 for the year ended december 31 2013  the average depletion rate was 2492 for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2436 for the year ended december 31 2012 the average depletion rate includes oil and gas depletion and other property and equipment depreciation 

the following table provides components of our dda expense for the periods presented 



the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 40049000 and 073 per boe for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from higher total production levels increased net book value on new reserves added and an increase in capitalized interest to the full cost pool 

general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense increased 660000  from 10376000  for the year ended december 31 2012  to 11036000  for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase was due to increases in salary legal and compliance services professional service and advisory service expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  was 8058000  as compared to 3607000  for the year ended december 31 2012  an increase of 4451000  or 123  this increase was due primarily to the interest expense associated with the senior notes 

derivatives  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  we had a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of 7218000  and 5440000  respectively for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  we had a noncash gain on open derivative instruments of 5346000  and 8057000  respectively 

income tax expense  prior to our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes as of october 11 2012 the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000 for the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a deferred income tax expense of 54903000 income tax expense of 761000 was incurred as a result of operations from october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 for the year ended december 31 2013  our provision for income taxes was 31754000 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 27087000  or 57  to 74962000 for the year ended december 31 2012 from 47875000 for the year ended december 31 2011  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 1288  boed to 2946  boed during the year ended december 31 2012 from 1658  boed during the year ended december 31 2011  the total increase in revenue of approximately 27087000  was largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and the effect of the contribution of gulfport’s permian basin assets during the period october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 the revenue increase attributable to the contribution of assets from gulfport during the period october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 was 7353000 our production increased by 306852  bbls of oil 96299  bbls of natural gas liquids and 419876  mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 8183000  calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 35270000  calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices are shown below 





lease operating expense  we have reclassified 2012 ad valorem tax amounts from lease operating expenses to production and ad valorem taxes to conform with the current year’s presentation lease operating expense was 15247000 1414 per boe for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of  5316000  or 54  from  9931000   1641  per boe for the year ended december 31 2011  the increase was due to increased drilling activity which resulted in additional producing wells for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  our lease operating expense during both periods was adversely impacted by the cost of processing and treating nonhydrocarbon gases from certain of our wells that came online in 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed construction of a gas gathering system that transports our gas stream to a sour gas pipeline thereby eliminating the monthly processing and treating expense we believe that the completion of gathering systems the connection to salt water disposal wells and other actions will help us to further reduce our lease operating expense in future periods 

production and ad valorem tax expense  production and ad valorem taxes increased to 5237000  for the year ended december 31 2012 from 3032000  during the year ended december 31 2011  in general production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes however texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices during 2012 our production taxes per boe decreased by 6 as compared to 2011 primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties and an increase in the number of wells included in those valuations as a result of our 2012 drilling activity 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization expense increased 10672000  or 68  from 15601000 for the year ended december 31 2011  to 26273000 for the year ended december 31 2012 the average depletion rate was 2436 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2578 for the year ended december 31 2011  the average depletion rate includes oil and gas depletion and other property and equipment depreciation 

the following table provides components of our dda expense for the periods presented 



the increase in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of 10395000 and decrease of 151 per boe for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 resulted primarily from higher total production levels and the decrease in depletion rate per boe was due to an increase in proved reserves at december 31 2012 

general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense increased 6721000  from 3655000 for the year ended december 31 2011  to 10376000 for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was due to increases in salary legal professional service and contract labor expenses these increases were partially offset by increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity in connection with our initial public offering we incurred a nonrecurring charge to our fourth quarter general and administrative expense of approximately 27 million for executive bonuses and noncash equity based compensation expense associated with such offering 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 3607000 as compared to 2517000 for the year ended december 31 2011  an increase of 1090000  this increase was due primarily to an increase in our weighted average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement to 77489000 for the year ended december 31 2012 from 68420000 for 2011 

derivatives  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and noncash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments net” for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of 5440000 and 37000 respectively for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a noncash gain on open derivative instruments of 8057000 and a noncash loss on open derivative instruments of 12972000 respectively 

income tax expense  prior to our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes as of october 11 2012 the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a deferred income tax expense of 54903000 income tax expense of 761000 was incurred as a result of operations from october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes cash flows from operations and prior to the completion of our initial public offering capital contributions and loans from our equity sponsor our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011 are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 155777000  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 49692000  for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in operating cash flows is primarily a result of increases in our oil and natural gas revenues due to production growth and by lower expenses in 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities was 49692000 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 30998000 for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in operating cash flows is largely due to increased production which was a result of our increased drilling activities throughout 2012 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

investing activities 

the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities we used cash for investing activities of 940140000  183078000  and 81108000 during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011 respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we spent 297713000  on capital expenditures in conjunction with our infrastructure projects and drilling program in which we drilled 77 gross 70 net wells and participated in the drilling of an additional four gross two net nonoperated wells we spent an additional 444083000  on the acquisition of mineral rights 177343000  on the acquisition of leasehold interests 2234000  for the purchase of other property and equipment 289000  net on the settlement of nonhedge derivative instruments and 18550000 for the postclosing cash adjustment associated with the gulfport transaction our acquisition of mineral interests underlying approximately 15000 gross 12500 net acres in midland county texas in the permian basin was completed on september 19 2013 the mineral interests entitle us to receive an average 195 royalty interest on all production from this acreage with no additional future capital or operating expense required in september 2013 we also completed two leasehold acquisitions in martin county texas and dawson county texas for an aggregate purchase price of 166635000 subject to adjustment 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we spent 100090000 on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 65 gross 44 net wells we spent an additional 11707000 on the acquisition of leasehold interests 1102000 for the purchase of other property and equipment and 6637000 net on the settlement of derivative transactions on october 11 2012 we acquired all of the oil and natural gas properties of gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for i 7914036 shares of our common stock ii 63590000 in the form of a noninterest bearing promissory note that was repaid in full upon the closing of our initial public offering and iii a postclosing cash adjustment of approximately 18550000 

during 2011 we spent 76470000 on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 56 gross 32 net wells we spent an additional 3704000 on leasehold costs 7065000 for the purchase of other property and equipment 4137000 for the purchase of certain assets real estate and leasehold interests which were subsequently contributed to muskie and 2460000 for the purchase of drilling rigs and other equipment which were subsequently contributed to bison these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of 6000000 from a partial sale of our equity investment 55000 from the sale of property and equipment and 76000 from the settlement of nonhedge derivative instruments and margin deposits 

our investing activities for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011 are summarized in the following table 



financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was 773560000  as compared to 152785000  for the year ended december 31 2012  the 2013 amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a the net proceeds of 1444 million from our may 2013 equity offering 1775 million from our august 2013 equity offering and 4500 million from our september 2013 senior note offering and b net borrowings of 100 million under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2012 we borrowed 150 million under our revolving credit facility and 300 million under our subordinated note with wexford and received capital contributions from our members of 40 million in both periods these proceeds were used primarily to acquire property and fund our drilling costs 

net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 was 152785000 as compared to 52950000 for 2011 on october 17 2012 our initial public offering was completed and we received net proceeds of approximately 2341 million after deducting the underwriting discount during 2012 we borrowed 150 million under our revolving credit facility all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were repaid with proceeds of the initial public offering during 2012 we borrowed 300 million under our subordinated note with wexford this note was repaid with proceeds of the initial public offering and was canceled during 2012 we received capital contributions from our members of 40 million these proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and purchase property during the year ended december 31 2012 we paid 29 million for costs associated with our initial public offering 

net cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was 52950000 during 2011 we borrowed 402 million under our revolving credit facility and received capital contributions from our members of 135 million these proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and purchase property and equipment 

senior notes 

on september 18 2013 we completed an offering of 4500 million  in aggregate principal amount of 7625  senior unsecured notes due 2021 which we refer to as the senior notes the senior notes bear interest at the rate of 7625  per annum payable semiannually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year commencing on april 1 2014 and will mature on october 1 2021 the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our subsidiaries the net proceeds from the senior notes were used to fund the acquisition of mineral interests underlying approximately 15000  gross  12500  net acres in midland county texas in the permian basin the senior notes were issued to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act and to certain nonus persons in accordance with regulation s under the securities act 

the senior notes were issued under and are governed by an indenture among us the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and wells fargo bank na as the trustee or the indenture we may issue additional senior notes under the indenture and all senior notes issued under the indenture will constitute part of a single class of securities for all purposes of the indenture on november 5 2013 we supplemented the indenture by the first supplemental indenture thereto to add a subsidiary guarantor of the senior notes the indenture contains certain covenants that subject to certain exceptions and qualifications among other things limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness make certain investments declare or pay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock prepay subordinated indebtedness sell assets including capital stock of subsidiaries agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets enter into transactions with affiliates incur liens engage in business other than the oil and gas business and designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries if we experience certain kinds of changes of control or if we sell certain of our assets holders of the senior notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their senior notes 

we have the option to redeem the senior notes in whole or in part at any time on or after october 1 2016 at the redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount of 105719  for the 12month period beginning on october 1 2016 103813  for the 12month period beginning on october 1 2017 101906  for the 12month period beginning on october 1 2018 and 100000  beginning on october 1 2019 and at any time thereafter with any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of redemption in addition prior to october 1 2016 we may redeem all or a part of the senior notes at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the redemption date plus a “makewhole” premium at the redemption date furthermore before october 1 2016 we may at any time or from time to time redeem up to 35  of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107625  of the principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption if at least 65  of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes originally issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 120 days of the closing date of such equity offering 

in connection with the issuance of the senior notes we and the subsidiary guarantors entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers on september 18 2013 pursuant to which we and the subsidiary guarantors have agreed to file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the senior notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the securities act under the registration rights agreement we also agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to become effective within 360 days after the issue date of the senior notes and to consummate the exchange offer 30 days after effectiveness we may be required to file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the senior notes under certain circumstances if we fail to satisfy certain of our obligations under the registration rights agreement we agreed to pay additional interest to the holders of the senior notes as specified in the registration rights agreement 

second amended and restated credit facility 

on october 15 2010 we entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with bnp paribas or bnp as the administrative agent sole book runner and lead arranger on may 10 2012 the revolving credit agreement was amended to provide for the resignation of bnp and the appointment of wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent for the lenders the credit agreement was amended and restated as of july 24 2012 and again as of november 1 2013 the credit agreement as so amended and restated provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of 600 million subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors the “borrowing base” the borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined semiannually with effective dates of april 1st and october 1st in addition we may request up to three additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12month period 

as of december 31 2013 the borrowing base was set at 2250 million as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding borrowings of 100 million which bore a weighted average interest rate of 167 based on preliminary discussions with the administrative agent for our revolving credit agreement we believe that after giving consideration to our reserve report dated december 31 2013 and the completion of our pending acquisition in martin county texas our reserves will support a borrowing base in the range of 3750 million to 4000 million 

the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime rate or libor plus margins ranging from 050 for primebased loans and 150 for libor loans to 150 for primebased loans and 250 for libor loans in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0375 to 050 per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage and is required to be repaid a to the extent the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise in some cases subject to a cure period b in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and c at the maturity date of november 1 2018 the loan is secured by substantially all of our assets 

the credit agreement contains various affirmative negative and financial maintenance covenants these covenants among other things limit additional indebtedness additional liens sales of assets mergers and consolidations dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below 



the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to 750 million in the form of senior or senior subordinated notes and in connection with any such issuance the reduction of the borrowing base by 25 of the stated principal amount of each such issuance a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid as of december 31 2013 we had 450 million of senior notes outstanding 

as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility as then in effect the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default the credit agreement contains customary events of default including nonpayment breach of covenants materially incorrect representations crossdefault bankruptcy and change of control with certain specified exceptions the terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility generally may be amended with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments to lend 

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

we currently anticipate our 2014 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure will be approximately 4250 million to 4750 million representing an increase of 48 over 2013 we estimate that of these expenditures approximately 

 

the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted 

based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2014 we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2014 however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2014 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions 

we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we may also consider the formation of a master limited partnership or other yield based vehicle with respect to our mineral interests in the permian basin we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013 





critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 2 of the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our combined consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the combined consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities stockbased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to 

drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser net of royalty interests discounts and allowances as applicable we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves no receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided 

impairment 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization impairment and deferred income taxes exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves less any related income tax effects the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense in calculating future net revenues prices are calculated as the average oil and gas prices during the preceding 12month period prior to the end of the current reporting period determined as the unweighted arithmetic average firstdayofthemonth prices for the prior 12month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public 

relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 

derivatives 

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we grant various types of stockbased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 9—stock and equity based compensation stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended 2013 2012 and 2011 although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently have no offbalance sheet arrangements please read note 14 included in notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10–k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales with respect to these fixed price swap contracts the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price our derivative contracts are based upon 

reported settlement prices on commodity exchanges with crude oil derivative settlements based on new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate pricing argus louisiana light sweet pricing or inter–continental exchange or ice pricing for brent crude oil 

at december 31 2013  we had a net asset derivative position with wells fargo bank na of 431000  related to our ice brent and argus louisiana light sweet fixed price swaps as compared to a net liability derivative position of 5205000 as of december 31 2012 related to our price swap derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our fixed price swaps with wells fargo bank na as of december 31 2013  a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset derivative position of these instruments to a net liability derivative position of 10471000 a decrease of 10902000 while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position of these instruments by 10902000 however any cash derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 12226000 at december 31 2013  and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 24836000 at december 31 2013  

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2013  two purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp  37  and shell trading us company  37  for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the year ended december 31 2011 one purchaser midstream accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2013  we had one customer that represented approximately 86 of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2012 we had one customer that represented approximately 97 of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to prime libor or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 05 to 250 depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of december 31 2013  the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings was 167 an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our net income of approximately 100000 based on the 10000000 outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility on december 31 2013 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure control and procedures 

 under the direction of our chief executive officer and vice president and chief financial officer we have established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms the disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

as of december 31 2013 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and vice president and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15b under the exchange act based upon our evaluation our chief executive officer and vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2013 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

as of december 31 2013 management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “internal control  integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment and those criteria management determined that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2013 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

grant thornton llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this annual report on form 10k has issued their report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2013 the report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2013 is included in this item under the heading “report of independent registered public accounting firm”

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas this basin which is one of the major producing basins in the united states is characterized by an extensive production history a favorable operating environment mature infrastructure long reserve life multiple producing horizons enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators 

we began operations in december 2007 with our acquisition of 4174 net acres with production at the time of acquisition of approximately 800 boed from 34 gross 168 net wells in the permian basin subsequently we acquired approximately 47429 additional net acres which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to 51603 net acres at december 31 2012 we are the operator of approximately 99 of this acreage as of december 31 2012 we had drilled 193 gross 176 net wells and participated in an additional 18 gross eight net nonoperated wells in the permian basin of these 211 gross wells 191 were completed as producing wells and 20 were in various stages of completion in the aggregate as of december 31 2012 we held interests in 225 gross 201 net producing wells in the permian basin 

our activities are primarily focused on the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations which we refer to collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural gas multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons extensive production history longlived reserves and high drilling success rates the wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the spraberry play the majority of which is designated in the spraberry trend area field according to the us energy information administration the spraberry trend area ranks as the second largest oilfield in the united states based on 2009 reserves 

as of december 31 2012 our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were 40210 mboe based on a reserve report prepared by ryder scott company lp or ryder scott our independent reserve engineers of these reserves approximately 295 are classified as proved developed producing or pdp proved undeveloped or pud reserves included in this estimate are from 306 vertical gross well locations on 40acre spacing and four gross horizontal well locations as of december 31 2012 these proved reserves were approximately 65 oil 21 natural gas liquids and 14 natural gas 

we have 881 identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40acre spacing based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data as of december 31 2012 and we have an additional 1118 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20acre downspacing we have also identified 731 potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage we intend to grow our reserves and production through development drilling exploitation and exploration activities on this multiyear project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves our estimated ultimate recoveries or eurs from future pud wells on 40acre spacing as 

estimated by ryder scott range from 102 mboe per well consisting of 46 mbbls of oil 151 mmcf of natural gas and 31 mbbls of natural gas liquids to 158 mboe per well consisting of 112 mbbls of oil 114 mmcf of natural gas and 27 mbbls of natural gas liquids with an average eur per well of 133 mboe consisting of 91 mbbls of oil 101 mmcf of natural gas and 25 mbbls of natural gas liquids we also intend to continue to refine our drilling pattern and completion techniques in an effort to increase our average eur per well from vertical wells drilled on 40acre spacing we currently anticipate a reduction of approximately 20 in our eurs from vertical wells drilled on 20acre spacing 

in 2012 we began testing the horizontal well potential of our acreage our first horizontal well was the janey 16h in upton county with a 3842 foot lateral in the wolfcamp b interval we are the operator of this well with a 100 working interest it was completed in june 2012 and had a 24hour initial production rate of 618 boed and a 30day average initial production rate of 486 boed of which 86 was oil through the end of 2012 the janey 16h had produced a total of 48 mbbls of oil and 62 mmcf of natural gas our second horizontal well was the kemmer 4209h in midland county it is a nonoperated well in which we own a 47 working interest it was completed in september 2012 in the wolfcamp b with a 3733 foot lateral the production as reported to us by the operator was a peak 24 hour rate of 892 boed and peak 30 day rate of 712 boed of which 85 was oil through the end of 2012 the kemmer 4209h had produced a total of 41 mbbls of oil and 45 mmcf of natural gas based on the decline curve analysis of the current production we anticipate that the eur for each of these wells will be in the range of 400 to 500 mboe 

in addition to the janey and kemmer wells as of february 28 2013 we had three additional horizontal wells in midland county and four horizontal wells in upton county in various stages of development in midland county we have drilled the st251h well 83 working interest with a lateral length of 4617 feet and are currently drilling the st252h well 83 working interest with a targeted lateral length of 4800 feet we have scheduled a 19 stage hydraulic fracturing operation for each of these wells with the frac on the st251h well expected to begin in early march 2013 and the frac on the st252h well scheduled immediately after that in midmarch also in midland county we are participating in the sarah ann 3812h which is a nonoperated well in which we have a 42 working interest it was drilled to a lateral length of 4461 feet targeting the wolfcamp b interval and recently completed an 18 stage frac 

in upton county we have drilled three additional wells the neal 81h 100 working interest with a lateral length of 7652 feet the neal 82h 100 working interest with a lateral length of 6658 feet and the janey 3h 100 working interest with a lateral length of 4629 feet we completed a 32 stage frac on the neal 81h well in late january 2013 as of february 26 2013 flowback operations were underway and for the last seven days the well averaged 806 boed with a peak rate of 871 boed with an 85 oil component a 28 stage frac is scheduled to begin on the neal 82h well by midmarch 2013 the janey 3h is currently undergoing a 19 stage frac and is expected to begin flowback in early march in addition we are currently drilling the kendra 1h well in upton county with a planned 7550 foot lateral 

the production results from the wells in midland and upton counties along with geoscience and engineering data that we have gathered and analyzed give us confidence that our acreage in midland and upton counties is prospective in the wolfcamp b interval based on the data we have we also believe that a large percentage of our other midland basin acreage is prospective for horizontal drilling this includes not only the wolfcamp b interval but other intervals ranging from the clearfork to the atoka however further testing of these areas and other intervals is necessary to determine their economic potential

our history 

diamondback energy inc or diamondback was incorporated in delaware on december 30 2011 and did not conduct any material business operations until october 11 2012 when diamondback merged with its parent entity diamondback energy llc with diamondback continuing as the surviving entity prior to the merger diamondback energy llc was a holding company and did not conduct any material business operations other than its ownership of diamondback’s common stock and the membership interests in windsor permian llc or windsor permian as a result of the merger windsor permian became a whollyowned subsidiary of diamondback also on october 11 2012 wexford capital lp or wexford our equity sponsor caused all of the outstanding equity interests in windsor ut llc or windsor ut to be contributed to windsor permian prior to the merger in a transaction we refer to as the “windsor ut contribution” the windsor ut contribution was treated as a combination of entities under common control with assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in a manner similar to a pooling of interests the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes on the date of the merger a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000  we refer to the historical results of windsor permian and windsor ut prior to october 11 2012 as our “predecessors” 

immediately after the merger on october 11 2012 we acquired from gulfport energy corporation or gulfport all of gulfport’s oil and natural gas interests in the permian basin which we refer to as the “gulfport properties” in exchange for shares of our common stock and a promissory note in a transaction we refer to as the gulfport transaction the gulfport transaction was treated as a business combination accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with the identifiable assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on the date of transfer see note 2—acquisitions to our audited combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding the gulfport transaction 

on october 17 2012 we completed our initial public offering or ipo of 14375000  shares of common stock which included 1875000  shares of common stock issued pursuant to the overallotment option exercised by the underwriters the stock was priced at 1750  per share and we received net proceeds of approximately 2341 million  from the sale of these shares of common stock net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 

review of exploration exploitation and development activities 

permian basin 

location and land 

we acquired approximately 4174 net acres in west texas near midland in the permian basin on december 20 2007 with an effective date of november 1 2007 from exl petroleum lp ambrose energy i ltd and certain other sellers subsequently we acquired approximately 47429 additional net acres which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to approximately 51603 net acres at december 31 2012 since our initial acquisition in the permian basin through december 31 2012 we drilled or participated in the drilling of 211 gross 184 net wells on our leasehold in this area primarily targeting the wolfberry play we are the operator of approximately 99 of our permian basin acreage the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 

area history 

our proved reserves are located in the permian basin of west texas in particular in the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations the spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s it was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central midland basin development in the spraberry play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells with economics being dependent on oil prices and drilling costs 

the wolfcamp formation is a longestablished reservoir in west texas first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties exploration using 2d seismic data located additional fields but it was not until the use of 3d seismic data in the 1990s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp formation was revealed the additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently 

during the late 1990s atlantic richfield company or arco began a drilling program targeting the base of the spraberry formation at 10000 feet with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper portion of the wolfcamp formation henry petroleum a private firm owned interests in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties while drilling in the same area as the arco project henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slickwater fracturing treatments across the entire wolfcamp interval in 2005 former members of henry petroleum’s wolfcamp team formed their own private company exl petroleum and began replicating henry petroleum’s program after exl had drilled 32 productive wolfcampspraberry wells through late 2007 they monetized a portion of their acreage position which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to the oil and gas industry by mid2010 approximately half of the rigs active in the permian basin were drilling wells in the wolfberry play as of december 31 2012 we held interests in 225 gross 201 net producing wells 

geology 

the permian basin formed as an area of rapid mississippianpennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the ouachita fold belt it is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the us and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs from permian through ordovician in age the term “wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production from the permian spraberry dean and wolfcamp formations in this report we refer to the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations collectively as the wolfberry play the wolfberry play of the midland basin lies in the area where the historically productive spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of the emerging wolfcamp play the spraberry was deposited as turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment while the wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debrisflow and grainflow sediments which were also deposited in a submarine fan setting the best carbonate reservoirs within the wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the central basin platform while the shale reservoirs within the wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the central basin platform both the spraberry and wolfcamp contain organicrich mudstones and shales which when buried to sufficient depth for maturation became the source of the hydrocarbons found in the reservoirs 

the wolfberry play can be generally characterized as a combination of lowpermeability clastic carbonate and shale reservoirs which are hydrocarboncharged and are economic due to the overall thickness of the section more than 3000 feet and application of enhanced stimulation fracking techniques the wolfberry is an unconventional “basincentered oil” resource play in the sense that there is no regional downdip oilwater contact 

several shale intervals within the wolfcamp formation are currently being evaluated for horizontal development potential and initial drilling to explore these intervals commenced in 2012 the shales exhibit microdarcy permeabilities which result in relatively small drainage areas and recovery factors because of this we believe the horizontal exploitation of these reservoirs will supplement and not replace our vertical development program 

there are also productive carbonate and shale intervals within the shallower permian clearfork formation two shale intervals within the clearfork formation are currently being evaluated for potential horizontal development below the wolfcamp formation lie the pennsylvanian strawn and atoka formations although difficult to predict there are conventional pay intervals that develop locally within these formations which when present can add significant reserves 

debris flows within the spraberry and wolfcamp carbonates have been observed on 3d seismic surveys initial tests have confirmed the presence of enhanced reservoir additionally structural closures have been mapped and are being evaluated for drilling to test deeper targets our extensive geophysical database which includes approximately 182 square miles of proprietary 3d seismic data will be used to enhance grading of future locations 

production status 

during the year ended december 31 2012 net production from our permian basin acreage was 1078321 boe or an average of 2946 boed of which 70 was oil 17 was natural gas liquids and 13 was natural gas 

facilities 

our land oil and gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the permian basin our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries oilgaswater separation equipment and pumping units 

future activity 

during 2013 we expect to drill an estimated 37 gross 31 net vertical wells and 25 gross 22 net horizontal wells on our acreage we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2013 will be between 270 million and 300 million which includes costs for infrastructure and nonoperated wells but does not include the cost of any land acquisitions 

oil and gas data 

proved reserves 

sec rulemaking activity 

in december 2008 the securities and exchange commission or the sec released its final rule for “modernization of oil and gas reporting” these rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area using the arithmetic 12month average beginningofthemonth price for the year as opposed to yearend prices as had previously been required unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used other significant amendments included the following 

 we adopted the rules effective december 31 2009 as required by the sec 

evaluation and review of reserves 

our historical reserve estimates were prepared by ryder scott as of december 31 2012 and 2011 and by pinnacle energy services llc or pinnacle as of december 31 2010 in each case with respect to our assets in the permian basin 

each of ryder scott and pinnacle is an independent petroleum engineering firm the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers neither independent thirdparty engineering firm owns an interest in any of our properties or is employed by us on a contingent basis 

under sec rules proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation if deterministic methods are used the sec has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered” all of our 2012 proved reserves were estimated using a deterministic method the estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations the first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under sec rules the process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures these analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods 1 performancebased methods 2 volumetricbased methods and 3 analogy these methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves the proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods analogy or a combination of both methods approximately 85 of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods these performance methods include but may not be limited to decline 

curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data the remaining 15 of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance and analogy methods the analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate all proved developed nonproducing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 

to estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows ryder scott considered many factors and assumptions including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly economic criteria based on current costs and the sec pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data downhole completion information geologic data electrical logs radioactivity logs core analyses available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data 

we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the permian basin our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process we provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs our vice president—reservoir engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates our vice president—reservoir engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 26 years of industry experience per person our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest oil and gas production well test data commodity prices and operating and development costs 

the preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures these procedures which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations include the following 

  

 

  

the following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves and the present value of our reserves as of december 31 2012 and 2011 based on the reserve report prepared by ryder scott and as of december 31 2010 based on the reserve report prepared by pinnacle each an independent petroleum engineering firm and such reserve reports have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec all our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in north america ryder scott and pinnacle prepared all our reserve estimates as of the periods covered by their respective reports 

  





the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs see item 1a“ risk factors  ” we have not filed any estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 

proved undeveloped reserves puds 

as of december 31 2012 our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 19008 mbbls of oil 21705 mmcf of natural gas and 5251 mbbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 27877 mboe puds will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production 

changes in puds that occurred during 2012 were primarily due to 

 costs incurred relating to the development of puds were approximately 502 million during 2012 estimated future development costs relating to the development of puds are projected to be approximately 1368 million in 2013 1320 million in 2014 1548 million in 2015 979 million in 2016 and 200 million in 2017 since our current executive team assumed management control in 2011 our average drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced as we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert puds into proved developed reserves in upcoming years 

all of our pud drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2017 

as of december 31 2012 12 of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed nonproducing 

oil and gas production prices and production costs 

production and price history 

the following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids all of which is from the permian basin in west texas and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated 

  





productive wells 

as of december 31 2012 we owned an average 870 working interest in 225 gross 201 net productive wells productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells 

  

acreage 

the following table sets forth information as of december 31 2012 relating to our leasehold acreage 

  





undeveloped acreage expirations 

many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production the following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2012 that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates 

  



drilling results 

the following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells completed during the periods indicated each of these wells was drilled in the permian basin of west texas the information should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons whether or not they produce a reasonable rate of return 



as of december 31 2012 we had 19 gross 153 net wells in the process of drilling completing or dewatering or shut in awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table 

title to properties 

as is customary in the oil and gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 

marketing and customers 

we market the majority of the oil and natural gas production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties we sell our natural gas production to purchasers at market prices in march 2009 we entered into an agreement with windsor midstream llc or midstream an entity controlled by wexford our equity sponsor during 2010 and 2011 midstream purchased a significant portion of our oil volumes effective december 1 2011 we ceased all sales of our production under this agreement and effective january 1 2012 the agreement was canceled we sell all of our natural gas under contracts with terms of greater than twelve months and all of our oil under contracts with terms of twelve months or less excluding a five year oil purchase agreement with shell trading us company or shell trading described below 

we normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in the exploration development and production business for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 one purchaser midstream accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue in both periods no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed however based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers 

on may 24 2012 we entered into an oil purchase agreement with shell trading in which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to shell trading we are obligated to commence delivery of our oil to shell trading upon completion of the reversal of the longhorn pipeline and its conversion for oil shipment which we refer to as the completion date which is currently anticipated to occur during the third quarter of 2013 although earlier delivery into the pipeline is anticipated as the pipeline commences line fill and start up operations our agreement with shell trading has an initial term of five years from the completion date each party has the right to terminate the agreement by written notice to the other party without any obligations to the other party in the event that the completion date does not occur by january 15 2014 the agreement may also be terminated by shell trading by written notice to us in the event that shell trading’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated 

our delivery obligation under this agreement is 5000 barrels per day from the service commencement date to march 31 2013 6000 barrels per day from april 1 2013 to september 30 2013 and 8000 barrels per day during the remainder of the term of the agreement we have a onetime right to elect to decrease the contract quantity by not more than 20 of the thencurrent quantity which decreased contract quantity will be effective for the remainder of the term of the agreement shell trading has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “light sweet crude oil” prompt month future contracts reported by the new york mercantile exchange over the onemonth period as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in the agreement if we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement during any threemonth period following the service commencement date we have agreed to pay shell trading a deficiency payment 

which is calculated by multiplying i the volume of oil that we failed to deliver as required under the agreement during such period by ii magellan’s longhorn spot tariff rate in effect for transportation from crane texas to the houston ship channel for the period of time for which such deficiency volume is calculated 

competition 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties further oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

transportation 

during the initial development of our fields we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems the oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm where it is further transported by pipeline our natural gas is generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through our gathering system 

oil and natural gas leases 

the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 1875 to 2500 resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 8125 to 7500 

seasonal nature of business 

generally demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations 

regulation 

oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability 

environmental matters and regulation 

our oil and natural gas exploration development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection numerous governmental agencies such as the us environmental protection agency or the epa issue regulations which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative civil 

and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for noncompliance these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands ecologically sensitive and other protected areas require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities the strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements this trend however may not continue in the future 

waste handling  the resource conservation and recovery act as amended or rcra and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder affect oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation transportation treatment storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes with federal approval the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements although most wastes associated with the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions however we cannot assure you that the epa or state or local governments will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation indeed legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes” any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 

administrative civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling and that we hold all necessary and uptodate permits registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes as presently classified to be significant any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 

remediation of hazardous substances  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act as amended also known as cercla or the “superfund” law and analogous state laws generally imposes strict and joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility under cercla and comparable state statutes persons deemed “responsible parties” may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of our operations we use materials that if released would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes therefore governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released 

water discharges  the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the “clean water act” the safe drinking water act the oil pollution act or opa and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes into navigable waters of the united states as well as state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also 

prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters including jurisdictional wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit spill prevention control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill rupture or leak these laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges in addition on october 20 2011 the epa announced a schedule to develop pretreatment standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from underground coalbed and shale formations the epa stated that it will gather data consult with stakeholders including ongoing consultation with industry and solicit public comment on a proposed rule for coalbed methane in 2013 and a proposed rule for shale gas in 2014 costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 

the oil pollution act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability the opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release including but not limited to the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 

  

noncompliance with the clean water act or opa may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive obligations we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 

air emissions  the federal clean air act as amended and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance for example on april 17 2012 the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations which regulations are discussed in more detail below in “  —regulation of hydraulic fracturing ” these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 

climate change  many nations have agreed to limit emissions of “greenhouse gases” pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the “kyoto protocol” methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of the burning of oil natural gas and refined petroleum products are “greenhouse gases” or ghgs regulated by the kyoto protocol although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol at this time several states or geographic regions have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs additionally on april 2 2007 the us supreme court ruled in   massachusetts et al v epa   that the epa has the authority to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide from automobiles as an “air pollutant” under the federal clean air act thereafter in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities the epa finalized the motor vehicle rule which purports to limit emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles manufactured in model years 20122016 in april 2010 and it became effective in january 2011 although it does not require immediate reductions in ghg emissions a recent rulemaking proposal by the epa and the department of transportation’s national highway traffic safety administration seeks to expand the motor vehicle rule to include 

vehicles manufactured in model years 20172025 the epa adopted the stationary source rule also known as the “tailoring rule” in may 2010 and it also became effective in january 2011 although it remains subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups the tailoring rule establishes new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration or psd and title v programs of the clean air act the permitting requirements of the psd program apply only to newly constructed or modified major sources obtaining a psd permit requires a source to install best available control technology or bact for those regulated pollutants that are emitted in certain quantities phase i of the tailoring rule which became effective on january 2 2011 requires projects already triggering psd permitting that are also increasing ghg emissions by more than 75000 tons per year to comply with bact rules for their ghg emissions phase ii of the tailoring rule which became effective on july 1 2011 requires preconstruction permits using bact for new projects that emit 100000 tons of ghg emissions per year or existing facilities that make major modifications increasing ghg emissions by more than 75000 tons per year phase iii of the tailoring rule which is expected to go into effect in 2013 will seek to streamline the permitting process and permanently exclude smaller sources from the permitting process additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gasdistribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in november 2010 the epa expanded its existing ghg reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing transmission storage and distribution facilities which may include certain of our facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 in addition the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries such as the march 2012 proposed ghg rule restricting future development of coalfired power plants the proposed rule underwent an extended public comment process which concluded on june 25 2012 the epa is also under a legal obligation pursuant to a consent decree with certain environmental groups to issue new source performance standards for refineries the epa has also adopted regulations imposing best available control technology requirements on the largest greenhouse gas stationary sources regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities and it is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as “air pollutants” as a result of this continued regulatory focus future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility 

in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of ghgs the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of such allowances is expected to escalate significantly 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry currently while we are subject to certain federal ghg monitoring and reporting requirements our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives and at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing ghg emissions would impact our business 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

regulation of hydraulic fracturing 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production the federal safe drinking water act or sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control or uic program hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the uic program and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions the epa 

however has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program specifically as “class ii” uic wells at the same time the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration–wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities moreover the epa announced on october 20 2011 that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant as part of these studies the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process these studies depending on their results could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 

legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress the us congress continues to consider legislation to amend the sdwa 

on april 17 2012 the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds  or vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january 1 2015 compliance with such rules could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

in addition there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing’s potential impacts the results of which are expected between later in 2013 and 2014 these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities the us department of energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulicfracturing completion methods additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the sec to investigate the naturalgas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 

several states including texas and the department of the interior in a may 4 2012 proposed rule covering federal lands have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids on may 31 2011 the texas legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process it was signed into law on june 17 2011 effective as of september 1 2011 the texas railroad commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that will apply to all wells for which the railroad commission issues an initial drilling permit on or after february 1 2012 the new law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the texas railroad commission with the well completion report the total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the texas railroad commission 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to 

stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing 

other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal state and local authorities legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion frequently increasing the regulatory burden also numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types quantities and locations of production 

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed what proposals if any might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any the proposals might have on our operations sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 

drilling and production  our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local level these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells drilling bonds and reports concerning operations the state and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following 

 state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in some instances forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill moreover each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be 

produced from our wells negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 

federal state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate the us army corps of engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment decommissioning and site restoration although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 

natural gas sales and transportation  historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 and the natural gas policy act of 1978 since 1978 various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales” which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 

ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 

under ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or at marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters although its policy is still in flux ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to pointofsale locations 

oil sales and transportation  sales of crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future 

our crude oil sales are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

further interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis under this open access standard common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates when oil pipelines operate at full capacity access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs accordingly we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 

state regulation  texas regulates the drilling for and the production gathering and sale of oil and natural gas including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits texas currently imposes a 46 severance tax on oil production and a 75 severance tax on natural gas production states also regulate the method of developing new fields the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources states may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from 

oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation or both states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 

the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal state and local regulations and laws some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 

operational hazards and insurance 

the oil business involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blow outs pipe failures and in some cases abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases if any of these should occur we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury loss of life damage or destruction to property natural resources and equipment pollution or environmental damage regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 

in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed we currently have insurance policies for onshore property oil lease propertyproduction equipment for selected locations rig physical damage protection control of well protection for selected wells comprehensive general liability commercial automobile workers compensation pollution liability claims made coverage with a policy retroactive date excess umbrella liability and other coverage 

our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences damages and losses any of these operational hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows see “item 1a risk factors–risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business–operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits” 

we reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy terms and limits annually future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations which might severely impact our financial position the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

generally we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 52 full time employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements we also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land technical regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees 

facilities 

our corporate headquarters is located in midland texas we also lease additional office space in midland and in oklahoma city oklahoma we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks the following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to our business activities other risks are described in “item 1 business” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” these risks are not the only risks we face 

risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business 

our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history 

diamondback energy inc was incorporated in delaware on december 30 2011 prior to october 11 2012 all of our historical oil and natural gas assets operations and results described in this report were those of windsor permian which prior to our initial public offering was an entity controlled by our equity sponsor wexford immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering windsor permian became our whollyowned subsidiary and we acquired the oil and gas assets of gulfport located in the permian basin in the gulfport transaction the oil and natural gas properties described in this report have been acquired by windsor permian gulfport and windsor ut since december 2007 as a result there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance 

we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as a recentlyformed company growth in accordance with our business plan if achieved could place a significant strain on our financial technical operational and management resources as we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate there will be additional demands on our financial technical operational and management resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers geologists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan 

approximately 84 of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and therefore our future cash flow and income 

approximately 84 of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves in addition many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells we could lose our rights under such leases our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage 

our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves in 2012 our total capital expenditures including expenditures for leasehold interests and property acquisitions drilling seismic and infrastructure were approximately 1118 million  our 2013 capital budget for drilling completion and infrastructure including investments in water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects is estimated to be approximately 2700 million to 3000 million to date we have financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from wexford our equity sponsor borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash generated by operations and the net proceeds of our initial public offering however neither wexford nor any of its affiliates has made any commitment to provide us additional funding notwithstanding prior contributions and loans to us by wexford or its affiliates you should not assume that any of them will provide any debt or equity funding to us in the future 

in the near term we intend to finance our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 

we cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures further our actual capital expenditures in 2013 could exceed our capital expenditure budget in the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available we could be required to seek additional sources of capital which may include traditional reserve base borrowings debt financing joint venture partnerships production payment financings sales of assets offerings of debt or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 

if we are unable to fund our capital requirements we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan complete acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production revenues and results of operations in addition a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings 

our success depends on finding developing or acquiring additional reserves 

our future success depends upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves or both to increase reserves and production we undertake development exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development production exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration development production or other replacement activities such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs furthermore although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 

our project areas which are in various stages of development may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 

our project areas are in various stages of development ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history from inception through december 31 2012 we drilled a total of 193 gross wells and participated in an additional 18 gross nonoperated wells of which 191 wells were completed as producing wells and 20 wells were in various stages of completion if the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future our business may be materially affected 

our identified potential drilling locations which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 

as of december 31 2012 we had 881 identified potential vertical drilling locations on our existing acreage based on 40acre spacing and an additional 1118 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20acre downspacing we have also identified 731 potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage only 306 of these identified potential vertical drilling locations and four of these identified potential horizontal drilling locations were attributed to proved reserves these drilling locations including those without proved undeveloped reserves represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including the availability of capital construction of infrastructure inclement weather regulatory changes and approvals oil and natural gas prices costs and drilling 

results further our identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation we cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable or whether wells drilled on 20acre downspacing will produce at the same rates as those on 40acre spacing the use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations further initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the permian basin may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates because of these uncertainties we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration generally within three to five years in order to hold the acreage by production in a highly competitive market for acreage failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost or if renewal is not feasible loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 

leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years after which they expire unless prior to expiration production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres as of december 31 2012 we had leases representing 581 net acres expiring in 2013 2157 net acres expiring in 2014 17826 net acres expiring in 2015 6893 net acres expiring in 2016 and 1820 net acres expiring in 2017 the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all any reduction in our current drilling program either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2014 and 2015 we will need to operate at least a fourrig program we cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame or that commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program any such losses of leases could materially and adversely affect the growth of our asset basis cash flows and results of operations 

the volatility of oil and natural gas prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our profitability 

our revenues operating results profitability future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas historically oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control including 

 

 these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty for example during the past five years the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil which we refer to as west texas intermediate or wti has ranged from a low of 3028 per barrel or bbl in december 2008 to a high of 14531 per bbl in july 2008 the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of 182 per million british thermal units or mmbtu in april 2012 to a high of 1331 per mmbtu in july 2008 during 2012 west texas intermediate prices ranged from 7772 to 10939 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 182 to 377 per mmbtu on december 31 2012 the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was 9183 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 343 per mmbtu any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves in addition lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development results deteriorate full cost accounting rules may require us to write down as a noncash charge to earnings the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 

we have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional price swap derivatives for a portion of our production which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on new york mercantile exchange light sweet crude oil pricing the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty for the purpose of lockingin the value of a swap we enter into counterswaps from time to time under the counterswap we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty the counterswap is effective in lockingin the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counterswap 

in december 2007 we placed a swap contract covering 1680000 bbls of crude oil for the period from january 2008 to december 2012 at various fixed prices in april 2008 we entered into a series of counterswaps to lockin the value of certain of these swaps settling 1188000 bbls of crude oil swaps in june 2009 we entered into an additional series of counterswaps to lockin the value of most of the remaining swaps settling 324000 bbls of crude oil swaps locking in the value of our swaps with counterswaps without entering into new swaps exposes us to commodity price risks on the originally swapped position as of december 31 2010 and 2009 all of our swap contracts were lockedin with counter swaps in october 2011 we placed a swap contract covering 1000 bbls per day of crude oil for the period from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 at a fixed price of 7850 per barrel for 2012 and 8055 per barrel for 2013 such contracts and any future hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase in addition these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil accordingly our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 

our hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 

our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 

the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 

in addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate approximately 60 million 

at december 31 2012 and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production approximately 81 million at december 31 2012 joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill we are generally unable to control which coowners participate in our wells 

we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 one purchaser windsor midstream llc an entity controlled by wexford our equity sponsor accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue in both periods no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods this concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions current economic circumstances may further increase these risks we do not require our customers to post collateral the inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results 

our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves the average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was 2390 2541 and 1778 for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively depreciation depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 258 million 154 million and 74 million respectively 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense beginning december 31 2009 we have used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues 

no impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we may however experience ceiling test write downs in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” for a more detailed description of our method of accounting 

our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices production levels ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect our historical estimates of proved reserves and related valuations as of december 31 2012 and 2011 are based on reports prepared by ryder scott an independent petroleum engineering firm our historical estimates of proved reserves and related valuations as of december 31 2010 are based on a report prepared by pinnacle an independent petroleum engineering firm ryder scott and pinnacle as applicable conducted a wellbywell review of all our 

properties for the periods covered by their respective reserve reports using information provided by us over time we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling testing and production also certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 

the estimates of reserves as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 included in this report were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a fieldbyfield basis on the first day of each month within the 12month periods ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in accordance with the revised sec guidelines applicable to reserves estimates for such periods reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist nor do they include any value for unproved undeveloped acreage the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 

the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 

sec rules that went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december 31 2009 could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 

sec rules that went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december 31 2009 require that subject to limited exceptions proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program moreover we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

approximately 69 of our total estimated proved reserves at december 31 2012 were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations the reserve data included in the reserve reports of our independent petroleum engineers assume that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves we cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical in addition delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves 

our producing properties are located in the permian basin of west texas making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area in addition we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area 

all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the permian basin of west texas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints availability of equipment facilities personnel or services market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil natural gas or natural gas liquids in addition the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the permian basin which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above at december 31 2012 all of our proved reserves were attributable to the wolfberry play this concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks such as changes in fieldwide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shutin all of our wells within a field 

we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production the loss of one or more of these purchasers could among other factors limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 

the availability of a ready market for any oil andor natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines the availability of skilled labor materials and equipment the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of gas sold in interstate commerce in addition we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 one purchaser windsor midstream llc an entity controlled by wexford our equity sponsor accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue in both periods no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods we cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production 

the unavailability high cost or shortages of rigs equipment raw materials supplies or personnel may restrict our operations 

the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical which can result in shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies and personnel when shortages occur the costs and delivery times of rigs equipment and supplies increase and demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand in accordance with customary industry practice we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire in addition we do not have longterm contracts securing the use of our existing rigs and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us in addition although we intend to increase the number of rigs we have operating in 2013 we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so shortages of drilling rigs equipment raw materials particularly sand and other proppants supplies personnel trucking services tubulars fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes historically we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations according to the lower colorado river authority during 2011 texas experienced the lowest inflows of water of any year in recorded history as a result of this severe drought some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

declining general economic business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

concerns over global economic conditions energy costs geopolitical issues inflation the availability and cost of credit the european debt crisis the united states mortgage market and a weak real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy these factors combined with volatile prices of oil natural gas and natural gas liquids declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession in addition continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other countries concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity 

prices if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates further worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil natural gas and natural gas liquids affect the ability of our vendors suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

we have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future 

we incurred a net loss of 365 million for the year ended december 31 2012 our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures the uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically find develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves as a result we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities in the future 

part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques therefore the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 

our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers risks that we face while drilling include but are not limited to landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore risks that we face while completing our wells include but are not limited to being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 

ultimately the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints lease expirations access to gathering systems andor declines in natural gas and oil prices the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate further as a result of any of these developments we could incur material writedowns of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced 

the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering system our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation our natural gas production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the purchaser we do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties we may be required to shut in or curtail production any such shut in or curtailment or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 

our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations drilling bonds reports concerning operations the spacing of wells unitization and pooling of properties and taxation from time to time regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas in addition the production handling storage transportation remediation emission and disposal of oil and gas byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties permit revocations requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations moreover these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue see “item 1 business—regulation—environmental matters and regulation” and “item 1 business—regulation—other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry” for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us 

federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 

hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly natural gas from tight formations including shales the process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production the federal safe drinking water act or sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control or uic program hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the uic program and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions the environmental protection agency or epa however has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program specifically as “class ii” uic wells at the same time the white house council on environmental quality is conducting an administrationwide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities moreover the epa announced on october 20 2011 that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant as part of these studies the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process these studies depending on their results could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 

legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process were proposed in recent sessions of congress the us congress continues to consider legislation to amend the sdwa 

on april 17 2012 the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations specifically the epa’s rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds or vocs and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities the final rule seeks to achieve a 95 reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulicallyfractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks and other production equipment these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january 1 2015 compliance with such rules could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

in addition there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing’s potential impacts the results of which are expected between later in 2013 and 2014 

these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities the us department of energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulicfracturing completion methods additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 

several states including texas have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances andor require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids the texas railroad commission recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal occupational safety and health act or osha to state regulators and on a public internet website also on may 4 2012 the us department of interior or doi issued a draft rule that seeks to require companies operating on federal and indian lands to i publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process ii confirm their wells meet certain construction standards and iii establish site plans to manage flowback water we plan to use hydraulic fracturing extensively in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal state local foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and gas that we can economically recover which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids impacts on drinking water supplies use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water groundwater and the environment generally a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices if new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater in addition if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements more stringent construction specifications increased monitoring reporting and recordkeeping obligations plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations at this time it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of federal state and local environmental health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these laws and regulations may among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions water discharges waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling producing and other operations ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling fracturing and completion processes iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits andor v impose substantial liabilities for spills pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens the suspension or revocation of necessary permits licenses and authorizations the requirement that 

additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations in addition the risk of accidental andor unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws moreover public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the us congress adopted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act hr 4173 which among other provisions establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the legislation was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 in its rulemaking under the legislation the commodities futures trading commission or cftc has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions the cftc’s final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september 28 2012 and remanded to the cftc to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied as a result the rule has not yet taken effect although the cftc has indicated that it intends to appeal the court’s decision and that it believes the doddfrank act requires it to impose position limits the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 

in addition the doddfrank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges rather than hedging overthecounter and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities while it is not possible at this time to predict when the cftc will finalize certain other related rules and regulations the doddfrank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our derivative activities although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels the cost of which could be passed through to us or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy the financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and tradeexecution requirements in connection with our existing or future derivative activities 

although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the legislation was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

proposed changes to us tax laws if adopted could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the us president’s fiscal year 2013 budget proposal includes provisions that would if enacted make significant changes to us tax laws these changes include but are not limited to i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs ii eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development iii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and iv implementing certain international tax reforms these proposed changes in the us tax laws if adopted or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

many nations have agreed to limit emissions of “greenhouse gases” pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change also known as the “kyoto protocol” methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of the burning of oil natural gas and refined petroleum products are “greenhouse gases” or ghgs regulated by the kyoto protocol although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol at this time several states or geographic regions have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases additionally on april 2 2007 the us supreme court ruled in massachusetts et al v epa  that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles as “air pollutant” under the federal clean air act thereafter in december 2009 the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because according to the epa emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act subsequently the epa adopted two sets of related rules one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities the epa finalized the motor vehicle rule which purports to limit emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles manufactured in model years 20122016 in april 2010 and it became effective in january 2011 although it does not require immediate reductions in ghg emissions a recent rulemaking proposal by the epa and the department of transportation’s national highway traffic safety administration seeks to expand the motor vehicle rule to include vehicles manufactured in model years 20172025 the epa adopted the stationary source rule also known as the “tailoring rule” in may 2010 and it also became effective in january 2011 although it remains subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups the tailoring rule establishes new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration or psd and title v programs of the clean air act the permitting requirements of the psd program apply only to newly constructed or modified major sources obtaining a psd permit requires a source to install best available control technology or bact for those regulated pollutants that are emitted in certain quantities phase i of the tailoring rule which became effective on january 2 2011 requires projects already triggering psd permitting that are also increasing ghg emissions by more than 75000 tons per year to comply with bact rules for their ghg emissions phase ii of the tailoring rule which became effective on july 1 2011 requires preconstruction permits using bact for new projects that emit 100000 tons of ghg emissions per year or existing facilities that make major modifications increasing ghg emissions by 

more than 75000 tons per year phase iii of the tailoring rule which is expected to go into effect in 2013 will seek to streamline the permitting process and permanently exclude smaller sources from the permitting process additionally in september 2009 the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gasdistribution companies beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in november 2010 the epa expanded its existing ghg reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing transmission storage and distribution facilities which may include certain of our facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011 in addition the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries such as the march 2012 proposed ghg rule restricting future development of coalfired power plants the proposed rule underwent an extended public comment process which concluded on june 25 2012 the epa is also under a legal obligation pursuant to a consent decree with certain environmental groups to issue new source performance standards for refineries the epa has also adopted regulations imposing best available control technology requirements on the largest greenhouse gas stationary sources regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities and it is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as “air pollutants” as a result of this continued regulatory focus future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility in addition the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 

restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry currently while we are subject to certain federal ghg monitoring and reporting requirements our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal state and local climate change initiatives and at this time it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 

in addition there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes thunderstorms tornados and snow or ice storms as well as rising sea levels another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured however at this time we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 

section 1b of the natural gas act of 1938 or the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore is exempt from ferc’s jurisdiction under the nga however the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a factbased determination the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business 

many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees the loss of their services could adversely affect our business in particular the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team including our chief executive officer travis d stice could disrupt our operations we have employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they cease to be employed by us however as a practical matter such employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees further we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees as a result we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 

a significant reduction by wexford of its ownership interest in us could adversely affect us 

prior to october 11 2012 wexford beneficially owned 100 of our equity interests upon completion of our initial public offering wexford beneficially owned approximately 444 of our common stock further several individuals who serve as our directors are affiliates of wexford we believe that wexford’s substantial ownership interest in us provides wexford with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful upon the expiration of the lockup restrictions on transfers or sales of our securities by or on behalf of db energy holdings llc or db holdings imposed in connection with our initial public offering wexford will not be subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time thereafter to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us if wexford sells all or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us wexford may have less incentive to assist in our success and its affiliates that serve as members of our board of directors may resign such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies which could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations we also receive certain services including drilling services from entities controlled by wexford these service contracts may generally be terminated on 30days notice in the event wexford ceases to own a significant ownership interest in us such services may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us if at all 

drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highrisk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our drilling activities are subject to many risks for example we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling operating and other costs the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically the costs of exploration exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project further our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed delayed canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors including 

 any of these risks can cause substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 

historically we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time however we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments additionally we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 

  

drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling operating and other costs the cost of drilling completing and operating a well is often uncertain and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions equipment failures or accidents shortages of equipment or personnel environmental issues and for other reasons in addition wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 

operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 

our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas including the risk of fire explosions blowouts surface cratering uncontrollable flows of natural gas oil and formation water pipe or pipeline failures abnormally pressured formations casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases in addition our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing including any mishandling surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids including chemical additives the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 

we endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with services and goods which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing drilling and cementing services and tubular goods for surface intermediate and production casing under our agreements with our vendors to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties i our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and ii we generally assume the responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations including preexisting pollution and pollution which may result from fire blowout cratering seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of oil gas or other substances as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids in addition we generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendorowned property that occurs in the well hole except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage rather than day work basis or as a result of the use of equipment certain corrosive fluids additives chemicals or proppants however despite this general allocation of risk we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk as a result we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice we historically have maintained insurance against some but not all of our business risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer also insurance may no longer be available to us or if it is its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow in addition we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations this may cause us to restrict our operations 

which might severely impact our financial position we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 

since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury property damage and cleanup costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event however we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy we have no coverage for gradual longterm pollution events in addition these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to successfully identify complete and integrate future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 

there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon among other things our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and in some cases regulatory approvals further these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations personnel and facilities in addition if we enter into new geographic markets we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such additional legal requirements completed acquisitions could require us to invest further in operational financial and management information systems and to attract retain motivate and effectively manage additional employees the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations which in turn could negatively impact our earnings and growth our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 

properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 

acquiring oil and gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not inspect every well or pipeline we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as pipe corrosion when an inspection is made we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

it is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest rather we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest 

prior to the drilling of an oil or gas well however it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well frequently as a result of such examinations certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title and such curative work entails expense our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves additionally undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest we will suffer a financial loss 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than us many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal state local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 

our use of 2d and 3d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 

even when properly used and interpreted 2d and 3d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures in addition the use of 3d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 

we will be subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we are unable to timely comply with section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant our profitability stock price and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we will be required to comply with certain provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as of december 31 2013 section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting this section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls if and when we become a large accelerated filer as defined in the sec rules or if we otherwise cease to qualify for an exemption from the requirement to provide auditors’ attestation on internal controls afforded to emerging growth companies under the “jumpstart our business startups act” enacted by the us congress in april 2012 we are currently evaluating our existing controls against the standards adopted by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission during the course of our ongoing evaluation and integration of our internal control over financial reporting we may identify areas requiring improvement and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review 

we believe that the outofpocket costs the diversion of management’s attention from running the daytoday operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could be significant if the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we cannot be certain at this time that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures certification and attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or that we or our auditors will not identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting if we fail to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act or if we or our auditors identify and report such material weaknesses the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock in addition a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business 

our business and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability terms and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our access to capital limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations we require continued access to capital a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results 

we recorded compensation expense in 2012 and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the foreseeable future 

as a result of outstanding stockbased compensation awards we recorded 63 million of compensation expense in 2012 in addition our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses because of the costs associated with our existing and possible future incentive plans these additional expenses could adversely affect our net income the future expense will be dependent upon the number of sharebased awards issued and the fair value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant however they may be significant we will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period of awards made to recipients 

our level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility 

in the future we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties 

our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways including the following 

 a high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance general economic conditions oil and natural gas prices and financial business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance many of these factors are beyond our control we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 

our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 

our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 in addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests the requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable obtain future financing fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business 

if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility there could be an event of default under the terms of our revolving credit facility which could result in an acceleration of repayment 

if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility there could be an event of default under the terms of this facility our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants including meeting the financial ratios and tests under our revolving credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control as a result we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial ratios and tests in the event of a default under our revolving credit facility the lenders under such facility could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable if any of these events occur our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing even if we could obtain alternative financing it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us additionally we may not be able to amend our revolving credit facility or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms 

our borrowings under our revolving credit facility expose us to interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility which bear interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime libor or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 125 to 350 depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base as of october 17 2012 the last date in 2012 on which we had borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility the weighted average interest rate on such borrowings was 372 if interest rates increase so will our interest costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations 

under our revolving credit facility which currently provides for a 1350 million borrowing base we are subject to semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation and cash flow 

loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 

we are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs including our well operations information seismic data electronic data processing and accounting data if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure possible consequences include our loss of communication links inability to find produce process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 

terrorist activities antiterrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations if any of these events occur the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or damaged costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain if available at all 

risks related to our common stock 

our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders 

upon completion of our initial public offering wexford and gulfport beneficially owned approximately 444 and 214 respectively of our common stock in addition individuals affiliated with wexford and gulfport serve on our board of directors and gulfport has the right to designate one individual as a nominee for election to our board of directors so long as it continues to beneficially own more than 10 of our outstanding common stock as a result wexford and gulfport together are able to control and wexford alone will continue to be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business the interests of wexford and gulfport with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us such as future acquisitions financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders this continued concentrated ownership will make it impossible for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares unless wexford approves the acquisition 

the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable wexford our equity sponsor or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us 

subject to the limitations of applicable law our certificate of incorporation among other things 

 these provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates 

we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests 

we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies these transactions include among others drilling services provided to us by bison drilling and field services llc real property leased by us from fasken midland llc and certain administrative services provided to us by everest operations management llc each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with wexford and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts for a discussion of potential conflicts see “—risks related to our common stock – our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders” 

we incur increased costs as a result of being a public company which may significantly affect our financial condition 

we completed our initial public offering in october 2012 as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company we also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as rules implemented by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly and we expect that these costs may increase further after we are no longer an “emerging growth company” these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 

however for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” 

we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years although if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 700 million as of any june 30 before that time we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of the following december 31 

after we are no longer an “emerging growth company” we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act see “ —risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—we will be subject to certain requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if we are unable to timely comply with section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant our profitability stock price and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected ” 

we are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

under the jumpstart our business startups act “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” 

if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly your investment could lose value 

although our common stock is listed on the nasdaq select global market we cannot assure you that an active public market will develop or continue for our common stock if an active public market for our common stock does not develop or continue the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected if there is a thin trading market or “float” for our stock the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole without a large float our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and as a result the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile in addition in the absence of an active public trading market investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us furthermore the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors including 

 the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies including companies in our industry the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

future sales of our common stock or the perception that such future sales may occur may cause our stock price to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock all of the shares sold in our initial public offering except for any shares purchased by our affiliates are freely tradable db holdings gulfport and our directors and executive officers are subject to agreements that limit their ability to sell our common stock held by them these holders cannot sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock for a period of at least 180 days after our initial public offering which period may be extended under limited circumstances without the prior written approval of credit suisse securities usa llc however these lockup agreements are subject to certain specific exceptions including transfers of common stock as a bona fide gift or by will or intestate succession and transfers to such person’s immediate family or to a trust or to an entity controlled by such holder provided that the recipient of the shares agrees to be bound by the same restrictions on sales we have also granted db holdings and gulfport certain registration rights obligating us to register with the sec their shares of our common stock in the event that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the market perceives that such sales may occur the price of our stock could decline 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company 

or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline 

we may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 

provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult including 

 these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions as a result these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders 

we currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition results of operations contractual restrictions capital requirements business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors in addition the terms of our credit facilities prohibit us from paying dividends and making other distributions as a result only appreciation of the price of our common stock which may not occur will provide a return to our stockholders

overview 

we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition development exploration and exploitation of unconventional longlife onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas our activities are primarily directed at the clearfork spraberry wolfcamp cline strawn and atoka formations which we refer to as the wolfberry play we intend to grow our reserves and production through development drilling exploitation and exploration activities on our multiyear inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives targeting oilweighted reserves substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production our production was approximately 70 oil 17 natural gas liquids and 13 natural gas for the year ended december 31 2012  and was approximately 74 oil 14 natural gas liquids and 12 natural gas for the year ended december 31 2011  on december 31 2012  our net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 51603 net acres 

diamondback was incorporated in delaware on december 30 2011 and did not conduct any material business operations until october 11 2012 when diamondback merged with its parent entity diamondback energy llc with diamondback continuing as the surviving entity diamondback energy llc was a holding company and did not conduct any material business operations other than its ownership of our common stock and the membership interests in windsor permian llc or windsor permian as a result of the merger windsor permian became a whollyowned subsidiary of diamondback also on october 11 2012 wexford our equity sponsor caused all of the outstanding equity interests in windsor ut llc or windsor ut to be contributed to windsor permian prior to the merger in a transaction we refer to as the “windsor ut contribution” the windsor ut contribution was treated as a combination of entities under common control with assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in a manner similar to a pooling of interests we refer to the historical results of windsor permian and windsor ut prior to october 11 2012 as our “predecessors” 

also on october 11 2012 we acquired all of the oil and natural gas properties of gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for i 7914036 shares of our common stock ii approximately 636 million in the form of a noninterest bearing promissory note that was repaid in full upon the closing of our initial public offering and iii a postclosing cash adjustment of approximately 186 million we are the operator of the acreage acquired by us from gulfport 

  

on october 17 2012 we completed our initial public offering of 12500000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 1750 per share on october 23 2012 the underwriters purchased an additional 1875000 shares of our common stock following the exercise in full of their overallotment option we received net proceeds of approximately 2341 million from the sale of these shares of common stock net of estimated offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 

basis of presentation 

transfers of a business between entities under common control are accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period and prior years are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information as discussed above the windsor ut contribution was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control accordingly the financial information and production and reserve data contained herein have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of windsor ut at historical carrying values and its operations as if it was combined for all periods presented 

in june 2012 windsor permian distributed to its sole member its minority equity interests in bison drilling and field services llc or bison and a 33 interest in muskie holdings llc or muskie so we could focus our activities on our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities bison was formed in november 2010 as a whollyowned subsidiary of windsor permian beginning on march 31 2011 various related party investors contributed capital to bison diluting our ownership interest to approximately 22 we assessed our ability to exercise financial control over bison and based on the results of the assessment we concluded that we maintained significant influence but we no longer had the ability to exercise control over bison we deconsolidated bison for financial reporting purposes as of march 31 2011 and the previously consolidated amounts were removed from the combined consolidated balance sheet and reflected as an equity method investment we eliminated intercompany profits or losses in relation to our continuing involvement with bison proportionate to our equity interest under the equity method generally our share of investees’ earnings or loss is recognized in the combined consolidated statements of operations however because substantially all of bison’s earnings were generated by performing services on properties owned and operated by us our share of bison’s earnings have been credited to oil and gas properties we recorded revenues of 15 million attributable to bison in our combined consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2011 muskie was formed in 2011 and owns certain assets real estate and rights in a lease for land that is prospective for oil and natural gas fracture grade sand we recorded a loss from equity method investments of 7000 for 2011 the interests in bison and muskie are reflected in “investmentsequity method” on our combined consolidated balance sheets for additional information regarding bison and muskie see note 5—equity method investments to our combined consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 

since we began operations in 2007 we have increased our drilling activity evaluated potential acquisitions and added to our acreage portfolio because of our growth through acquisitions and development of our properties our historical results of operations and periodtoperiod comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 

operating results overview 

during the year ended december 31 2012 our average daily production was approximately 2946 boe consisting of 2066 bblsd of oil 2277 mcfd of natural gas and 500 bblsd of natural gas liquids an increase of 78 or 1288 boed from average daily production of 1658 boed for the year ended december 31 2011  consisting of 1231 bblsd of oil 1133 mcfd of natural gas and 238 bblsd of natural gas liquids 

during the year ended december 31 2012  we drilled 57 gross 41 net wells and participated in an additional eight gross three net nonoperated wells in the permian basin 

reserves and pricing 

in the table below ryder scott estimated all of our proved reserves at december 31 2012  and 2011  pinnacle estimated all of our proved reserves at december 31 2010 the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality transportation fees geographical differentials marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead 





sources of our revenue 

our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  our revenues were derived 88 and 84 respectively from oil sales 9 and 10 respectively from natural gas liquids sales 3 and 3 respectively from natural gas sales and none and 3 respectively from oil and natural gas services our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile during 2012 west texas intermediate posted prices ranged from 7772 to 10939 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from 182 to 377 per mmbtu on december 31 2012 the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was 9183 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was 343 per mmbtu 

to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices from timetotime we enter into derivative arrangements for our crude oil and natural gas production we utilize commodity derivatives to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in nymex wti and brent crude benchmark prices while these derivative contracts stabilize our cash flows when market prices are below our contract prices they also prevent us from realizing increases in our cash flow when market prices are higher than our contract prices we will sustain realized and unrealized losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and conversely we will sustain realized and unrealized gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices our derivatives contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and as a result gains or losses on derivatives contracts are recorded as other income expense in our statements of operations for the yearend status of our derivatives see note 11—derivatives and for derivative contracts entered into subsequent to december 31 2012 see note 14—subsequent events in the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

principal components of our cost structure 

lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses  these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties such costs also include maintenance repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 

production taxes  production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities where available we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties 

general and administrative  these are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations franchise taxes audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance 

depreciation depletion and amortization  under the full cost accounting method we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities we calculate depletion on the following types of costs i all capitalized costs other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned less accumulated amortization ii the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves and iii the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from three to fifteen years 

impairment expense  this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value 

other income expense 

interest income  this represents the interest received on our cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense  we finance a portion of our working capital requirements capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our credit facility we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations 

in interest rates and our financing decisions we reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense in addition we include the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense 

gainloss on derivative instruments  we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil this amount represents i the recognition of unrealized gains and losses associated with our open derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into and ii our realized gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments 

loss from equity investment  this line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our investment in the membership interests of muskie an equity method investment 

income tax expense  prior our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes at the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000  

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated 



1 after giving effect to our hedging arrangements the average prices per bbl of oil and per boe were 7968 and 6447 respectively during the year ended december 31 2012  and 9215 and 7905 respectively during the year ended december 31 2011  average prices for our hydrocarbons were not impacted by our hedging arrangements during 2010 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 27087000 or 57 to 74962000 for the year ended december 31 2012  from 47875000 for the year ended december 31 2011  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 1288 boed during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  the total increase in revenue of approximately 27087000 is largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and the effect of the contribution of gulfport’s permian basin assets during the period october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 the revenue increase attributable to the contribution of assets from gulfport during the period october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 was 7353000 our production increased by 306852 bbls of oil 96299 bbls of natural gas liquids and 419876 mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately 8183000 calculated as the change in periodtoperiod average prices times current period production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 35270000 calculated as the increase in periodtoperiod volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas times the period average prices are shown below 



lease operating expense  lease operating expense was 16793000 1557 per boe for the year ended december 31 2012  an increase of 6196000 or 58 from 10597000 1751 per boe for the year ended december 31 2011  the increase is due to increased drilling activity which resulted in additional producing wells for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  our lease operating expense during both periods was also adversely impacted by the cost of processing and treating nonhydrocarbon gases from certain of our wells that came online in 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed construction of both oil and water gathering systems that will transport this gas stream to a sour gas pipeline thereby eliminating the monthly processing and treating expense and reducing water trucking respectively in addition in the first quarter 2013 we moved a portion of our produced water to pipe connected to a commercial salt water disposal well we believe that the completion of the gathering systems the connection to a salt water disposal well and other actions will help reduce our lease operating expense in future periods 

production tax expense  production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales was 49 for both the year ended december 31 2012  and 2011  production taxes are primarily based on the market value of our production at the wellhead and may vary across the different counties in which we operate total production taxes increased 1325000 from 2366000 during the year ended december 31 2011  to 3691000 during the year ended december 31 2012  as a result of higher production and an increase in the market value of our production 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization expense increased 10672000 or 68 from 15601000 for the year ended december 31 2011  to 26273000 for the year ended december 31 2012  this increase was due to an increase in our full cost pool as a result of our acquisitions and capital spending the average depletion rate was 2436 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2578 for the year ended december 31 2011 the average depletion rate includes oil and gas depletion and other property and equipment depreciation the decrease in depletion rate was due to an increase in proved reserves at december 31 2012 

general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense increased 6721000 from 3655000 for the year ended december 31 2011  to 10376000 for the year ended december 31 2012  the increase was due to increases in salary legal professional service and contract labor expenses these increases were partially offset by increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity in connection with our initial public offering we incurred a nonrecurring charge to our fourth quarter general and administrative expense of approximately 27 million for executive bonuses and noncash equity based compensation expense associated with such offering 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012  was 3607000 as compared to 2517000 for the year ended december 31 2011  an increase of 1090000 this increase is due primarily to an increase in our weighted average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement to 77489000 for the year ended december 31 2012  from 68409000 for the same period in 2011 

derivatives  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the realized and unrealized changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments” for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a realized loss on settlement of derivative instruments of 5440000 and 37000 respectively for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we had an unrealized gain on open derivative instruments of 8057000 and an unrealized loss of 12972000 respectively 

income tax expense  prior to our initial public offering in october 2012 the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut as limited liability companies were not subject to federal income taxes as of october 11 2012 the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback’s assets and liabilities this charge was 54142000  for the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a deferred income tax expense of 54903000 income tax expense of 761000 was incurred as a result of operations from october 11 2012 through december 31 2012 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues  our oil natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately 21433000  or 81 to 47875000  for the year ended december 31 2011  from 26442000  for the year ended december 31 2010  our revenues are a function of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes average daily production sold increased by 522 boed during the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  the total increase in revenue of approximately 21433000  is largely attributable to higher oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes and an increase in the prices of oil and natural gas liquids realized for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  production increased by 168713 bbls of oil 6837 bbls of natural gas liquids and 89793 mcf of natural gas for the year ended 2011  as compared to the year ended 2010  the net dollar effect of the increase in prices of approximately 7832000 calculated as the change in yeartoyear average prices times current year production volumes of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately 13601000 calculated as the increase in yeartoyear volumes for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas times the prior year average prices are shown below 



lease operating expense  lease operating expense was 10597000  1751 per boe for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 6008000  or 131 from 4589000  1107 per boe for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase is due to increased drilling activity which resulted in additional producing wells for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 on a perboe basis the increase is due to cost increases in services and supplies primarily as a result of higher demand for such services and supplies in the permian basin and higher commodity prices the cost of repairing and replacing downhole equipment due to rod and tubing configurations and pumping practices that resulted in a higher rate of well failures during 2011 and the associated downtime and loss of production as these failures were remediated our lease operating expense for the year ended december 31 2011 was also adversely impacted by the cost of processing and treating nonhydrocarbon gases from certain of our wells that came on line in 2011 

production tax expense  production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 49 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 51 for the year ended december 31 2010 production taxes are primarily based on the market value of our production at the wellhead and vary across the different counties in which we operate total production taxes increased 1019000  or 76 from 1347000  during the year ended 

december 31 2010 to 2366000  during the year ended december 31 2011 as a result of higher production and an increase in the market value of our production 

depreciation depletion and amortization  depreciation depletion and amortization expense increased 7456000  or 92 from 8145000  for the year ended december 31 2010 to 15601000  for the year ended december 31 2011 the average depletion rate was 2578 per boe for the year ended december 31 2011 and 1964 per boe for the year ended december 31 2010 the average depletion rate includes oil and gas depletion and other property and equipment depreciation the depletion rate increase was due primarily to an increase in costs and a decrease in proved reserves at december 31 2011 

general and administrative expense  general and administrative expense increased 619000  from 3036000  for the year ended december 31 2010 to 3655000  for the year ended december 31 2011 a 2012000 increase primarily attributable to salary and equity based compensation expense for our new executive team was partially offset by the capitalization of 871000 of such expense and a 522000 increase in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity 

net interest expense  net interest expense for the year ended december 31 2011 was 2517000 as compared to 802000 for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 1715000 our weighted average outstanding principal under our credit agreement was 68520000 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 21245000 for 2010 due to our increased drilling activity 

derivatives  we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes as a result we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the realized and unrealized changes in fair value on derivative instruments in the combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned “gain loss on derivative instruments” for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a realized loss on settlement of derivative instruments of 37000 and 148000 respectively for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we had an unrealized loss on open derivative instruments of 12972000 and zero respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been capital contributions and loans from our equity sponsor borrowings under our credit facility proceeds from our ipo and cash flows from operations our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties as we pursue reserves and production growth we regularly consider which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us 

liquidity and cash flow 

our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010 are presented below 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 49692000  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 30998000  for the year ended december 31 2011  the increase in operating cash flows is largely a result of our increased drilling activities throughout 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities was 30998000  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 5192000  for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in operating cash flows is due to an overall increase in production revenues partially offset by increased expenses as discussed above in “—results of operations” 

our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions regional and worldwide economic activity weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

investing activities 

the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities we used cash for investing activities of 183078000  81108000  and 55236000  during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we spent 100090000  on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 65 gross 44 net wells we spent an additional 11707000  on leasehold costs 1102000  for the purchase of other property and equipment and 6637000  net on the settlement of derivative transactions on october 11 2012 we acquired all of the oil and natural gas properties of gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for i 7914036 shares of our common stock ii 63590000 in the form of a noninterest bearing promissory note that was repaid in full upon the closing of our initial public offering and iii a postclosing cash adjustment of approximately 18550000 

during 2011 we spent 76470000  on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 56 gross 32 net wells we spent an additional 3704000  on leasehold costs 7065000  for the purchase of other property and equipment 4137000 for the purchase of certain assets real estate and leasehold interests which were subsequently contributed to muskie and 2460000 for the purchase of drilling rigs and other equipment which were subsequently contributed to bison these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of 6000000  from a partial sale of our equity investment 55000  from the sale of property and equipment and 76000  from the settlement of nonhedge derivative investments and margin deposits 

during 2010 we spent 39230000  on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 43 gross 27 net wells we spent an additional 5344000  for the purchase and development of leasehold interests 11741000 million for the purchase of drilling rigs well servicing equipment and other equipment which were subsequently contributed to bison and 191000  for the settlement of nonhedge derivative instruments and margin deposits these amounts were partially offset by the 1250000 we received from the sale of approximately 10946 net acres of non producing acreage in the permian basin 

our investing activities for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  are summarized in the following table 



financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 152785000  as compared to 52950000  for 2011  on october 17 2012 our ipo was completed and we received net proceeds of approximately 2341 million after deducting the underwriting discount during 2012 and 2011 we borrowed 15000000 and 40233000 respectively under our revolving credit facility all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were repaid with proceeds of the ipo during 2012 we borrowed 30000000 under our subordinated note with wexford this note was repaid with proceeds of the ipo and was canceled during 2012 and 2011 we received capital contributions from our members of 4008000 and 13517000 respectively these proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and purchase property and equipment during the year ended december 31 2012 we paid 2887000  for costs associated with our initial public offering 

net cash provided by financing activities for 2011  was 52950000  as compared to 51733000  for 2010  during 2011  we borrowed 40233000  under our revolving credit facility and received capital contributions from our members of 13517000 these proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and purchase property and equipment 

net cash provided by financing activities for 2010  was 51733000  the net cash provided by financing activities in 2010  is primarily attributable to borrowings of 61066000  under our revolving credit facility partially offset by principal payments of 23950000  under our prior credit facility with the bank of oklahoma na during 2010  we received capital contributions from our members of 28508000 which included a noncash contribution of property of 7594000 and were partially offset by distributions to our members of 5579000 we paid 718000  in debt issuance costs in 2010  we used the net proceeds from our financing activities during 2010  to fund our drilling costs the purchase of property and equipment the purchase of tubular goods inventory and the acquisition and development of leasehold interests 

credit facility 

on october 15 2010 we entered into a secured loan agreement with bnp paribas or bnp as the administrative agent sole book runner and lead arranger on may 10 2012 the revolving credit agreement was amended to provide for the resignation of bnp and the appointment of wells fargo bank national association as administrative agent for the lenders the loan agreement as amended provides for a 250 million revolving credit facility subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves the “borrowing base” the outstanding borrowings bear interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime libor or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 125 to 350 depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base 

principal may be optionally repaid from time to time and is required to be paid a if the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise and b at the maturity date of october 15 2014 we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee equal to 05 per year of the unused portion of the borrowing base the loan is secured by substantially all of our assets the borrowing base is redetermined semiannually with effective dates of april 1st and october 1st in addition we may request up to three additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12month period the borrowing base was 450 million at december 31 2010 the borrowing base was increased several times during 2011 as a result of redeterminations and at december 31 2011 the borrowing base was 1000 million the borrowing base increased in 2012 through redeterminations and at december 31 2012 the borrowing base was 1350 million in connection with the ipo we 

repaid all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and as of december 31 2012 had no outstanding borrowings 

our revolving credit agreement contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants these covenants among other things prohibit additional indebtedness additional liens sales of assets mergers and consolidations dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of various financial ratios described below 

as of july 24 2012 our revolving credit agreement was amended and restated to include diamondback energy llc and its subsidiaries as additional guarantors to the facility the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness was also amended to allow the issuance of unsecured debt of up to 2500 million and in connection with any such issuance the reduction of the borrowing base by 25 of the principal amount of such issuance a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid the amendment also provided that redemptions of any unsecured debt will be restricted unless certain liquidity requirements are met further the amendment modified certain financial ratios the current requirements of which are described below 



our revolving credit agreement defines ebitdax for any period as the sum of our consolidated net income for such period plus the following expenses or charges to the extent deducted from our consolidated net income for such period interest income taxes depreciation depletion amortization and exploration expenses extraordinary items and other similar noncash charges including expenses related to stockbased compensation and hedging minus all noncash income added to our consolidated net income 

as of july 31 2012 the first amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement was executed which provided for the issuance to gulfport of the gulfport transaction note and the payment of the gulfport transaction note from the proceeds of our initial public offering 

as of september 28 2012 the second amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement was executed which among other things provided for an increase in permitted subordinated debt in a maximum principal amount not to exceed 450 million including any such indebtedness evidenced by our subordinated note with an affiliate of wexford described in more detail under “subordinated note” below waived compliance with our current ratio covenant for the quarter ending september 30 2012 and increased the aggregate limitation on lease payments during any period of twelve consecutive months from 250000 to 550000 

as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of any event of default unless we cure any such default within any applicable grace period for payments of principal and interest under our revolving credit facility we generally have a three business day grace period and a 30day cure period for most covenant defaults but not for defaults of certain specific covenants including the financial covenants and negative covenants 

prior revolving credit facility 

on september 17 2009 we entered into a revolving credit facility with the bank of oklahoma na or bok the bok revolving credit facility had a maximum principal amount of 500 million subject to a collateral borrowing base calculation which was based on the underlying reserve value of the oil and natural gas properties securing the credit facility and outstanding letters of credit the bok revolving credit facility was repaid in full in october 2010 with borrowings under the bnp revolving credit facility and then terminated 

borrowings under the bok revolving credit facility bore interest at our election of either bok’s listed national prime rate plus an interest rate spread ranging from 10 to 25 based on borrowing levels payable monthly or at libor rates plus an interest rate spread ranging from 25 to 40 based on borrowing levels payable at the end 

of the applicable interest period the credit facility agreement allowed bok to charge a 025 commitment fee on the unused available borrowing 

the bok revolving credit facility was collateralized by oil and natural gas properties and contained certain financial and nonfinancial covenants which included providing quarterly financial statements and annual audited financial statements providing semiannual reserve engineering reports restrictions on distributions to members restrictions on incurring additional debt restrictions on financial derivative contracts maintaining a funded debt to earnings before hedge gains or losses asset gains or losses depreciation depletion amortization and interest expense of no greater than 30 to 10 

subordinated note 

effective may 14 2012 we executed an unsecured subordinated note with an affiliate of wexford pursuant to which as amended the wexford affiliate could from time to time advance up to an aggregate 450 million these advances were solely at wexford’s discretion and neither wexford nor any of its affiliates had any commitment or obligation to provide further capital support to us the note bore interest at a rate equal to libor plus 028 or 8 per annum whichever was lower interest was due quarterly in arrears beginning on july 1 2012 interest payments were payable in kind by adding such amounts to the principal balance of the note the unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest on the note was due and payable in full on january 31 2015 or the earlier completion of our initial public offering any indebtedness evidenced by this note was subordinate in the right of payment to any indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility we repaid the outstanding borrowings under this note in full with a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the note was canceled 

capital requirements and sources of liquidity 

we currently anticipate our 2013 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure will be approximately 2700 million to 3000 million for 2013 we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted we intend to allocate these expenditures as follows 

 however the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2013 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals seasonal conditions drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners 

based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2013 we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through yearend 2013 however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties further our 2013 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities changes in prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control if we require additional capital we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings joint venture partnerships production payment financing asset sales offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms we may be required to curtail our drilling programs which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations in addition we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 

contractual obligations and other commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2012  





critical accounting policies 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states below we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies estimates and judgments we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements see note 1 of the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k 

use of estimates 

certain amounts included in or affecting our combined consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the combined consolidated financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties asset retirement obligations the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities stockbased compensation fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes 

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 

we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting accordingly all costs incurred in the acquisition exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties including the costs of abandoned properties dry holes geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest to the extent they exceed related costs incurred are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves 

costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant the assessment includes consideration of the following factors among others intent to drill remaining lease term geological and geophysical evaluations drilling results and activity the assignment of proved reserves and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 

oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue 

our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions as a result material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates if such changes are material they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate accordingly reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 

revenue recognition 

oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser net of royalty interests discounts and allowances as applicable we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves no receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided 

impairment 

the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation depletion 

amortization impairment and deferred income taxes exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves less any related income tax effects the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense in calculating future net revenues prices are calculated as the average oil and gas prices during the preceding 12month period prior to the end of the current reporting period determined as the unweighted arithmetic average firstdayofthemonth prices for the prior 12month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 

asset retirement obligations 

we measure the future cost to retire our tangible longlived assets and recognize such cost as a liability in accordance with asc topic 410 asset retirement and environmental obligations  “asc topic 410” which provides accounting and reporting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction or normal operation of a longlived asset asc topic 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the corresponding cost be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the liability is accreted to its then present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties 

our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory political environmental safety and public relations considerations we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells the ultimate productive life of the properties a riskadjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance

from time to time we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship we enter into counterswaps from time to time for the purpose of lockingin the value of a swap under the counterswap we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty the counterswap is effective in lockingin the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counterswap for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments we designate the hedging instrument based on the exposure being hedged as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of instruments designated as a fair value hedge offset changes in the fair value of the hedge item and changes in the fair value of instruments designated as cash flow hedges are shown in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments the unrealized gain or loss on the change in fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 718 “compensation—stock compensation” we grant various types of stockbased awards including stock options and restricted stock units these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 8—stock and equity based compensation stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed net of estimated forfeitures over the required service period 

income taxes 

we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of 1 temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and 2 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future 

period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  in january 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  the guidance in asu no 201301 limits the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosures to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions to the extent that they are 1 offset in the financial statements or 2 subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to understand significant quantitative differences in balance sheets prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” and international financial reporting standards related to the offsetting of financial instruments the existing gaap guidance allowing balance sheet offsetting including industryspecific guidance remains unchanged the guidance in asu no 201111and asu no 201301 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 the disclosures should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flow 

inflation 

inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended 2012 2011 and 2010 although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we currently have no offbalance sheet arrangements please read note 13 included in notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv item 15 of this form 10k for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas production pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control 

we use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales under these swap contracts we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty based on new york mercantile exchange light sweet crude oil pricing the fixedprice payment and the floatingprice payment are offset resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty for the purpose of lockingin the value of a swap we enter into counterswaps from time to time under the counterswap we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty the counterswap is effective in lockingin the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counterswap 

in december 2007 we placed a swap contract covering 1680000 bbls of crude oil for the period from january 2008 to december 2012 at various fixed prices in april 2008 we entered into a series of counterswaps to lockin the value of certain of these swaps settling 1188000 bbls of crude oil swaps in june 2009 we entered into an additional series of counterswaps to lockin the value of the remaining swaps settling 324000 bbls of crude oil swaps in october 2011 we placed a swap contract covering 730000 bbls of crude oil for the period from january 2012 to december 2013 at a fixed price of 7850 for 2012 and 8055 for 2013 such contracts and any future hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances where 

production is less than expected or oil prices increase in addition these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil 

at december 31 2012 we had a net liability derivative position of 5205000 related to our price swap derivatives as compared to a net liability derivative position of 14459000 as of december 31 2011 related to our price swap derivatives utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes as of december 31 2012 a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net liability of these instruments by approximately 3673000 while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net liability for these instruments by 3673000 however any realized derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase respectively in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 

counterparty and customer credit risk 

our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables approximately 5959000 at december 31 2012 and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production approximately 8081000 at december 31 2012 

we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results for the year ended december 31 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our revenue plains marketing lp 53 occidental energy marketing inc 16 and andrews oil buyers inc 10 for the year ended december 31 2011 windsor midstream llc an entity controlled by wexford accounted for approximately 79 of our revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our revenue during these periods 

joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells at december 31 2012 we had one customer that represented approximately 97 of our total joint operations receivables at december 31 2011 we had one customer that represented approximately 68 of our total joint operations receivables 

interest rate risk 

we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to prime libor or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 125 to 350 depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of zero as of december 31 2012 as we did not have any amounts outstanding under the credit facility on october 17 2012 the last date on which borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility such borrowings bore interest at a weighted average rate 372 an increase or decrease of 1 in the interest rate would have a compounding decrease or increase in our net income loss of approximately 1000000 based on the 100000000 outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility on october 17 2012
