our business 

we are a fortune 500 company based in san antonio texas our corporate offices are at one valero way san antonio texas 78249 and our telephone number is 210 3452000 we were incorporated in delaware in 1981 under the name valero refining and marketing company we changed our name to valero energy corporation in 1997 our common stock trades on the new york stock exchange nyse under the trading symbol “vlo” 

we are a multinational manufacturer and marketer of petroleumbased and lowcarbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products and we sell our products primarily in the united states us canada the united kingdom uk ireland and latin america we own 15 petroleum refineries located in the us canada and the uk with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 32 million barrels per day bpd we are a joint venture member in diamond green diesel holdings llc dgd 1  which owns a renewable diesel plant located in the gulf coast region of the us with a production capacity of 700 million gallons per year and we own 12 ethanol plants located in the midcontinent region of the us with a combined production capacity of approximately 16 billion gallons per year we manage our operations through our refining renewable diesel and ethanol segments see “our operations” below for additional information about the operations products and properties of each of our reportable segments 

our comprehensive liquid fuels strategy 

overview 

we strive to manage our business to responsibly meet the world’s growing demand for reliable and affordable energy we believe that liquid transportation fuels—both petroleumbased and lowcarbon— help meet that demand and we expect that they will continue to be an essential source of transportation fuels well into the future our strategic actions have enabled us to be a lowcost efficient and reliable supplier of these liquid transportation fuels to much of the world 

1 dgd is a joint venture with darling ingredients inc darling and we consolidate dgd’s financial statements see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our accounting for dgd 

our petroleum refineries operate in locations with current operating cost andor other advantages as described below under “our operations— refining ” and we believe our refineries are positioned to meet the strong worldwide demand for our petroleumbased products through our refining business we believe that we have developed expertise in liquid fuels manufacturing and a platform for the marketing and distribution of liquid fuels and we seek to leverage this expertise and platform to expand and optimize our lowcarbon fuels businesses we expect that lowcarbon liquid fuels will continue to be a growing part of the energy mix and we have made multibilliondollar investments to develop and grow our lowcarbon renewable diesel and ethanol businesses as described below under “our operations— renewable diesel ” and “ —ethanol ” these businesses have made us one of the world’s largest lowcarbon fuels producers and have helped governments across the world achieve their greenhouse gas ghg emissions reduction targets even so we continue to seek lowcarbon fuel opportunities and to improve our environmental social and governance esg practices 

regulations policies and standards driving lowcarbon fuel demand 

governments across the world have issued or are considering issuing lowcarbon fuel regulations policies and standards to help reduce ghg emissions and increase the percentage of lowcarbon fuels in the transportation fuel mix these regulations policies and standards include but are not limited to the rfs lcfs and similar programs collectively the renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs the rfs and lcfs programs are defined and discussed below under “us environmental protection agency epa renewable fuel standard rfs program” and “california low carbon fuel standard lcfs” while many of these regulations policies and standards result in additional costs to our refining business they have created opportunities for us to develop our renewable diesel and ethanol businesses and they should continue to help drive the demand for our renewable diesel and ethanol products we believe that our ability to supply these lowcarbon fuels can play an important role in helping achieve ghg emissions reduction targets 

the us and california lowcarbon fuel regulations policies and standards discussed below currently have the most significant impact on our business however other municipal state and national governments across the world including in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have issued or are considering issuing similar lowcarbon fuel regulations policies and standards see “item 1a risk factors—legal governmental and regulatory risks— compliance with or developments concerning the renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs and other regulations policies and standards impacting the demand for lowcarbon fuels could adversely affect our performance ” in addition see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our accounting for the costs of the blending programs under “ costs of renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs” note 21 for disclosure of the costs of the blending programs under “renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs price risk” and note 18 for disclosure of our blender’s tax credits under “ segment information ” 

us environmental protection agency epa renewable fuel standard rfs program 

the epa created the rfs program pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 under the rfs program by november 30 of each year the epa is required to set annual quotas for the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into petroleumbased transportation fuels consumed in the us in the next compliance year the quotas are set by class of renewable fuel ie biomassbased diesel cellulosic biofuel advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel and are collectively referred to as the renewable volume obligation rvo the rvo must be met by obligated parties who are the producers and importers of the petroleumbased transportation fuels consumed in the us obligated parties demonstrate compliance annually by retiring the appropriate number of renewable identification numbers rins associated with each class of renewable fuel to 

satisfy their obligations for the previous calendar year a rin is effectively a compliance credit that is assigned to each gallon of qualifying renewable fuel produced in or imported into the us rins are obtained by blending renewable fuels into petroleumbased transportation fuels and obligated parties can also achieve compliance by purchasing rins in the open market 

we are an obligated party under this program and our refining segment incurs obligations as a result of being a producer and importer of petroleumbased transportation fuels consumed in the us but we are also a renewable fuels producer and blender under this program and generate rins as a result of being a producer and blender of renewable diesel renewable naphtha and ethanol therefore there is a cost to our refining business from this program because we must purchase rins to comply with our rvo however we also generate revenue from this program because we produce and sell qualifying renewable fuels 

california low carbon fuel standard lcfs 

under california’s global warming solutions act of 2006 the california air resources board carb was required to undertake a statewide effort to reduce ghg emissions one of the programs designed to help achieve those reductions is the lcfs program the lcfs program is designed to reduce ghg emissions by decreasing the carbon intensity ci of transportation fuels consumed in the state under this program each fuel is assigned a ci value which is intended to represent the ghg emissions associated with the feedstocks from which the fuel was produced the fuel production and distribution activities and the use of the finished fuel cis are determined using a carbdeveloped life cycle ghg emissions analysis model and ci pathways are certified by the carb after lowcarbon fuel producers submit operational data to demonstrate the life cycle ghg emissions the certified cis for both lowcarbon and petroleumbased fuels are compared to a declining annual benchmark fuels below the benchmark generate credits while fuels above the benchmark generate deficits the lower the fuel’s ci score compared to the benchmark the greater number of credits generated each producer or importer of fuel must demonstrate that the overall mix of fuels it supplies for use in california meets the ci benchmarks for each compliance period a producer or importer with a fuel mix that is above the ci benchmark must purchase lcfs credits sufficient to meet the ci benchmark 

we produce and import petroleumbased transportation fuels in california and thus must blend lowci fuels or purchase credits to meet the ci benchmark however fuels produced by our renewable diesel and ethanol segments have ci scores that are lower than traditional petroleumbased transportation fuels and we benefit from the demand from other regulated entities for these lowcarbon products in addition the demand for some of these lowcarbon transportation fuels tends to drive higher values for those fuels compared to petroleumbased transportation fuels due to their lower ci scores we seek to pursue opportunities to further lower the ci of many of our products including our lowcarbon fuels see “ our lowcarbon projects ” below 

us federal tax incentives 

the us federal government has enacted tax incentives to encourage the production of lowcarbon fuels andor reduce ghg emissions for example section 6426 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code provides a tax credit generally referred to as the blender’s tax credit to blenders of certain renewable fuels to encourage the production and blending of those fuels with traditional petroleumbased transportation fuels only blenders that have produced a mixture and either sold or used the fuel mixture as fuel are eligible for the blender’s tax credit the renewable diesel produced by our renewable diesel segment is a liquid fuel derived from biomass that meets the epa’s fuel registration requirements therefore renewable diesel that we produce and blend qualifies for this refundable tax credit of one dollar per gallon under existing legislation this credit will not apply to any sale or use of 

renewable diesel for any period after december 31 2022 unless extended the build back better act as passed by the us house of representatives on november 19 2021 would extend this credit through december 31 2026 but there is no certainty that this legislation will become law or that the provision contained in this legislation authorizing the credit or the amount of the credit will not be revised however legislation authorizing this credit has been extended or retroactively extended since its inception in 2004 

in addition section 45q 45q of the code provides federal income tax credits to certain taxpayers who capture and sequester store or use qualified carbon oxides eg carbon dioxide in accordance with the provisions of 45q  we continually evaluate such federal income tax incentives and may strategically pursue certain opportunities to optimize the potential benefits therefrom for instance the carbon capture and sequestration projects at our ethanol plants discussed below under “ our lowcarbon projects ” sho uld increase the value of the ethanol product produced at those plants by helping decrease its ci score and through the expected generation of 45q tax credits  

our lowcarbon projects 

we have invested 42 billion 2 to date in our lowcarbon fuels businesses and we expect additional growth opportunities in this area in 2021 we completed the expansion of dgd’s existing renewable diesel plant the dgd plant the expansion increased the dgd plant’s renewable diesel production capacity by 410 million gallons per year bringing dgd’s total renewable diesel production capacity to 700 million gallons per year and provided dgd with the ability to produce 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha also in 2021 dgd commenced construction of its second plant over the next 15 months we expect to invest approximately 800 million to complete the construction of dgd’s second plant which is expected to have a production capacity of 470 million gallons of renewable diesel and 20 million gallons of renewable naphtha per year see “our operations— renewable diesel ” below for additional information about the expansion of our renewable diesel business 

we continue to evaluate and advance investments in economic lowcarbon projects including projects that are intended to lower the ci of our products for example in march 2021 we announced our participation in a largescale carbon capture and sequestration pipeline system in the midcontinent region of the us that is expected to capture transport and store carbon dioxide that results from the ethanol manufacturing process at our eight ethanol plants located in iowa minnesota nebraska and south dakota we expect to be the anchor shipper with those eight ethanol plants connected to the system the capture and sequestration of this carbon dioxide should result in the generation of 45q tax credits and the production of a lower ci ethanol product that we expect to market in lowcarbon fuel markets which is expected to result in a higher value for this product a third party is expected to construct own and operate the system and we believe that our capital investment to purchase install and connect the applicable carbon capture equipment to the system will not be material initial service is anticipated to begin in late 2024 additionally certain of our other ethanol plants are located near geology believed to be suitable for sequestering carbon dioxide and we are evaluating standalone projects to sequester carbon dioxide that results from the ethanol manufacturing process at those plants see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources— our capital resources 

2 our investment to date in our lowcarbon fuels businesses consists of 25 billion in capital investments to build our renewable diesel business and 17 billion to build our ethanol business capital investments in renewable diesel represent 100 percent of the capital investments made by dgd see also “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources— our capital resources —capital investments” which is incorporated by reference into this item for our definition of capital investments 

—capital investments” for further discussion of our capital investments associated with lowcarbon projects 

environmental management systems 

we have welldeveloped management structures that are central to our decision making and risk management including three programs that support our environmental management as follows 

• our commitment to excellence management system ctems is a proprietary systematic approach to planning executing checking and acting to improve everyday work activities at many of our refineries and plants ctems has 10 elements leadership accountability protecting people and the environment people and skills development operations reliability and mechanical integrity technical excellence and knowledge management change management business competitiveness stakeholder relationships assurance and review and continual improvement risks related to regulatory issues and physical threats to our refineries and plants are among those assessed as we implement ctems 

• environmental excellence and risk assessment eera elevates the environmental audit and compliance functions to an environmental excellence vision its main goal is to assess the design and effectiveness of environmental performance regarding specific excellence objectives and to facilitate continuous improvement across the company eera defines more than 100 expectations and involves a proprietary fivestep process using due diligence on data and field assessments reviewed by a combination of external and internal subject matter experts 

• our fuels regulatory assurance program provides operational safeguards software training and protocols for uniformity across our refineries and plants to reinforce our compliance with applicable fuels regulations building on the success of this system we are developing a proprietary lowcarbon assurance program designed to provide tools and oversight to assure compliance with the increasingly complex array of lowcarbon fuels programs 

our operations 

our operations are managed through the following reportable segments 

• our refining segment which includes the operations of our petroleum refineries the associated activities to market our refined petroleum products and the logistics assets that support those operations 

• our renewable diesel segment which includes the operations of dgd and the associated activities to market renewable diesel and

america we have invested in or grown our access to terminals and transloading facilities in mexico and peru our us gulf coast refineries are well positioned to support export growth to latin america and other countries around the world 

renewable diesel 

our relationship with dgd 

dgd is a joint venture that we consolidate we entered into the dgd joint venture in 2011 and it began operations in 2013 see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our accounting for dgd we operate the dgd plant and perform certain management functions for dgd as an independent contractor under an agreement with dgd 

renewable diesel plant 

the dgd plant produces renewable diesel and is located next to our st charles refinery in norco louisiana renewable diesel is a lowcarbon liquid transportation fuel that is interchangeable with petroleumbased diesel renewable diesel is produced from waste and renewable feedstocks using a pretreatment process and an advanced hydroprocessingisomerization process the market value of the renewable diesel can vary based on regional policies feedstock preferences and ci scores waste feedstocks predominantly animal fats used cooking oils and inedible distillers corn oil are the preferred feedstocks due to their lower ci scores while several other companies have made or have announced interest in making investments in renewable diesel projects the dgd plant is currently one of only a few operational facilities that has the capacity to process 100 percent waste and renewable feedstocks and this feedstock flexibility currently provides a margin advantage 

the dgd plant receives waste and renewable feedstocks primarily by rail trucks ships and barges owned by third parties dgd is party to a raw material supply agreement with darling under which darling is obligated to offer to dgd a portion of its feedstock requirements at market pricing but dgd is not obligated to purchase all or any part of its feedstock from darling therefore dgd pursues the most optimal feedstock supply available 

dgd began an expansion of the dgd plant in 2019 and operations commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 this expansion increased the dgd plant’s renewable diesel production capacity by 410 million gallons per year bringing dgd’s total renewable diesel production capacity to 700 million gallons per year and provided dgd with the ability to produce 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha renewable naphtha is used to produce renewable gasoline and renewable plastics 

additionally in january 2021 dgd began construction of a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant located next to our port arthur refinery in port arthur texas this new plant is expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to increase dgd’s total renewable diesel and renewable naphtha production capacities to approximately 12 billion gallons per year and 50 million gallons per year respectively 

marketing 

dgd sells renewable diesel under the diamond green diesel® brand primarily to be blended with petroleumbased diesel and to end users for use in their operations dgd sells renewable diesel domestically and into international markets primarily canada and europe renewable diesel is distributed primarily by rail and ships owned by third parties 

ethanol 

ethanol plants 

our ethanol business began in 2009 with the purchase of our first ethanol plants we have since grown the business by purchasing additional ethanol plants our 12 ethanol plants are located in the midcontinent region of the us and they have a combined ethanol production capacity of approximately 16 billion gallons per year our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities that process corn to produce ethanol and various coproducts including livestock feed dry distillers grains or ddgs and syrup and inedible corn oil 

the following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants their annual production capacities for ethanol in millions of gallons and ddgs in tons and their annual corn processing capacities in millions of bushels 



 

a these plants are expected to participate in the carbon capture and sequestration pipeline system discussed in “ our lowcarbon projects” above 

b this plant is able to produce uspgrade ethanol a product that typically has a higher market value than fuelgrade ethanol which reduces its ethanol production capacity to approximately 55 million gallons per year usp stands for us pharmacopeia and is an organization that develops quality and safety standards for medicine food and dietary supplements 

the foregoing table excludes data relating to our jefferson wisconsin and riga michigan ethanol plants which ceased operations in 2021 and 2020 respectively see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our accounting for these ceased operations 

we source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators we publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to facilitate corn supply transactions our plants receive corn primarily by rail and truck 

marketing 

we sell our ethanol under term and spot contracts in bulk markets in the us we also export our ethanol into the global markets we distribute our ethanol primarily by rail using some railcars owned by us and 

thirdparty trucks barges and vessels we sell ddgs primarily to animal feed customers in the us mexico and asia which are transported primarily by thirdparty rail trucks and vessels 

seasonality 

demand for gasoline diesel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction the demand for renewable diesel has not significantly fluctuated by season ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline and as a result ethanol demand typically moves in line with the demand for gasoline 

government regulations 

we incorporate by reference into this item the disclosures on government regulations including environmental regulations contained in the following sections of this report 

• —our comprehensive liquid fuels strategy— regulations policies and standards driving lowcarbon fuel demand ” 

• “item 1a risk factors—legal governmental and regulatory risks” and 

• “item 3 legal proceedings—environmental enforcement matters” 

capital expenditures attributable to compliance with government regulations 

compliance with government regulations including environmental regulations did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures in 2021 and we currently do not expect that compliance with these regulations will have material effects on our capital expenditures in 2022 

other 

because our business is heavily regulated our costs for compliance with government regulations are significant and can be material especially costs associated with the renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs disclosed in notes 20 and 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference into this item 

human capital 

we believe that our employees provide a competitive advantage for our success we seek to foster a culture that supports diversity equality and inclusion and we strive to provide a safe healthy and rewarding work environment for our employees with opportunities for professional growth and longterm financial stability 

headcount 

on december 31 2021 we had 9813 employees these employees were located in the following countries 



of our total employees as of december 31 2021 1764 were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements and 9794 were in permanent fulltime positions see also “item 1a risk factors—general risk factors —our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators ” 

company culture and human capital people strategy 

our company culture and our welldefined expectations of ethics and behavior guide the daily work of our employees and support our efforts to produce exceptional company results the six values that define our culture are safety accountability teamwork excellence do the right thing and caring  

our people strategy and programs are designed and implemented in support of our business and strategic objectives in building and fostering great teams we are guided by the following 

• we strive to hire and promote toptalent employees with teamoriented work ethics and values 

• our pay benefits and support programs are designed to attract and retain excellent employees and to reward innovation ingenuity and excellence 

• we seek to provide a bestinclass diverse and inclusive work environment built on a foundation of respect accountability and trust 

• we promote a culture of learning intended to drive excellence at all levels of the organization and to foster careerlong growth and development opportunities for employees and 

• we continually assess employee performance organizational structures and succession plans to support operational excellence efficiency and effectiveness 

diversity equality and inclusion 

we believe that having a diverse workforce and inclusive teams provides strengths and advantages for our success and our board of directors board and management team strive to promote and improve 

diversity equality and inclusion of our total employees as of december 31 2021 approximately 30 percent of our global professional employees were female 11 percent of our hourly employees were female and 19 percent of total employees were female approximately 36 percent of our us employees have selfidentified as hispanic or latino black or african american asian american indian or alaskan native native hawaiian or other pacific islander or as two or more races we strive to recruit and retain a diverse workforce and foster a culture of inclusion through various efforts including targeted recruiting strategies aimed at improving our outreach to underrepresented groups and educational and training programs on diversityrelated topics such as objective hiring and the advantages of a diverse workforce we are also committed to hiring and retaining veterans and reservists of the us armed forces who represent 12 percent of our us workforce as of december 31 2021 

from our intern program to our board and at all levels between we strive to build diverse and inclusive teams our intern program class of 2021 was the most diverse in the history of our program with 39 percent being female and 34 percent representing a racial or ethnic minority and more than half of the independent members of our board represent diversity of gender or raceethnicity in furtherance of the board’s diversity goals the charter for the nominatinggovernance and public policy committee of the board was amended in 2021 to require that the initial list of candidates from which director nominees are chosen include but need not be limited to qualified diverse candidates known as a “rooney rule” amendment 

safety 

we believe that safety and reliability are extremely important not only for the protection of our employees and to the cultural values we aspire to as a company but also for operational success as a decrease in the number of employee safety events and process safety events should generally reduce unplanned shutdowns and increase the operational reliability of our refineries and plants this in turn should also translate into fewer environmental incidents a safer workplace lower environmental impacts and better community relations we strive to improve safety and reliability by offering yearround safety training programs for our employees and contractors and by seeking to promote the same expectations and culture of safety among all of our workforce we also seek to enhance our safety compliance by conducting safety audits quality assurance visits and comprehensive risk assessments 

in assessing safety performance we measure our annual total recordable incident rate trir which includes data with respect to our employees and contractors and is defined as the number of recordable injuries per 200000 working hours we also annually measure our tier 1 process safety event rate which is a metric defined by the american petroleum institute that looks at process safety events per 200000 total employee and contractor working hours we use these measures and believe they are helpful in assessing our safety performance because they evaluate performance relative to the numbers of hours being worked these metrics are also used by others in our industry which allows for a more objective comparison of our performance our refinery employee and contractor trir for 2021 was 021 and 026 respectively and our refinery tier 1 process safety event rate for 2021 was 005 as a result 2021 was our best year so far in terms of safety performance 

compensation and benefits 

we believe that it is important to provide our employees with competitive compensation and benefits the benefits we offer to employees depending on work location and eligibility status include among others healthcare plans that are generally available to all employees extended sick leave newparent leave access to financial planning programs to support dualworking parents at different stages of their careers caregiver support networks including an onsite child care center at our headquarters and support for children and parents with disabilities a company 401k matching program various companysponsored 

pension plans onsite employee wellness centers also available to eligible dependents at our headquarters tuition reimbursement programs fitness center access or a stipend and employee recognition programs

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor liquidity as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

our financial results are affected by volatile margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil corn and other feedstocks and the market price at which we can sell our products 

our financial results are affected by the relationship or margin between our product prices and the prices for crude oil corn and other feedstocks which can vary based on global regional and local market conditions as well as by type and class of product historically refining and ethanol margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future we expect that the volume of renewable diesel produced by competitors will increase going forward and as the market becomes more competitive or if there are changes in the regulations policies and standards affecting the demand for lowcarbon fuels our renewable diesel segment may experience increased volatility in product margins our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil corn and other feedstocks gasoline diesel other liquid transportation fuels such as jet fuel renewable diesel and ethanol and other products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls has also had and may continue to have a significant impact on the market prices of crude oil and certain of our products additionally the regulations policies and standards discussed under “items 1 and 2 business and properties—our comprehensive liquid fuels strategy— regulations policies and standards driving lowcarbon fuel demand ” have had and may continue to have a significant impact on the market prices of the feedstocks for and products produced by our lowcarbon fuels businesses any adverse change in these regulations policies and standards including the calculation of ci scores or in our ability to obtain any approved fuel pathways could have a material adverse effect on the margins we receive for our lowcarbon products in certain markets 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on product margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil corn waste and renewable feedstocks or other primary feedstocks and must purchase nearly all of the feedstocks we process we generally purchase our feedstocks long before we process them and sell the resulting products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the resulting products has had and in the future could continue to have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices could negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil inflation cybersecurity incidents and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of 

economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects refining renewable diesel and ethanol margins also can be significantly impacted by the addition of capacity through the expansion of existing facilities or the construction of new refineries or plants worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capacity exceeding refined petroleum product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products  previous declines in such differentials have had and any future declines would again have a negative impact on our results of operations 

technological and industry developments and evolving investor and market sentiment regarding fossil fuels and ghg emissions may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our performance 

a reduction in the demand for our products could result from a transition to alternative fuel vehicles by consumers such as electric vehicles evs and hybrid vehicles whether as a result of technological or scientific advances government mandates or consumer or investor sentiment towards fossil fuels and ghg emissions new or changing technologies may be developed that make alternative fuel vehicles more affordable or desirable including improvements in battery and storage technology increases to ev driving ranges increased availability of charging stations and other necessary infrastructure and increased inventory which may cause some consumers to shift to alternative fuel vehicles including vehicles that use alternative fuels other than the liquid fuels we produce 

additionally there may be new entrants into the renewable fuels industry that could meet demand for lowercarbon transportation fuels and modes of transportation in a more efficient or less costly manner than our technologies and products which could also have a material adverse effect on our lowcarbon fuels businesses for instance several other companies have made or announced interest in making investments in renewable diesel projects should these projects develop we would face competition from them for feedstocks and customers which could strain margins on the products we sell and limit the growth and profitability of our lowcarbon fuels businesses it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form timing or extent of any such developments however a reduction in the demand for our products as a result of any of the foregoing events could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

investor and market sentiment towards climate change fossil fuels ghg emissions environmental justice and other esg matters could adversely affect our business cost of capital and the price of our common stock and debt securities 

there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds pension funds universities and other groups to promote the divestment of securities of energy companies as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies as a result some financial intermediaries investors and other capital markets participants have reduced or ceased lending to or investing in companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure such as the energy industry 

additionally pension funds at the us state and municipal level as well as in other countries and jurisdictions across the world particularly in europe have announced similar plans if these or similar divestment efforts are continued the price of our common stock or debt securities and our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain new investment or financing may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on esg practices and disclosures including those related to climate change ghg emissions targets business resilience under the assumptions of demandconstrained scenarios and netzero ambitions in the energy industry in particular as well as diversity equality and inclusion initiatives political activities and governance standards among companies more generally as a result we may face negative publicity increasing pressure regarding our esg practices and disclosures and demands for esgfocused engagement from investors stakeholders and other interested parties  this could result in higher costs disruption and diversion of management attention an increased strain on our resources and the implementation of certain esg practices or disclosures that may present a heightened level of legal and regulatory risk or that threaten our credibility with other investors and stakeholders investors stakeholders and other interested parties are also increasingly focusing on issues related to environmental justice  this may result in increased scrutiny protests and negative publicity with respect to our business and operations and those of our counterparties which could in turn result in the cancellation or delay of projects the revocation or delay of permits termination of contracts lawsuits regulatory action and policy change that may adversely affect our business strategy increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation and financial performance 

additionally members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for esg performance before investing in our common stock or debt securities or lending to us credit rating agencies are also increasingly using esg as a factor in their assessments which could impact our cost of capital or access to financing there has also been an acceleration in investor demand for esg investing opportunities and many institutional investors have committed to increasing the percentage of their portfolios that are allocated towards esgfocused investments as a result there has been a proliferation of esgfocused investment funds and market participants seeking esgoriented investment products there has also been an increase in thirdparty providers of company esg ratings and more esgfocused voting policies among proxy advisory firms portfolio managers and institutional investors some investors and stakeholders are also increasingly focused on pursuing strategies centered on esgrelated activism 

if we are unable to meet the esg standards or investment lending ratings or voting criteria and policies set by these parties we may lose investors investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us we may become a target for esgfocused activism our cost of capital may increase the price of our securities may be negatively impacted and our reputation may also be negatively affected 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the related events and circumstances have had and may continue to have negative impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity and those of our customers suppliers and other counterparties 

at the onset of the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 governmental authorities around the world imposed restrictions such as stayathome orders and other social distancing measures to slow the spread of covid19 many companies and individuals implemented similar efforts these measures resulted in significant economic disruption globally as reduced economic activity negatively impacted many businesses including ours 

during 2020 we experienced a decline in the demand for most of the liquid transportation fuels that we produce and sell and thus also a decline in the market prices of those products due to a decrease in the level of individual movement and travel resulting from the restrictions and general public health concerns some governmental authorities began lifting restrictions in the latter part of 2020 and this continued to varying degrees throughout 2021 these actions have contributed to increasing levels of individual movement and travel and a resulting increase in the demand for and market prices of our products however some governmental authorities continue to impose some level of restrictions due in part to new outbreaks including those related to new variants of the virus such as the delta and omicron variants additionally the lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic and variants of the virus continue to negatively impact the level of air travel global supply chains and the labor market 

the distribution of vaccines beginning in late 2020 has helped decrease the rates and severity of infection and contributed to the lifting of many restrictions the ongoing distribution of vaccines may result in the continued lifting of restrictions globally and may be seen as a key factor contributing to the ongoing restoration of public confidence and thus also to stimulating and increasing global economic activity however the risk remains that vaccines may not be distributed widely on a timely basis they may not be as effective against new variants of the virus andor the level of individuals’ willingness to receive a vaccine may not be as strong or as timely as needed additionally some governmental authorities have announced requirements and mandates including steep fines for noncompliance on employers concerning workforce vaccination and testing many large companies across the world independent of such government regulations have also begun implementing vaccine requirements and mandates for their workforces or as a prerequisite to providing customers certain goods and services in person these requirements and mandates have evoked mixed reactions and have created additional challenges and costs both administratively and operationally for employers including us and our counterparties and their workforces developments with respect to such requirements and mandates are evolving at a rapid pace and the ultimate impact thereof remains uncertain the ultimate outcome of the uncertainties and other unforeseen effects of the covid19 pandemic could result in many adverse consequences including but not limited to reduced availability of critical staff necessary to maintain operations disruption or delays to supply chains for critical equipment or feedstock inflation reduced economic activity and individual movement that negatively impact demand for our products and increased administrative compliance and operational costs 

the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments particularly within the geographic areas where we operate and the related impact on overall economic activity all of which are currently unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time however the adverse impacts of the economic effects from the covid19 pandemic on our business have been and may continue to be significant 

the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity have also had and may continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the other risk factors in this section such risk factors may be amended or supplemented by subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q and other reports and documents we file with the sec after the date of this annual report on form 10k 

our operations depend on natural gas and electricity and such dependency could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our operations depend on the use of natural gas and electricity we consume a significant volume of natural gas and a significant amount of electricity to operate our refineries and plants and natural gas and 

electricity prices represent a large cost to our operations we also purchase other commodities whose price may vary depending on the price of natural gas or electricity prices for both natural gas and electricity can be volatile and therefore represent ongoing challenges to our operating results additionally the availability of natural gas and electricity can be affected by weather such as winter storm uri in 2021 pipeline interruptions grid outages and logistics disruptions as electrification continues to grow or if there are increased restrictions or costs imposed on the ability of electric utilities to utilize certain energy sources there will likely be increased strains on and risk to the integrity and resilience of electrical grids and natural gas and electricity supplies around the world which could negatively affect the cost reliability and availability of our natural gas and electricity supplies additionally increased governmental regulations and public opposition to pipeline and electricity generation and transmission projects may result in the underinvestment in or unavailability of the logistics assets and infrastructure necessary to obtain natural gas feedstocks and electricity in a reliable and costefficient manner 

although we actively manage these costs through contracting and hedging our exposure to price volatility when appropriate and by pursuing projects that reduce our reliance on third parties and fortify the resilience of our assets increases in prices for natural gas and electricity or disruptions to sources of natural gas and electricity supply could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil waste and renewable feedstocks corn and other feedstocks could adversely affect our operations 

a significant portion of our refining feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa europe asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional feedstock supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply our refineries and plants without access to waterborne deliveries or offtake must rely on rail pipeline or ground transportation and thus may be more susceptible to such risks if we are unable to obtain adequate volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected including from reduced sales volumes of products or reduced margins as a result of higher costs additionally the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries for instance us sanctions with respect to iran and venezuela limit the ability of us companies to engage in oil transactions involving these countries and currently there is a possibility of increased sanctions against russia as well as potential responsive countermeasures these restrictions and those of other governments may limit our access to business opportunities in various countries actions by the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and may continue to do so in the future 

although darling the other joint venture member in dgd supplies some of dgd’s feedstock at competitive pricing dgd must still secure a significant amount of its feedstock requirements from other sources should darling’s supply be disrupted or should supply from other sources become limited or only available at unfavorable terms dgd could be required to develop alternate sources of supply and it could be required to increase its utilization of feedstocks that produce lower margin products to the extent the volume of renewable diesel produced by competitors begins to increase the competition for feedstocks will likely increase which could place downward pressure on the margins associated with the 

products produced by dgd should dgd’s feedstock supply be disrupted such an event could adversely impact its and our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our ethanol segment relies on corn sourced from local farmers and commercial elevators in the midcontinent region of the us as a result the feedstock supply of our ethanol segment is acutely exposed to the effects that weather and other environmental events occurring in that region can have on the amount or timing of crop production crop production can also be affected by governmental policies such as farming subsidies and by market factors such as changes in fertilizer prices any reduction or delay in crop production from these or similar events could reduce and disrupt the supply of or otherwise increase our costs to obtain feedstocks for our ethanol segment 

we are subject to risks arising from our operations outside the us and generally to worldwide political and economic developments 

we operate and sell some of our products outside of the us particularly in canada europe mexico peru and latin american countries other than mexico and peru our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets including due to expropriation or impoundment of assets failure of foreign governments and stateowned entities to honor their contracts property disputes economic instability restrictions on the transfer of funds duties and tariffs transportation delays import and export controls labor unrest security issues involving key personnel and governmental decisions investigations regulations issuances or revocations of permits and other authorizations and changing regulatory and political environments the occurrence of any such event could result in commercial restrictions delay or cancellation of projects increased costs and otherwise reduce our profitability in the us and abroad 

we are also required to comply with us and international laws and regulations actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business cause us to incur significant legal expenses and result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and other feedstocks and the products that we manufacture 

we use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our refineries and plants and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels trucks or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events cybersecurity incidents accidents derailments collisions fires explosions or governmental or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

competitors that produce their own supply of crude oil feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for thirdparty retail outlets for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive networks of retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and they may be better 

positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries or renewable diesel or ethanol plants could adversely affect our business 

our refineries renewable diesel plant and ethanol plants are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries or plants were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes or manmade disasters such as cybersecurity incidents or acts of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery or plant were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery or plant could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining renewable diesel or ethanol systems could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil waste and renewable feedstocks corn and many of our products 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and the political and regulatory environments or other market conditions may change or deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics political and regulatory environments and the expected return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete during which time the political and regulatory environment or other market conditions may change from our forecast as a result we may not fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our investments in joint ventures and other entities decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control over certain economic legal and business interests with other joint venture members we also conduct some of our operations through entities in which we have no equity ownership interest such as some of the consolidated variable interest entities vies as described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements the other joint venture members and the thirdparty equity holders of the vies may have economic business or legal interests opportunities or goals that are inconsistent with or different from our opportunities goals and interests or may have different liquidity needs or financial condition characteristics than our own be subject to different legal or contractual obligations than we are or be unable to meet their obligations for instance while we operate the dgd plant and perform certain daytoday operating and management functions for dgd as an independent contractor we do not have full control of every aspect of dgd’s business and certain significant decisions concerning dgd including among others the acquisition or disposition of assets above a certain value threshold making certain changes to dgd’s business plan raising debt or equity capital dgd’s distribution policy and entering into particular transactions which also require certain approvals from darling additionally although we consolidate certain vies we do not have full control of every aspect of these vies or the actions taken by their thirdparty equity holders some of which may affect our business legal position financial condition results of operations and liquidity failure by us an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or the vies to adequately manage the risks associated with such entities and any differences in views among us and other joint venture members or the thirdparty equity holders in the vies could 

prevent or delay actions that are in the best interest of us the joint venture or the vie and could have a material adverse effect on our or the applicable joint venture’s or vie’s financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions 

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent such future regulation is applicable to us 

legal governmental and regulatory risks 

legal regulatory and political matters and developments regarding climate change ghg or other air emissions fuel efficiency or the environment may decrease the demand for our petroleumbased products and could adversely affect our performance 

many state provincial and national governments across the world have imposed and may impose in the future increases in fuel economy standards lowcarbon fuel standards restrictions on vehicles using liquid fuel and other policies or regulations such as tariffs tax incentives or subsidies aimed at steering the public towards less petroleumdependent modes of transportation which could reduce demand for our liquid fuels for example in september 2020 the governor of california issued an executive order seeking to require that sales of all new passenger vehicles be zeroemission by 2035 and medium to heavyduty vehicles be zeroemission by 2045 where feasible the executive order also requires state agencies to build out sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure other us and governmental authorities across the world such as the uk and quebec have also announced similar plans andor restrictions with respect to the sale of new internal combustionengine vehicles 

the us federal government under the current presidential administration has also been aggressive in the scope magnitude and number of actions it has taken to regulate climate change and steer the public towards less petroleumdependent modes of transportation for instance shortly after taking office the current administration issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change as well as an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the previous administration additionally in april 2021 the epa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to reinstate california’s prior authority to set vehicle ghg emissions standards including standards that exceed or conflict with us federal standards in a parallel action finalized in december 2021 the national highway traffic administration nhtsa withdrew its previous regulatory determination in the safer affordable fuelefficient vehicles rule that california is preempted under the energy policy and conservation act from regulating fuel economy such authority could allow california to impose more stringent requirements on the use of our liquid fuels such as ev mandates and could potentially revive other states’ authority to adopt standards similar to california’s standards if the california waiver is reinstated and california adopts ghg emissions standards different than us federal standards then regardless of whether other us states adopt similar standards the size of the california auto market and the difficulty and expense of designing manufacturing and selling alternative vehicle fleets to comply with different standards such california standards could become the de facto national standard for vehicles sold for use in the us further in august 2021 nhtsa released a new proposed rule that would increase the current corporate average fuel economy cafe and carbon dioxide standards for certain passenger cars and light trucks under the previously adopted safer affordable fuelefficient 

vehicles rule higher cafe standards and fuel efficiency standards may reduce demand for our petroleumbased products in december 2021 the current us presidential administration issued an executive order that directs the us federal government to use its scale and procurement power to achieve a number of aspirational netzero emissions goals including among others 100 percent zeroemission vehicle acquisitions by 2035 and 100 percent zeroemission lightduty vehicle acquisitions by 2027 on december 30 2021 the epa finalized its “revised 2023 and later model year lightduty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards” in which the epa states that its final rule is projected to reduce gasoline consumption by more than 360 billion gallons by 2050 reaching a 15 percent reduction in annual us gasoline consumption in 2050 

moreover in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations un framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for ghgs became binding on all countries that had ratified it in 2015 the un climate change conference in paris resulted in the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 the terms of the paris agreement and the executive orders discussed above are expected to result in additional regulations or changes to existing regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our business in the us and the uk and that of our customers in addition incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources in many of the countries where we currently operate or may operate in the future could have a negative impact on our business across the world 

these and other legal regulatory political and international accord matters and developments regarding climate change ghg or other air emissions fuel efficiency or the environment including executive orders that mandate or encourage the use of alternative energy sources or discourage or ban the use of internal combustion engines may increase consumer preferences for and adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and decrease demand for our liquid fuels although they may also increase demand for our lowcarbon fuels these legal regulatory and political developments as well as other similarly focused laws and regulations such as among others the california and quebec capandtrade programs the uk emissions trading scheme the uk renewable transport fuel obligation and carb’s control measure for oceangoing vessels at berth rule could also result in increased costs or capital expenditures to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls at our facilities and iii administer and manage any emissions or blending programs including acquiring emission credits allowances or allotments 

many of these legal regulatory political and international accord matters and developments are subject to considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological and economic feasibility legal challenges and potential changes in law regulation or policy and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate effects of these matters and developments on us however a reduction in the demand for our products or an increase in costs or capital expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing events could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

compliance with or developments concerning the renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs and other regulations policies and standards impacting the demand for lowcarbon fuels could adversely affect our performance 

as described under “items 1 and 2 business and properties—our comprehensive liquid fuels strategy— regulations policies and standards driving lowcarbon fuel demand ” governments across the world have issued or are considering issuing lowcarbon fuel regulations policies and standards to help reduce ghg emissions and increase the percentage of low 

carbon fuels in the transportation fuel mix we strategically market our lowcarbon fuels based on regional policies feedstock preferences ci scores and our ability to obtain fuel pathways a significant portion of our lowcarbon fuels are sold in california canada and europe 

concerning the rfs on december 7 2021 the epa released a proposed rule to retroactively revise the 2020 rvos set overdue rvos for 2021 and 2022 and propose certain other changes to the rfs including among others changes to registration reporting recordkeeping and other requirements separately the epa proposed to deny more than 60 small refinery exemption sre petitions 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins lcfs credits and other credits as described in note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the future prices of rins lcfs credits or other credits prices for rins lcfs credits and other credits are dependent upon a variety of factors including as applicable epa regulations regulations of other countries and jurisdictions the availability of rins lcfs credits and other credits for purchase transportation fuel production levels which can vary significantly each quarter approved ci pathways and ci scores the ultimate outcome of the recently proposed rvos rfs changes and sre denials may also affect prices if an insufficient number of rins lcfs credits or other credits is available for purchase if we have to pay significantly higher prices for them or if we are otherwise unable to meet the epa’s rfs mandates or our other obligations under the renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected furthermore to the extent fewer sre waivers are granted in the future or rvo obligations are reallocated or increased the demand for and the price of rins may also increase and our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

in addition to the rfs and lcfs we operate in multiple jurisdictions that have issued or are considering issuing similar lowcarbon fuel regulations policies and standards the rfs lcfs and similar us state and international lowcarbon fuel regulations policies and standards are extremely complex often have different or conflicting requirements or methodologies and are frequently evolving requiring us to periodically update our systems and controls to maintain compliance and monitoring which could require significant expenditures and presents an increased risk of administrative error our lowcarbon fuels businesses could be materially and adversely affected if i these regulations policies and standards are adversely changed not enforced or discontinued ii the benefits therefrom are reduced such as the 45q tax credit the blender’s tax credit and other incentives iii any of the products we produce are deemed not to qualify for compliance therewith or iv we are unable to satisfy or maintain any approved pathways such changes could also negatively impact the economic assumptions and projections with respect to many of our lowcarbon projects and could have a material adverse impact on the timing of completion project returns and other outcomes with respect to such projects 

compliance with and changes in environmental health and safety laws could adversely affect our performance 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our refineries and plants as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes may have migrated the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air handling of waste and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the 

conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined sanctioned or enjoined 

because environmental health and safety laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental health and safety laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in increased difficulty in obtaining permits changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the products we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations discontinue use of certain process units or certain chemicals or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity we may also face liability for personal injury property damage natural resource damage environmental justice impacts or cleanup costs due to alleged contamination andor exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials such as various perfluorinated compounds per and polyfluoroalkyl substances benzene mtbe and petroleum hydrocarbons at or from our current and formerly owned facilities such liability or expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

climate change and “greenwashing” litigation could adversely affect our performance 

we could face increased climate‐related litigation with respect to our operations disclosures or products governments and private parties across the world such as california vermont and new york in the us and the netherlands in europe have filed lawsuits or initiated regulatory action against energy companies the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs seek damages andor abatement under various tort and other theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions additionally governments and private parties are also increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory action based on allegations that certain public statements regarding esgrelated matters and practices by companies are false and misleading “greenwashing” that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes similar issues can also arise relating to aspirational statements such as netzero or carbon neutrality targets that are made without an adequate basis to support such statements while we are currently not a party to any of these lawsuits they present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change or esg disclosures and practices 

any attempt by the us government to withdraw from reenter or materially modify any existing international trade agreements or enter into any new international trade agreements in the future could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

the previous us presidential administration questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements for example the administration withdrew the us from the transpacific partnership in addition the previous administration implemented and proposed various trade tariffs which resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on us goods changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment could adversely affect our business for example the imposition of tariffs or other international trade barriers could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products although there is currently uncertainty around the likelihood timing and details of many such actions if the current us administration takes 

action to withdraw from reenter or materially modify any existing international trade agreements or to enter into any new international trade agreements in the future our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes vat payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authorities although we believe we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in calculating our tax liabilities the final determination of these tax audits and any related proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty any adverse outcome of any of such tax audits or related proceedings could result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities that may individually or in the aggregate materially affect our cash tax liabilities and as a result our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control it is also possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties with any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could impact our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws including tax treaties or their interpretations 

the phaseout or replacement of the london interbank offered rate libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect financial markets and the interest rates we pay on any floatingrate debt 

on march 5 2021 the financial conduct authority in the uk issued an announcement on the future cessation or loss of representativeness of libor benchmark settings currently published by ice benchmark administration that announcement confirmed that libor would either cease to be provided by any administrator or would no longer be representative after december 31 2021 for all nonus dollar libor reference rates and for certain shortterm us dollar libor reference rates and after june 30 2023 for other reference rates in the future we may need to renegotiate our financial agreements including but not limited to our 40 billion revolving credit facility or incur other indebtedness and we may be required to select and use a replacement reference rate for such debt such replacement reference rate could include the secured overnight financing rate also known as sofr published by the federal reserve bank of new york the phaseout of libor or the use of any replacement reference rate may negatively impact the terms of and our ability to refinance such indebtedness and could also adversely affect the interest rate payable on and the liquidity and value of such indebtedness in addition the overall financial market and the ability to raise future indebtedness in a costeffective manner may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

cyber security and privacy related risks 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack including ransomware attacks which could result in i a loss of intellectual property proprietary 

information or employee customer or vendor data ii public disclosure of sensitive information iii increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging thirdparty experts and consultants iv systems interruption v disruption of our business operations vi remediation costs for repairs of system damage vii reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence and viii damage to our competitiveness the price of our common stock or debt securities and longterm stockholder value a breach could also originate from or compromise our customers’ vendors’ or other thirdparty networks outside of our control that could impact our business and operations as occurred with the colonial pipeline cybersecurity incident in may 2021 a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our stockholders employees customers vendors and governmental authorities us and international there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent technology systems breaches cyber and ransomware attacks or systems failures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity incidents has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention such as the directive issued by the us transportation security administration following the colonial pipeline cybersecurity incident to the extent we experience increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to comply therewith or incur fines for noncompliance 

increasing regulatory focus on data privacy and security issues and expanding or changing laws could expose us to increased liability subject us to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business we collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international provincial and local levels in many areas of our business including data privacy and security laws such as the california consumer privacy act ccpa the uk general data protection regulation gdpr and quebec’s recently enacted bill 64 bill 64 which amends the province’s main statute regulating the collection of information 

the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information requires that companies take certain actions including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us directly or indirectly from california residents the recently adopted california privacy rights act also expands the compliance requirements of and authority to enforce the ccpa as the interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa continues to evolve there may be a range of new compliance obligations and scrutiny with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

the gdpr applies to activities related to personal data that may be conducted by us directly or indirectly through vendors and subcontractors from an establishment in the uk the future of the gdpr remains in flux for political reasons as interpretations and enforcement of the gdpr evolve they could create a range of new compliance obligations which could cause us to incur additional costs those costs could become even more severe if interpretations or enforcement of the gdpr deviate in the future in both cases failure to comply could result in significant penalties of up to a maximum of 4 percent of our global turnover that may materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and liquidity our business and operations may also be impacted if the uk parliament approves new standard contractual clauses sccs for the international transfer of personal data outside of 

the uk if adopted on march 21 2022 the new sccs may apply to our existing contracts involving the international transfer of personal data that is restricted under the gdpr requiring us to renegotiate any nonconforming contracts by september 21 2022 which could be expensive and could divert senior management’s attention from our business 

bill 64 which was adopted in september 2021 is intended to modify the obligations of public bodies and private sector enterprises by modernizing the framework applicable to the protection of personal information most provisions of bill 64 will take effect over the course of the next three years with some provisions taking effect in september 2022 bill 64 largely focuses on increasing the number of individual privacy rights and imposes a range of compliance and procedural obligations with the possibility for significant penalties and private rights of action for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

the ccpa the gdpr and bill 64 as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to us pose increasingly complex compliance challenges as well as monitoring and control obligations that could raise our costs and place increased demand on company resources any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us further if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with these laws and regulations we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result 

general risk factors 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business counterparties 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if rating agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs may increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility intended to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

severe weather events such as storms hurricanes droughts or floods could have an adverse effect on our operations and could increase our costs for instance severe weather events can have an impact on crops production and reduce the supply of or increase our costs to obtain feedstocks for our ethanol and renewable diesel segments if climate changes result in more intense or frequent severe weather events the physical and disruptive effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations and assets 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

certain employees at five of our us refineries as well as at each of our canadian and uk refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements which generally have unique and independent expiration dates to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action at our facilities or at facilities owned or operated by third parties that support our operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity in addition future us federal state or international labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we need or at acceptable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we incur a significant loss or liability for which we are not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events

impact of the covid19 pandemic to our business 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business although we experienced improvements in our business in 2021 compared to the significant negative effects from the pandemic in 2020 the longterm implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and financial position remain uncertain information about the uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic on our business is discussed in item 1a risk factors — the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the related events and circumstances have had and may continue to have negative impacts on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity and those of our customers suppliers and other counterparties” and note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

overview and outlook 

overview 

business operations update 

our business continued to recover throughout 2021 after experiencing significant negative effects from a decrease in demand and market prices for most of our products in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the outbreak of covid19 and its development into a pandemic in march 2020 disrupted the global economy and significantly reduced the demand and market prices for most of our products primarily gasoline and diesel however by mid2020 we began experiencing increased demand and higher market prices for most of our products and these improvements continued throughout 2021 along with the ongoing recovery of the global economy as worldwide efforts to address the virus progressed including the development and distribution of multiple covid19 vaccines and therapeutics gasoline and diesel demand returned to prepandemic levels during 2021 in most of the regions where we operate and at times during 2021 we experienced demand for diesel in excess of prepandemic levels jet fuel demand also improved in 2021 although at a slower pace than other products we produce relative to prepandemic levels these improvements in demand and an associated increase in refining margins were primary contributors to us reporting 930 million of net income attributable to valero stockholders for the year ended december 31 2021 our operating results for 2021 including operating results by segment are described in the following summary and detailed descriptions can be found below under “results of operations” 

our improved 2021 results however were negatively impacted by estimated excess energy costs of 579 million 467 million after taxes as a result of a significant increase in the cost of electricity and natural gas at certain of our refineries and ethanol plants arising out of winter storm uri in february 2021 in addition our operations were negatively impacted by hurricane ida in august 2021 which caused us to shut down two refineries and our renewable diesel plant in louisiana in preparation for the storm although the refineries and the plant sustained minimal damage from the hurricane we were delayed from restarting operations until electrical supply and other utilities were restored and from shipping product to our customers until the mississippi river was reopened to ship and barge traffic 

as a result of our improved business and overall market conditions our operations generated 59 billion of cash in 2021 which included the receipt of our 2020 us federal income tax refund of 962 million in may 2021 this cash was used to make 25 billion of capital investments in our business and return 16 billion to our stockholders through dividend payments in addition we reduced our longterm debt by 13 billion in 2021 through a series of debt reduction and refinancing transactions as described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements as a result of this and other activity our cash and cash equivalents increased by 809 million during 2021 from 33 billion as of december 31 2020 to 41 billion as of december 31 2021 we had 93 billion in liquidity as of december 31 2021 the components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows capital investments and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found below under “liquidity and capital resources” 

results for the year ended december 31 2021 

for 2021 we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders of 930 million compared to a net loss attributable to valero stockholders of 14 billion for 2020 the increase of 24 billion was primarily due to higher operating income of 37 billion partially offset by higher income tax expense of 12 billion the details of our operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss by segment and in total are reflected below adjusted operating income loss excludes the adjustments reflected in the tables in note e on page 51 



while our operating income increased by 37 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 adjusted operating income increased by 36 billion primarily due to the following 

• refining segment refining segment adjusted operating income increased by 31 billion primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate primarily diesel margins and higher throughput volumes partially offset by the higher cost of compliance credits lower discounts on crude oils and estimated excess energy costs arising from winter storm uri 

• renewable diesel segment renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by 74 million primarily due to higher renewable diesel prices and higher sales volumes partially offset by higher feedstock costs an unfavorable impact from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities and higher operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense 

• ethanol segment ethanol segment adjusted operating income increased by 558 million primarily due to higher ethanol and corn related coproduct prices and higher production volumes partially offset by higher corn prices and estimated excess energy costs arising from winter storm uri 

outlook 

as previously discussed many uncertainties remain with respect to the covid19 pandemic and while it is difficult to predict the ultimate economic impacts that the pandemic will have on us and how quickly we can or ultimately will fully recover once the pandemic subsides we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2022 

• gasoline and diesel demand has returned to prepandemic levels and is expected to follow typical seasonal patterns jet fuel demand continues to improve slowly but remains below prepandemic levels 

• sour crude oil discounts are expected to continue to improve as opec increases its production of sour crude oils in response to anticipated continued growth in global crude oil demand 

• renewable diesel margins are expected to moderate from the levels achieved in 2021 following the startup of the expansion of the dgd plant in the fourth quarter of 2021 renewable diesel production capacity increased by 410 million gallons per year from 290 million gallons to 700 million gallons per year 

• ethanol margins are expected to decline from the record high levels achieved in 2021 as ethanol inventory levels rise throughout the us market

the following table includes selected financial data for the total company corporate and other for 2021 and 2020 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables unless otherwise noted 



revenues increased by 491 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in the product prices of the petroleumbased transportation fuels associated with sales made by our refining segment this increase in revenues was partially offset by an increase in cost of materials and other of 438 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs higher operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense of 13 billion which includes the impact of estimated excess energy costs of 532 million arising out of winter storm uri and an increase in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense of 109 million primarily due to an increase in certain employee compensation expenses of 69 million higher advertising expenses of 15 million and higher charitable contributions of 12 million the increase in cost of materials and other was partially offset by the favorable effect from a 224 million lifo liquidation adjustment in 2020 

these changes resulted in a 37 billion increase in operating income from an operating loss of 16 billion in 2020 to operating income of 21 billion in 2021 

adjusted operating income increased by 36 billion from an adjusted operating loss of 13 billion in 2020 to adjusted operating income of 23 billion in 2021 the components of this 36 billion increase in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analyses that follow 

“other income net” decreased by 116 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a charge of 193 million from the early redemption and retirement of debt and an asset impairment loss of 24 million resulting from the cancellation of a pipeline extension project by our nonconsolidated joint venture diamond pipeline llc partially offset by the gain of 62 million on the sale of a 2499 percent membership interest in mvp terminalling llc mvp these items occurred in 2021 and are more fully described in note c 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” increased by 40 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the effect of 2021 reflecting a full year of interest expense associated with 40 billion aggregate principal amount of debt we issued in public debt offerings in 2020 see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income tax expense increased by 12 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of higher income before income tax expense in addition the increase in income tax expense was impacted by a 64 million charge which resulted from certain statutory tax rate changes in 2021 as discussed in note d as well as a higher benefit in 2020 of 304 million associated with the us federal tax net operating loss for 2020 which was carried back to 2015 when the us federal statutory rate was 35 percent see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these tax matters 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 44 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher earnings associated with dgd a consolidated joint venture see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our accounting for dgd 

refining segment results 

the following table includes selected financial and operating data of our refining segment for 2021 and 2020 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables unless otherwise noted 



refining segment operating income increased by 32 billion in 2021 however refining segment adjusted operating income which excludes the adjustments in the table in note e increased by 31 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 the components of this increase in the adjusted results along with the reasons for the changes in those components are outlined below 

• refining segment margin increased by 42 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 

refining segment margin is primarily affected by the prices of the petroleumbased transportation fuels that we sell and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we process the table on page 44 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2021 compared to 2020 

the increase in refining segment margin was primarily due to the following 

◦ an increase in gasoline margins had a favorable impact of approximately 38 billion 

◦ an increase in distillate primarily diesel margins had a favorable impact of approximately 17 billion 

◦ an increase in throughput volumes of 232000 bpd had a favorable impact of approximately 766 million as noted above in “overview and outlook— overview —business operations update” we continued to recover from the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic throughout 2021 and have increased production of most of our products at our refineries to align with improvements in demand 

◦ an increase in the cost of credits primarily rins needed to comply with the renewable and lowcarbon fuels blending programs had an unfavorable impact of 13 billion 

◦ lower discounts on crude oils had an unfavorable impact of approximately 710 million 

• refining segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased by 11 billion primarily due to higher energy costs of 845 million which includes the effect of estimated excess energy costs arising out of winter storm uri of 478 million see note a and an increase in certain employee compensation expenses of 138 million 

renewable diesel segment results 

the following table includes selected financial and operating data of our renewable diesel segment for 2021 and 2020 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables unless otherwise noted 



renewable diesel segment operating income increased by 71 million in 2021 however renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income which excludes the adjustment in the table in note e increased by 74 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the components of this increase in the adjusted results along with the reasons for the changes in those components are outlined below 

• renewable diesel segment margin increased by 137 million in 2021 compared to 2020 

renewable diesel segment margin is primarily affected by the price of the renewable diesel that we sell and the cost of the feedstocks that we process the table on page 45 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our renewable diesel segment margin in 2021 compared to 2020 

the increase in renewable diesel segment margin was primarily due to the following 

◦ higher renewable diesel prices had a favorable impact of approximately 768 million 

◦ an increase in sales volumes of 227000 gallons per day had a favorable impact of approximately 202 million the increase in sales volume was primarily due to the additional production capacity resulting from the expansion of the dgd plant that commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 

◦ an increase in the cost of the feedstocks we process had an unfavorable impact of approximately 731 million 

◦ price risk management activities had an unfavorable impact of 80 million we recognized a hedge loss of 46 million in 2021 compared to a hedge gain of 34 million in 2020 

• renewable diesel segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased by 49 million primarily due to higher chemical and catalyst costs of 14 million 

higher outside services of 11 million an increase in certain employee compensation expenses of 11 million and higher energy costs of 4 million 

ethanol segment results 

the following table includes selected financial and operating data of our ethanol segment for 2021 and 2020 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables unless otherwise noted 



ethanol segment operating income increased by 542 million in 2021 however ethanol segment adjusted operating income which excludes the adjustments in the table in note e increased by 558 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the components of this increase in the adjusted results along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below 

• ethanol segment margin increased by 700 million in 2021 compared to 2020 

ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by prices of the ethanol and corn related coproducts that we sell and the cost of corn that we process the table on page 45 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our ethanol segment margin in 2021 compared to 2020 

the increase in ethanol segment margin was primarily due to the following 

◦ higher ethanol prices had a favorable impact of approximately 14 billion 

◦ higher prices on the coproducts that we produce primarily ddgs had a favorable impact of approximately 270 million 

◦ an increase in production volumes of 361000 gallons per day had a favorable impact of approximately 114 million as noted above in “overview and outlook— overview —business operations update” we continued to recover from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic throughout 2021 and have increased the aggregate production of ethanol across our plants to align with improvements in demand 

◦ higher corn prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately 11 billion 

• ethanol segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased by 150 million primarily due to higher energy costs which includes the effect of estimated excess energy costs arising out of winter storm uri of 54 million see note a 

 

the following notes relate to references on pages 42 through 50 

a in midfebruary 2021 many of our refineries and plants were impacted to varying extents by the severe cold utility disruptions and higher energy costs arising out of winter storm uri the higher energy costs resulted from an increase in the prices of natural gas and electricity that significantly exceeded rates that we consider normal such as the average rates we incurred the month preceding the storm as a result our operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 includes estimated excess energy costs of 579 million 

the abovementioned pretax estimated excess energy charge is reflected in our statement of income line items and attributable to our reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2021 as follows in millions 



b cost of materials and other for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a charge of 224 million related to the liquidation of lifo inventory layers attributable to our refining and ethanol segments our inventory levels decreased throughout 2020 due to lower production resulting from lower demand for our products caused by the negative economic impacts of covid19 on our business as a result our inventory levels at december 31 2020 were below their december 31 2019 levels of the 224 million charge recognized for the year ended december 31 2020 222 million and 2 million is attributable to our refining and ethanol segments respectively 

c “other income net” for the year ended december 31 2021 includes the following 

• a gain of 62 million on the sale of a 2499 percent membership interest in mvp a nonconsolidated joint venture with a subsidiary of magellan midstream partners lp for 270 million 

• a charge of 24 million representing our portion of the asset impairment loss recognized by diamond pipeline llc a nonconsolidated joint venture with a subsidiary of plains all american pipeline lp resulting from the joint venture’s cancellation of its pipeline extension project and 

• a charge of 193 million from the early redemption and retirement of approximately 21 billion aggregate principal amount of various series of our senior notes during the year ended december 31 2021 

d certain statutory income tax rate changes primarily an increase in the uk rate from 19 percent to 25 percent effective in 2023 were enacted during the year ended december 31 2021 that resulted in the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities under gaap we are required to recognize the effect of a change in tax law in the period of enactment as a result we recognized deferred income tax expense of 64 million during the year ended december 31 2021 which represents the net increase in our deferred tax liabilities resulting from the changes in the tax rates 

e we use certain financial measures as noted below that are not defined under gaap and are considered to be nongaap financial measures 

we have defined these nongaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements including industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable gaap measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under gaap in addition these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently which diminishes their utility 

nongaap financial measures are as follows 

• refining margin is defined as refining segment operating income loss excluding the lifo liquidation adjustment the lcm inventory valuation adjustment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



• renewable diesel margin is defined as renewable diesel segment operating income excluding operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



• ethanol margin is defined as ethanol segment operating income loss excluding the lifo liquidation adjustment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



• adjusted refining operating income loss is defined as refining segment operating income loss excluding the lifo liquidation adjustment the lcm inventory valuation adjustment and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



• adjusted renewable diesel operating income is defined as renewable diesel segment operating income excluding other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



• adjusted ethanol operating income loss is defined as ethanol segment operating income loss excluding the changes in estimated useful lives of two of our ethanol plants the lifo liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



• adjusted operating income loss is defined as total company operating income loss excluding the lifo liquidation adjustment the lcm inventory valuation adjustment the changes in estimated useful lives of two of our ethanol plants and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



f we use throughput volumes sales volumes and production volumes for the refining segment renewable diesel segment and ethanol segment respectively due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our liquidity was positively impacted by the cash generated by our operations in 2021 notwithstanding the lingering impacts of the covid19 pandemic excess energy costs arising out of winter storm uri and the effects of hurricane ida as described in “ overview and outlook — overview — business operations update” 

we completed debt reduction and refinancing transactions in 2021 that reduced our longterm debt by 13 billion our refinancing transactions included the issuance of 500 million of 2800 percent senior notes due december 1 2031 and 950 million of 3650 percent senior notes due december 1 2051 proceeds from these issuances and cash on hand were used to repurchase and retire or redeem approximately 21 billion of various series of our senior notes in addition we redeemed our 575 million floating rate senior notes due september 15 2023 

in february 2022 we completed additional debt reduction and refinancing transactions that reduced our longterm debt by an additional 750 million these additional refinancing transactions included the issuance of 650 million of 4000 percent senior notes due june 1 2052 proceeds from this issuance and cash on hand were used to repurchase and retire approximately 14 billion of various series of our senior notes 

our liquidity 

our liquidity consisted of the following as of december 31 2021 in millions 



 

a excludes the committed facilities of the consolidated vies 

b the amount for our canadian revolver is shown in us dollars as set forth in the summary of our credit facilities in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements the availability under our canadian revolver as of december 31 2021 in canadian dollars was c145 million 

c excludes 36 million of cash and cash equivalents related to the consolidated vies that is available for use only by the vies 

information about our outstanding borrowings letters of credit issued and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase as of december 31 2021 all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt including debt guaranteed by us were at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

we believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

cash flows 

components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021

of other financing activities and increase our available cash on hand by 809 million the debt issuances borrowings and repayments are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

as previously noted our operations generated 59 billion of cash in 2021 driven primarily by noncash charges to income of 23 billion a positive change in working capital of 22 billion and net income of 13 billion noncash charges primarily included 24 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and a 193 million loss on the early redemption and retirement of debt partially offset by a 126 million deferred income tax benefit and a 62 million gain on the sale of a partial interest in mvp as described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements details regarding the components of the change in working capital along with the reasons for the changes in those components are described in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition see “results of operations” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income 

our investing activities of 22 billion consisted of 25 billion in capital investments as defined below under “capital investments” of which 10 billion related to selffunded capital investments by dgd and 110 million related to capital expenditures of vies other than dgd partially offset by 270 million of proceeds received from the sale of a partial interest in mvp as described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financing activities of 15 billion consisted primarily of 16 billion in dividend payments and 27 million for the purchase of common stock for treasury in connection with stockbased compensation plans partially offset by 189 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020

as previously noted our operations generated 948 million of cash in 2020 which resulted from noncash charges to income of 24 billion partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of 345 million noncash charges primarily included 24 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and 158 million of deferred income tax expense the change in working capital was affected primarily by a 740 million use of cash 4 resulting from the rapid decline in market prices of refined petroleum products and crude oil as a result of the negative economic effects of the covid19 pandemic that impacted our receivables and accounts payable this use of cash along with other uses of cash were partially offset by a 10 billion source of cash driven by a reduction in inventory levels on hand details regarding the components of the change in working capital along with the reasons for the changes in those components are described in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition see “results of operations” for an analysis of the significant components of our net loss 

our investing activities of 24 billion consisted of 25 billion in capital investments of which 548 million related to selffunded capital investments by dgd and 251 million related to capital expenditures of vies other than dgd 

4 represents the net cash flow change in “receivables net” of 33 billion and accounts payable of 41 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 as described in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financing activities of 20 billion consisted primarily of 16 billion in dividend payments 208 million to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests and 156 million for the purchase of common stock for treasury 

our capital resources 

our material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 primarily consist of working capital requirements capital investments contractual obligations and other matters as described below our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements 

capital investments 

capital investments are comprised of our capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows as shown on page 75  capital investments exclude strategic investments or acquisitions if any 

we also identify our capital investments by the nature of the project with which the expenditure is associated as follows 

• sustaining capital investments are generally associated with projects that are expected to extend the lives of our property assets sustain their operating capabilities and safety including deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures or comply with regulatory requirements regulatory compliance capital investments are generally associated with projects that are incurred to comply with governmental regulatory requirements such as requirements to reduce emissions and prohibited elements from our products 

• growth capital investments  including lowcarbon growth capital investments that support the development and growth of our lowcarbon renewable diesel and ethanol businesses are generally associated with projects for the construction of new property assets that are expected to enhance our profitability and cashgenerating capabilities including investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures 

we have developed an extensive multiyear capital investment program which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors the following table reflects our expected capital investments for the year ending december 31 2022 by nature of the project and reportable segment along with historical amounts for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions the following table also reflects capital investments attributable to valero which is a nongaap measure that we define and reconcile to capital investments below under “capital investments attributable to valero” 



 

a all expected amounts for the year ending december 31 2022 exclude capital expenditures that the consolidated vies other than dgd may incur because we do not operate those vies 

b capital investments attributable to valero by nature of the project are as follows in millions 



we have publicly announced ghg emissions reductionoffset targets for 2025 and 2035 we believe that our expected allocation of growth capital into lowercarbon projects is consistent with such targets certain of these lowercarbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2022 our capital investments in future years to achieve these targets are expected to include investments associated with certain lowercarbon projects currently at various stages of progress evaluation or approval see “items 1 and 2 business and properties—our comprehensive liquid fuels strategy— our lowcarbon projects ” for a description of our lowcarbon projects 

capital investments attributable to valero 

capital investments attributable to valero is a nongaap financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures excluding the portion of dgd’s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated vies 

we are a 50 percent joint venture member in dgd and consolidate its financial statements as a result all of dgd’s net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities dgd’s members use dgd’s operating cash flow excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves because dgd’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member only 50 percent of dgd’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments we also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other vies that we consolidate because we do not operate those vies see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about the vies that we consolidate we believe capital investments attributable to valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments 

capital investments attributable to valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments which is the most comparable gaap measure nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under gaap in addition this nongaap measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently which may diminish its utility 



contractual obligations

• the 300 million of 400 percent gulf opportunity zone revenue bonds series 2010 go zone bonds are due december 1 2040 but they are subject to mandatory tender on june 1 2022 the mandatory tender date at a price equal to par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the mandatory tender date however we have the option to effectuate a remarketing of these bonds and we currently expect to remarket them effective on or soon after the mandatory tender date or otherwise refinance them but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so 

• the ienova revolver as defined and described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements is subject to repayment on demand however we do not expect the lender to demand repayment during the next 12 months 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase program 

on january 23 2018 our board authorized the 2018 program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2021 we had 14 billion available for purchase under the 2018 program which has no expiration date we have not purchased any shares of our common stock under the 2018 program since midmarch 2020 and we will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate we have no obligation to make purchases under this program 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute 116 million to our pension plans and 22 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2022 see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of many of our products because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities 

tax matters 

during 2020 we deferred payment on 250 million of valueadded and motor fuel taxes that were otherwise due in 2020 as permitted by various taxing authorities to help companies address the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic we paid 220 million of the deferred amount in 2021 and the remaining 30 million in january 2022 

cash held by our foreign subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2021 33 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us without any us federal income tax consequences on dividends but certain other taxes may apply including but not limited to withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions us state income taxes and us federal income tax on foreign exchange gains therefore there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us however we have accrued for withholding taxes and us state income taxes on a portion of the cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries and we believe that the remaining cost is not material to our financial position and liquidity 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions including the uncertainties concerning the covid19 pandemic and volatility in the global crude oil markets however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable see also “item 1a risk factors—risks related to our business industry and operations— legal regulatory and political matters and developments regarding climate change ghg or other air emissions fuel efficiency or the environment may decrease the demand for our petroleumbased products and could adversely affect our performance ” 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

unrecognized tax benefits 

we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that ultimately may not be allowed by the relevant taxing authorities when we take such positions we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions if any that should be recognized in our financial statements tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained 

the evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations these judgments and 

estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the progress of ongoing tax audits case law and changes in legislation 

details of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits are included in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets primarily property plant and equipment are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a longlived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition if a longlived asset is not recoverable an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated such estimates include but are not limited to assumptions about future sales volumes commodity prices operating costs margins the use or disposition of the asset the asset’s estimated remaining useful life and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential in light of existing and expected regulations due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings 

as of december 31 2021 we determined there was no impairment of our longlived assets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of feedstocks primarily crude oil waste and renewable feedstocks and corn the products we produce and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including futures and options to manage the volatility of 

• inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels determined on a lifo basis differ from our previous yearend lifo inventory levels and 

• forecasted purchases andor product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the amount of gain or loss that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price for all of our commodity derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk was not material see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2021 

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with the renewable and lowcarbon fuel blending programs to manage this risk we enter into contracts to purchase these credits as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these blending programs 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments dollars in millions the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our debt

b see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources— our capital resources —contractual obligations” for a discussion of the mandatory tender date and maturity date of our go zone bonds 

c our floating rate debt included outstanding borrowings under the dgd revolver the dgd loan agreement and the ienova revolver each as defined and described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements the respective lenders of these debt instruments do not have recourse against us 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our foreign operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local functional currencies of those operations to manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations we often use foreign currency contracts as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of our foreign currency contracts was not material

environmental stewardship 

our goals 

we strive to manage our business to responsibly meet the world’s demand for reliable and affordable energy and have made multibilliondollar investments to develop and grow our lowcarbon renewable diesel and ethanol businesses these renewable fuels businesses have made us one of the world’s largest renewable fuels producers even so we continually seek to find ways to reduce the environmental impact of all of our operations and improve our esg practices 

renewable fuels 

we have invested over 3 billion 2 to date in our renewable fuels businesses and we expect additional growth opportunities in this area for example we expect to invest almost 2 billion 3 over the next three years to complete the expansion of dgd’s existing renewable diesel plant located next to our st charles refinery in norco louisiana the dgd plant and to build dgd’s second plant next to our port arthur refinery in port arthur texas see “valero’s operations— renewable diesel ” for additional information about the expansion of our renewable diesel business 

we believe that the growth of our renewable fuels businesses not only provides a good business opportunity but it is also an opportunity for us to produce fuels that reduce carbon emissions renewable diesel and ethanol are lowcarbon transportation fuels that have the potential to result in meaningful reductions in life cycle carbon emissions compared to traditional diesel and nonblended gasoline blending and credits with respect to renewable fuels may also help offset greenhouse gas ghg emissions additionally many state provincial and national governments across the world have implemented or are considering implementing lowcarbon fuel policies and stricter fuel efficiency standards to help reach ghg emissions reduction targets this has helped and should continue to help drive the demand for both renewable diesel and ethanol and we believe that our ability to supply these renewable fuels could play an important role in helping achieve such ghg emissions reduction targets 

reports 

we publish and make available on our website various climaterelated reports and presentations these include 

• our presentation providing an esg overview of our company 

• our sasb report which aligns valero’s performance data with the recommendations of the sasb framework in the oil and gas – refining and marketing industry standard

renewable diesel 

our relationship with dgd 

dgd is a joint venture that we consolidate we entered into the dgd joint venture in 2011 see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference regarding our accounting for dgd we operate the dgd plant and perform certain management functions for dgd as an independent contractor under an agreement with dgd 

renewable diesel plant 

the dgd plant is located next to our st charles refinery in norco louisiana and its production capacity is 290 million gallons of renewable diesel per year renewable diesel is a lowcarbon transportation fuel that is interchangeable with diesel produced from petroleum and is produced from rendered and recycled materials including animal fats used cooking oils and other vegetable oils 

dgd began an expansion of the dgd plant in 2019 which is expected to increase its renewable diesel production by 400 million gallons per year construction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 additionally in january 2021 we and our joint venture partner approved the construction of a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant to be located next to our port arthur refinery in port arthur texas the new plant is expected to increase dgd’s total renewable diesel production capacity to almost 12 billion gallons per year 

the dgd plant receives rendered and recycled materials primarily by rail and trucks owned by third parties dgd is party to a raw material supply agreement with darling under which darling is obligated to offer to dgd a portion of its feedstock requirements at competitive pricing but dgd is not obligated to purchase all or any part of its feedstock from darling therefore dgd pursues the lowest cost feedstock supply available see item 1a “risk factors”—risks related to our business industry and operations— our investments in joint ventures and other entities decrease our ability to manage risk  and— disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil rendered and recycled materials corn and other feedstocks could adversely affect our operations  which are incorporated herein by reference 

marketing 

dgd’s renewable diesel is sold under the diamond green diesel® brand primarily to refiners to be blended with petroleumbased diesel renewable diesel is also sold to end users for use in their operations dgd sells renewable diesel domestically and exports renewable diesel into global markets primarily canada and europe renewable diesel is distributed primarily by rail and ships owned by third parties see item 1a “risk factors”—risks related to our business industry and operations— developments with respect to lowcarbon fuel policies and the market for alternative fuels may affect demand for our renewable fuels and could adversely affect our financial performance which is incorporated herein by reference 

ethanol 

ethanol plants 

our ethanol business began in 2009 with the purchase of our first ethanol plants we have since grown the business by purchasing additional ethanol plants our 13 ethanol plants are located in the midcontinent region of the us and they have a combined ethanol production capacity of 169 billion gallons per year our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities that process corn to produce ethanol and various coproducts including livestock feed dry distillers grains or ddgs and syrup and inedible corn oil 

the following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants their annual production capacities for ethanol in millions of gallons and ddgs in tons and their annual corn processing capacities in millions of bushels 



the foregoing table excludes data relating to our riga michigan ethanol plant which ceased operations in 2020 

we source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators we publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to facilitate corn supply transactions our plants receive corn primarily by rail and truck 

marketing 

we sell our ethanol primarily to refiners and gasoline blenders under term and spot contracts in bulk markets such as new york chicago the us gulf coast florida and the us west coast we also export our ethanol into the global markets we distribute our ethanol primarily by rail including some railcars owned by us and thirdparty trucks barges and vessels we sell ddgs primarily to animal feed customers in the us mexico and asia which are transported primarily by thirdparty rail trucks and vessels 

seasonality 

demand for gasoline diesel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction the demand for renewable diesel has not significantly fluctuated by season ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline and as a result ethanol demand typically moves in line with the demand for gasoline 

government regulations 

we incorporate by reference into this item the disclosures on government regulations including environmental regulations contained in the following sections of this report 

• item 1a “risk factors”—risks related to our business industry and operations— legal technological and political developments and evolving market sentiment regarding fuel efficiency and lowcarbon fuel standards may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our performance 

• item 1a “risk factors”—legal governmental and regulatory risks and 

• item 3 “legal proceedings”—environmental enforcement matters 

capital expenditures attributable to compliance with government regulations  in 2020 our capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were 27 million and they are currently estimated to be 13 million for 2021 and 24 million for 2022 the estimates for 2021 and 2022 do not include amounts related to capital investments at our refineries and plants that management has deemed to be strategic investments these amounts could materially change as a result of governmental and regulatory actions we have incurred significant capital expenditures in prior years to comply with government regulations however we do not believe that compliance with government regulations including environmental regulations had a material effect on our capital expenditures in 2020 and we currently do not expect that compliance with these regulations will have material effects on our capital expenditures in 2021 

other  because our business is heavily regulated our costs for compliance with government regulations are significant especially costs associated with environmental compliance programs which are further disclosed in notes 20 and 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 

human capital 

we believe that our employees provide a competitive advantage for our success we seek to foster a culture that supports diversity and inclusion and we strive to provide a safe healthy and rewarding work environment with opportunities for professional growth and longterm financial stability 

headcount 

on january 31 2021 we had 9964 employees these employees were located in the following countries 



of our total employees as of january 31 2021 1768 were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements and 9803 were in permanent fulltime positions see also item 1a “risk factors”—general risk factors —our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators  

safety 

we believe that safety and reliability are extremely important not only to the cultural values we aspire to as a company but also for operational success as a decrease in the number of employee safety events and process safety events should generally reduce unplanned shutdowns and increase the operational reliability of our plants this in turn should also translate into fewer environmental incidents a safer workplace lower environmental impacts and better community relations we strive to improve safety and reliability by offering yearround safety training programs for our employees and contractors and by seeking to promote the same expectations and culture of safety among all of our workers we also seek to enhance our safety compliance by conducting audits quality assurance visits and comprehensive risk assessments 

in assessing safety performance we measure our annual total recordable incident rate trir which includes data with respect to our employees and contractors and is defined as the number of recordable injuries per 200000 working hours we also annually measure our tier 1 process safety event rate which is a metric defined by the american petroleum institute that looks at process safety events per 200000 total employee and contractor working hours we use these measures and believe they are helpful in assessing our safety performance because they evaluate performance relative to the numbers of hours being worked these metrics are also used by others in our industry which allows for a more objective comparison of our performance in 2020 our employee and contractor trir was 034 and 015 respectively and our tier 1 process safety event rate was 006 as a result in 2020 we had one of our best years ever in terms of safety performance 

compensation and benefits 

we believe that it is important to provide our employees with competitive compensation and benefits the benefits we offer to employees depending on work location and eligibility status include among others healthcare plans that are generally available to all employees extended sick leave newparent leave access to financial planning programs to support dual working parents at different stages of their careers 

caregiver support networks including an onsite child care center at our headquarters and support for children and parents with disabilities a company 401k matching program a companysponsored pension plan onsite employee wellness centers also available to eligible dependents at our headquarters tuition reimbursement programs fitness center access or a stipend and employee recognition programs 

we believe that it is important to reward employee performance and have an annual bonus program that rewards achievements of various operational financial and strategic objectives while such objectives include more typical financial performance metrics such as earnings per share and cash operating expenses we believe esg performance is also important and our annual bonus program rewards achievements in areas such as sustainability diversity and inclusion compliance and corporate citizenship

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities 

risks related to covid19 

the outbreak of covid19 has had and may continue to have material adverse consequences for general economic financial and business conditions and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity and those of our customers suppliers and other counterparties 

the outbreak of covid19 and the responses of governmental authorities and companies as well as the selfimposed restrictions by many individuals across the world to stem the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity as a result there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of businesses open for operation and substantially fewer people across the world have been traveling to work or leaving their homes to procure or provide goods and services this has resulted for example in a dramatic reduction in airline flights and has reduced the number of cars on the road as a result there has been a decline in the demand for and thus also the market prices of crude oil and certain of our products particularly the refined petroleum products that we manufacture and sell 

concerns over the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic on economic and business prospects across the world have contributed to increased market and crude oil price volatility and have diminished expectations for the global economy these factors coupled with the emergence of decreasing business and consumer confidence and increasing unemployment resulting from the covid19 outbreak and the increase in crude oil price volatility have precipitated an economic slowdown the current economic slowdown and period of depressed prices for crude oil and most of our products has had and may continue to have significant adverse consequences on our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other counterparties this has also had and may continue to have a 

negative effect on our liquidity and our ability to obtain adequate crude oil volumes and other feedstock supplies and to market certain of our products at favorable prices or at all 

declines in the market prices of crude oil other feedstocks and products below their carrying values in our inventory have required and may continue to require us to make certain valuation adjustments eg lower of cost or market lcm inventory valuation adjustments to write down the value of our inventories this has in turn had and may continue to have a negative impact on our operating income the decline in the price of the refined products we sell and the feedstocks we purchase has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on other areas of our business and results of operation such as our revenues and cost of sales in addition a sustained period of low crude oil prices such as we experienced in 2020 may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business such conditions could also result in an increased risk that customers lenders service and insurance providers and other counterparties such as counterparties to our commodity hedging or derivative instruments or other agreements vital to our operations may be unable to fully fulfil their obligations in a timely manner or at all any of the foregoing events or conditions or other unforeseen consequences of covid19 could significantly adversely affect our business and financial condition and the business and financial condition of our customers suppliers and other counterparties 

while in the latter part of the second quarter of 2020 certain governmental authorities in the us and abroad began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of covid19 which resulted in an increase in the demand and market prices for most of our products relative to what we experienced during the first several months of the pandemic developments with respect to covid19 have been occurring at a rapid pace and the risk remains that circumstances could change for instance many locations where restrictions were lifted and others where the restrictions were more moderately lifted such as california in our us west coast region and new york canada and the uk in our north atlantic region have experienced a resurgence in the spread of covid19 prompting many governmental authorities to reimpose certain restrictions that had previously been lifted or softened in addition in december 2020 the us food and drug administration fda and canadian and uk regulators each granted emergencyuse authorization for multiple covid19 vaccines to be used as immunization against the virus although these vaccines may be seen as a key factor in helping to restore public confidence and thus stimulate and increase economic activity potentially to prepandemic levels they may not be distributed widely on a timely basis and they may not be effective against new variants of the covid19 virus 

many uncertainties remain with respect to covid19 including its resulting economic effects and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from covid19 on our business and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic subsides the timing or effectiveness of vaccine distributions the potential for new variants of the virus or whether any recovery will ultimately experience a reversal or other setbacks the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments particularly within the geographic areas where we operate and the related impact on overall economic activity all of which are currently unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time however the adverse impacts of the economic effects from the covid19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the global oil markets on our business have been and will likely continue to be significant 

the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity have also had and may continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the other risk factors below as those risk factors are amended or supplemented by 

subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q and other reports and documents we file with the us sec after the date of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

risks related to our business industry and operations 

our financial results are affected by volatile margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil corn and other feedstocks and the market price at which we can sell our products 

our financial results are affected by the relationship or margin between our product prices and the prices for crude oil corn and other feedstocks historically refining and ethanol margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil corn other feedstocks gasoline diesel other refined petroleum products and renewable products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls has also had and may continue to have a significant impact on the market prices of crude oil and certain of our products 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on product margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil corn or all of our other feedstocks and must purchase all of the feedstocks we process we generally purchase our feedstocks long before we process them and sell the resulting products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the resulting products has had and in the future could continue to have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices as was experienced during much of 2020 negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining renewable diesel and ethanol margins also can be significantly impacted by additional conversion capacity through the expansion of existing facilities or the construction of new refineries or plants worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products and have declined in certain periods as was the case for much of 2020 and could again decline in the future previous declines have had and any future declines would again have a negative impact on our results of operations 

legal technological and political developments and evolving market sentiment regarding fuel efficiency and lowcarbon fuel standards may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our performance 

many state provincial and national governments across the world have imposed and may impose in the future increases in fuel economy standards lowcarbon fuel standards restrictions on vehicles using petroleumbased fuel and other policies or regulations such as tax incentives or subsidies aimed at steering the public towards less petroleumdependent modes of transportation which could reduce demand for our products for example in september 2020 the governor of california issued an executive order seeking to require that sales of all new passenger vehicles be zeroemission by 2035 and medium to heavy duty vehicles be zeroemission by 2045 where feasible the executive order also requires state agencies to build out sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure other governmental authorities such as the uk and quebec have also announced intentions to adopt similar restrictions with respect to the sale of new combustionengine vehicles a reduction in the demand for our products could also result from a shift by consumers to alternative fuel vehicles whether as a result of technological or scientific advances consumer or investor sentiment towards our products and their relationship to the environment or legislation or regulation mandating or encouraging the use of alternative energy sources it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form timing or extent of any such governmental consumer or investor actions however a reduction in the demand for our products as a result of any of the foregoing events could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

developments with respect to lowcarbon fuel policies and the market for alternative fuels may affect demand for our renewable fuels and could adversely affect our financial performance 

lowcarbon fuel policies blending credits and stricter fuel efficiency standards to help reach ghg emissions reduction targets help drive demand for our renewable fuels any changes to a failure to enforce or a discontinuation of any of these policies goals and initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our renewable fuels businesses similarly new or changing technologies may be developed consumers may shift to alternative fuels or alternative fuel vehicles such as electric or hybrid vehicles other than the renewable fuels we produce and there may be new entrants into the renewable fuels production industry that could meet demand for lowercarbon transportation fuels and modes of transportation in a more efficient or less costly manner than our technologies and products which could also have a material adverse effect on our renewable fuels businesses for instance several other refiners have made or announced interest in investments in renewable diesel projects should these projects develop we would face competition from them for feedstocks and customers while such developments are currently uncertain a reduction in the demand for our renewable fuels or increased competition for feedstocks could adversely affect our financial performance 

investor sentiment towards climate change fossil fuels and other esg matters could adversely affect our business cost of capital and the price of our stock and other securities 

there have been efforts in recent years which have intensified during the covid19 pandemic aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups to promote the divestment of securities of energy companies as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies as a result some financial intermediaries investors and other capital markets participants have reduced or ceased lending to or investing in companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure such as the energy industry for example in december 2020 the state 

of new york announced that it will be divesting the state’s common retirement fund from fossil fuels if this or similar divestment efforts are continued the price of our common stock or debt securities and our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain new investment or financing may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on esg practices and disclosures including practices and disclosures related to ghgs and climate change in the energy industry in particular and diversity and inclusion initiatives and governance standards among companies more generally as a result we may face increasing pressure regarding our esg practices and disclosures additionally members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for esg performance before investing in our common stock or debt securities or lending to us over the past few years there has also been an acceleration in investor demand for esg investing opportunities and many large institutional investors have committed to increasing the percentage of their portfolios that are allocated towards esgfocused investments as a result there has been a proliferation of esgfocused investment funds seeking esgoriented investment products 

if we are unable to meet the esg standards or investment or lending criteria set by these investors and funds we may lose investors investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us our cost of capital may increase the price of our common stock and debt securities may be negatively impacted and our reputation may also be negatively affected 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil rendered and recycled materials corn and other feedstocks could adversely affect our operations  

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional feedstock supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including from reduced sales volumes of products or reduced margins as a result of higher costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries for instance us sanctions with respect to iran and venezuela currently limit the ability of us companies to engage in oil transactions involving these countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

while darling our joint venture partner in dgd supplies some of dgd’s feedstock at competitive pricing dgd must still secure a significant amount of supply from other sources should darling’s supply be disrupted or should supply from other sources become limited or only available at unfavorable terms dgd could be required to develop alternate sources of supply while dgd does not believe feedstock supply is likely to be disrupted such an event could have an adverse impact on dgd’s and therefore our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our ethanol segment relies on corn sourced from local farmers and commercial elevators in the midcontinent region of the us as a result the feedstock supply of our ethanol segment is acutely exposed to the effects that weather and other environmental events occurring in that region as well as applicable governmental policies such as farming subsidies can have on crop production any reduction in crop production from these or similar events could reduce the supply of or otherwise increase our costs to obtain feedstocks for our ethanol segment 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and other feedstocks and the products that we manufacture 

we use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our refineries and plants and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels trucks or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailments collisions fires explosions governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for retail sites for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and they may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries or renewable diesel or ethanol plants could adversely affect our business 

our refineries renewable diesel plant and ethanol plants are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries or plants were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery or plant were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery or plant could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining renewable diesel or ethanol systems could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil rendered and recycled materials corn and many of our products 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our investments in joint ventures and other entities decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners we also conduct some of our operations through entities in which we have no ownership our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations for instance while we operate the dgd plant and perform certain daytoday operating and management functions for dgd as an independent contractor we do not have full control with respect to every aspect of dgd’s business and certain large actions concerning dgd including among others the acquisition or disposition of assets above a certain value threshold making certain changes to dgd’s business plan raising debt or equity capital dgd’s distribution policy and entering into particular transactions which currently require certain approvals from darling failure by us or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with joint ventures and any differences in views among us and our joint venture partners which could prevent or delay actions that are in the best interest of us or the joint venture could have a material adverse effect on our or our joint ventures’ financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

legal governmental and regulatory risks 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations and climate change litigation could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our refineries and plants as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future shortly after taking office in january 2021 president biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change president biden has also signed an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the previous administration and the current administration has issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the current administration has reviewed and approved the rule president biden’s executive orders as well as the us’s reentry into the paris agreement as discussed below may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations 

current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations discontinue use of certain process units or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example in 2015 the us canada and the uk participated in the united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement which was signed by the us in april 2016 requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 in november 2019 the previous administration served notice on the united nations that the us would withdraw from the paris agreement which ultimately occurred in 2020 however on january 20 2021 president biden signed an instrument that reverses this withdrawal and the us formally rejoined the paris agreement on february 19 2021 the us’s reentry into the paris agreement may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations additionally the paris agreement may affect our operations in canada the uk ireland and latin america restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various us states at the us federal level or in other countries could also adversely affect the oil and gas industry 

we could also face increased climate‐related litigation with respect to our operations or products governmental and other entities in various us states such as california and new york have filed lawsuits against coal gas oil and petroleum companies the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs seek damages and abatement under various tort theories similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions while we are currently not a party to any of these lawsuits they present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change which risk would also adversely impact the oil and gas industry 

compliance with the us environmental protection agency epa renewable fuel standard rfs could adversely affect our performance 

the us epa has implemented the rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the us a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the us as a producer of petroleumbased transportation fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels 

into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the us epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program the us epa missed its november 30 2020 statutory deadline to set the 2021 renewable volume obligations rvos establishing the volume of renewable fuels refiners must blend into their fuel mix in 2021 and to date has not issued a proposed rule for the 2021 rvo while there are statutory targets still in place the ultimate rvo for 2021 and the potential costs associated therewith remain uncertain until the rvo is set 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including us epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter the ultimate outcome of the 2021 rvo rule will also likely affect rin prices if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the us epa’s rfs mandates our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the current administration has also been critical of exemptions from the rfs mandates granted to small refineries during the previous administration while litigation over the issue is currently before the us supreme court the us epa under the current administration may be less willing to grant such waivers going forward and may increase the rvo obligations in future years to the extent fewer waivers are granted in the future or rvo obligations are increased the demand for and the price of rins would likely also increase and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

any attempt by the us government to withdraw from reenter materially modify any existing international trade agreements or enter into any new international trade agreements in the future could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the previous administration questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements for example the administration withdrew the us from the transpacific partnership in addition the previous administration implemented and proposed various trade tariffs which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on us goods 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment could adversely affect our business for example the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products 

while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms if the current us administration takes action to withdraw from reenter or materially modify any existing international trade agreements or to enter into any new international trade agreements in the future our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes vat payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in 

existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority although we believe we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in calculating our tax liabilities the final determination of these tax audits and any related proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty any adverse outcome of such tax audits or related proceedings could result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities that may individually or in the aggregate materially affect our cash tax liabilities results of operations and financial condition tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control it is also possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties with any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could impact our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date additionally our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws including tax treaties or their interpretations 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest rates 

on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop in the future we may need to renegotiate our financial agreements including but not limited to our 40 billion revolving credit facility or incur other indebtedness and we may be required to select and use a replacement reference rate for certain other outstanding debt the phaseout of libor or the use of any replacement reference rate may negatively impact the terms of and our ability to refinance such indebtedness and could also adversely affect the interest rate payable on and the liquidity and value of such indebtedness in addition the overall financial market and the ability to raise future indebtedness in a cost effective manner may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the uk’s economic and other relationships with the european union eu could adversely affect us 

in june 2016 the uk elected to withdraw from the eu in a national referendum brexit the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 consistent with the terms of the euuk withdrawal agreement with a transition period that ended on december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 the uk left the eu single market and customs union as well as all eu policies and international agreements as a result the free movement of persons goods services and capital between the uk and the eu ended and the eu and the uk formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces on december 24 2020 the european commission reached a trade agreement with the uk on the terms of its future cooperation with the eu the trade agreement offers uk and eu companies preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas subject to rules of origin requirements the ultimate impact of this trade agreement and the broader economic and regulatory consequences of brexit however are currently unknown and it is possible that such effects and consequences could ultimately adversely impact our operations and financial performance 

cyber security and privacy related risks 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in i a loss of intellectual property proprietary information or employee customer or vendor data ii public disclosure of sensitive information iii increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging thirdparty experts and consultants iv systems interruption v disruption of our business operations vi remediation costs for repairs of system damage vii reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence and viii damage to our competitiveness stock price and longterm stockholder value a breach could also originate from or compromise our customers’ and vendors’ or other thirdparty networks outside of our control a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders employees customers vendors and governmental authorities us and nonus there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability subject us to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business we collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international provincial and local levels in many areas of our business including data privacy and security laws such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

the gdpr applies to activities regarding personal data that may be conducted by us directly or indirectly through vendors and subcontractors from an establishment in the eu as interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations which could cause us to incur additional costs failure to comply could result in significant penalties of up to a maximum of 4 percent of our global turnover that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information requires that companies take certain actions including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us directly or indirectly from california residents as interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the gdpr and ccpa as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to our business pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result 

general risk factors 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs may increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

severe weather events such as storms hurricanes droughts or floods could have an adverse effect on our operations and could increase our costs for instance severe weather events can have an impact on crops production and reduce the supply of or otherwise increase our costs to obtain feedstocks for our ethanol and renewable diesel segments if climate changes result in more intense or frequent severe weather events the physical and disruptive effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations and assets 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

certain workers at five of our us refineries as well as at each of our canadian and uk refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements which generally have unique and independent expiration dates to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action at our facilities or at facilities owned or operated by third parties that support our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future federal state or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor their coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events

overview and outlook 

overview 

business operations update 

the outbreak of covid19 and its development into a pandemic in march 2020 has resulted in significant economic disruption globally including in north america europe and latin america the primary geographic areas where we operate in march governmental authorities around the world took actions such as stayathome orders and other social distancing measures to slow the spread of covid19 that restricted travel public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and inperson interaction across the globe these actions significantly reduced global economic activity and negatively impacted many businesses including our business airlines have dramatically reduced flights and motor vehicle usage has significantly declined in each case relative to typical prepandemic levels as a result in the first half of 2020 there was a decline in the demand for and thus also the market prices of most of the transportation fuels that we produce and sell there was also a decline in the global demand for crude oil the primary feedstock for our refined products resulting in a decline in crude oil prices and production levels while the production levels of all types of crude oils have declined sour crude oil production has declined significantly and by more than production levels for sweet crude oils this has reduced the price advantage of sour crude oils relative to sweet crude oils which has exacerbated the negative impact of lower product prices on our refining margin 67 

beginning in the latter part of the second quarter certain governmental authorities in the us and other countries across the world particularly those in our us gulf coast and us midcontinent regions began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of covid19 while governmental authorities in our us west coast and north atlantic regions began lifting restrictions on a more moderate basis during the third quarter this resulted in an increase in the level of individual movement and travel and in turn an increase in the demand and market prices for most of our products relative to what we experienced during the early months of the pandemic however in the second half of 2020 many locations where restrictions were lifted and others where the restrictions were only more moderately lifted such as california in our us west coast region and new york canada and the uk in our north atlantic region experienced a resurgence in the spread of covid19 which prompted many governmental authorities to reimpose certain restrictions in december 2020 the us fda and canadian and uk regulators each granted emergencyuse authorization for multiple covid19 vaccines to be used as immunization against the covid19 virus although these vaccines may be seen as a key factor in helping to restore public confidence and thus stimulate and increase economic activity potentially to prepandemic levels they may not be distributed widely on a timely basis and they may not be effective against new variants of the virus based on these and other circumstances that cannot be predicted the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and financial position remain uncertain 

as previously noted the decrease in the demand for transportation fuels has resulted in a significant decrease in the price of refined petroleum products manufactured by our refining segment for example the price of gasoline 8 in the us gulf coast region where eight of our 15 refineries are located was 6882 per barrel at the beginning of 2020 fell to 1765 per barrel at the end of march a 74 percent decline and partially recovered to 5763 per barrel by the end of december a 16 percent decline over 

6 see page 46 for our definition of refining margin and why we believe it is an important financial and operating measure 

7 sour crude oils typically sell at a discount to the price of benchmark sweet crude oils which set the price of most refined products therefore lower prices for sour crude oils that we process have a favorable impact on our refining margin 

8 gasoline prices quoted represent the price of us gulf coast conventional blendstock of oxygenate blending gasoline 

the twelvemonth period another example is the price of diesel 9 in the us gulf coast region which was 8171 per barrel at the beginning of 2020 fell to 3918 per barrel at the end of march a 52 percent decline and partially recovered to 6020 per barrel by the end of december a 26 percent decline over the twelvemonth period on february 22 2021 the prices of gasoline and diesel were 7662 per barrel and 7684 per barrel respectively 

demand for renewable diesel has not declined due to continued demand for this lowcarbon transportation fuel despite the current economic environment therefore our renewable diesel segment has not been impacted as were our refining and ethanol segments 

the price of ethanol manufactured by our ethanol segment has also decreased due to a decline in demand because ethanol is primarily blended into gasoline ethanol demand declined along with the decline in the demand for gasoline 

prices for the products we sell and the feedstocks we purchase impact our revenues cost of sales operating income and liquidity in addition a decline in the market prices of products and feedstocks below their carrying values in our inventory results in a writedown in the value of our inventories and a subsequent recovery in market prices results in a writeup in the value of our inventories not to exceed their previous carrying values these inventory valuation adjustments are referred to as lcm inventory valuation adjustments and are described in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements we wrote down the value of our inventories by 25 billion in the first quarter of 2020 due to the significant decline in market prices at that time but as market prices improved the writedown was fully reversed by the end of the third quarter 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we generated an operating loss of 16 billion our operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 including operating results by segment are described in the summary below and detailed descriptions can be found under “results of operations” on pages 37 through 49 

our cash and cash equivalents increased by 730 million during 2020 from 26 billion as of december 31 2019 to 33 billion as of december 31 2020 we invested 24 billion in our business and returned 18 billion to our stockholders primarily through dividend payments these uses of cash were offset by proceeds from two public debt offerings totaling 40 billion before deducting the underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs as described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition our operations generated net cash of 948 million which was driven by a decrease in inventory on hand we had 90 billion of liquidity 10 as of december 31 2020 a summary of our cash flows is presented on page 50 and a description of our cash flows and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources including measures we have taken to address the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our liquidity can be found under “liquidity and capital resources” on pages 49 through 55 

we have responded in multiple ways to the impacts from the covid19 pandemic on our business and we will strive to continue to respond to these impacts during the early months of the pandemic we reduced the amount of crude oil processed at most of our refineries in response to the decreased demand for our products we temporarily idled various gasolinemaking units at certain of our refineries to further limit gasoline production and we took measures to reduce jet fuel production we also temporarily idled 

9 diesel prices quoted represent the price of us gulf coast ultralow sulfur diesel 

10 see the components of our liquidity as of december 31 2020 in the table on page 50 under “liquidity and capital resources— our liquidity ” 

eight of our ethanol plants and reduced production at our other ethanol plants in each case in order to address the decreased demand for ethanol we have since increased the production of most of our products to align with increasing demand and we restarted the gasolinemaking units and most of the ethanol plants that had been temporarily idled demand for our products taken as a whole however has not returned to prepandemic levels and as of december 31 2020 our refineries and plants are operating to meet current product demand in addition to these measures and the issuances of an aggregate of 40 billion of debt previously noted we have addressed our liquidity as outlined below 

• we deferred projects representing approximately 500 million of capital investments that we had expected to make in 2020 related to our refining and ethanol segments 

• we deferred income and indirect eg vat and motor fuel taxes tax payments of approximately 440 million due in the first and second quarters of 2020 these deferrals were provided to taxpayers under new legislation such as the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act in the us and by various taxing authorities under existing legislation as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 250 million of deferred tax payments of the 250 million approximately 70 percent will be paid in 2021 and 30 percent in 2022 

• we have not purchased any shares of our common stock under our stock purchase program since midmarch 2020 and we will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate we have no obligation to make purchases under our stock purchase program 

• we entered into a 364day revolving credit facility on april 13 2020 with an aggregate principal amount of up to 875 million as described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 and february 22 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 

• we extended the maturity date of our accounts receivable sales facility to july 2021 and decreased the facility amount from 13 billion to 10 billion as described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2020 and february 22 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 

many uncertainties remain with respect to the covid19 pandemic including its resulting economic effects and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from the pandemic on our business and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic subsides the timing or effectiveness of vaccine distributions or whether any recovery will ultimately experience a reversal or other setbacks however the adverse impacts of the economic effects on our company have been and will likely continue to be significant we believe we have proactively addressed many of the known impacts of the pandemic to the extent possible and we will strive to continue to do so but there can be no assurance that these or other measures will be fully effective 

results for the year ended december   31 2020 

for 2020 we reported a net loss attributable to valero stockholders of 14 billion compared to net income attributable to valero stockholders of 24 billion for 2019 which represents a decrease of 38 billion the decrease was primarily due to lower operating income of 54 billion partially offset by a 16 billion decrease in income taxes the decrease in operating income included a 224 million charge for the impact of a liquidation of lifo inventory layers which is described in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements and in note a on page 44 

while our operating income decreased by 54 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 adjusted operating income decreased by 50 billion adjusted operating income excludes the lifo liquidation adjustment and other adjustments to operating income reflected in the table in note f on page 49 

the 50 billion decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to the following 

• refining segment refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by 51 billion primarily due to decreases in gasoline and distillate margins lower throughput volumes and the higher cost of biofuel credits partially offset by higher margins on other products and lower operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense this is more fully described on pages 41 and 42 

• renewable diesel segment renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income increased by 62 million primarily due to a favorable impact from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities this is more fully described on page 43 

• ethanol segment ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by 40 million primarily due to lower ethanol prices and production volumes partially offset by higher prices on corn related coproducts lower corn prices and lower operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense this is more fully described on pages 43 and 44 

outlook 

as previously discussed many uncertainties remain with respect to the covid19 pandemic and while it is difficult to predict the ultimate economic impacts that the pandemic will have on us and how quickly we can recover once the pandemic subsides we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2021 

• gasoline jet fuel and diesel prices are expected to improve as industrywide excess inventory levels continue to draw toward historical levels and product demand recovers 

• sour crude oil discounts are not expected to improve until opec production is increased in response to any growth in global oil demand 

• renewable diesel margins are expected to remain consistent with current levels 

• ethanol margins are expected to decline 

as a result of brexit in june 2016 the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 consistent with the terms of the euuk withdrawal agreement in late december 2020 the european commission reached a trade agreement with the uk on the terms of its future cooperation with the eu the trade agreement offers uk and eu companies preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas subject to rules of origin requirements although the ultimate impact of this trade agreement is currently unknown we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our operations in the uk 

in midfebruary 2021 the us gulf coast and us midcontinent regions experienced a severe winter storm that disrupted the operation of industrial facilities like refineries plants and logistical assets including ours located in those regions most facilities experienced curtailments or outages of various utilities and other services necessary for such facilities to remain operational all of our facilities in those 

regions were impacted to some extent by the severe cold andor supply and utility disruptions we are in the process of returning to normal operations and we are currently unable to estimate the impact this event will have on our results of operations

revenues decreased by 434 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment the decrease in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales of 379 billion and a decrease in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense of 112 million which resulted in a 54 billion decrease in operating income from 38 billion of operating income in 2019 to an operating loss of 16 billion in 2020 the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs partially offset by the 224 million lifo liquidation adjustment which is described in note a on page 44 

adjusted operating income decreased by 50 billion from 37 billion of adjusted operating income in 2019 to an adjusted operating loss of 13 billion in 2020 the 50 billion decrease includes a 112 million decrease in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization 

expense associated with our corporate activities and this decrease is discussed below the remaining components of the decrease in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analysis that follows 

general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 112 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in employee incentive compensation expenses of 37 million a decrease in charitable contributions of 20 million lower advertising expenses of 18 million and lower taxes other than income taxes of 16 million as well as the effect from transaction costs of 7 million associated with the merger transaction with vlp in 2019 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” increased by 109 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to interest expense associated with public debt offerings in 2020 and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020 see notes 6 and 10 in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 

income tax expense decreased by 16 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense our effective tax rate was 45 percent in 2020 compared to 20 percent in 2019 the effective tax rate for 2020 was impacted by a us federal tax net operating loss nol carried back to 2015 when the us federal statutory rate was 35 percent as described in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by 48 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower earnings associated with dgd the decrease in dgd’s earnings is primarily due to the effect of a 156 million benefit for the 2018 blender’s tax credit recognized in 2019 of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest as described in note b on page 44 

refining segment results 

the following table includes selected financial and operating data of our refining segment for 2020 and 2019 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables on pages 37 and 38 respectively unless otherwise noted 



refining segment operating income decreased by 54 billion in 2020 however refining segment adjusted operating income which excludes the adjustments in the table in note f on page 48 decreased 

by 51 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 the components of this decrease along with the reasons for the changes in those components are outlined below 

• refining segment margin decreased by 54 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 

refining segment margin is primarily affected by the prices of the refined petroleum products that we sell and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we process the table on page 39 reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe had a material impact on the change in our refining segment margin in 2020 compared to 2019 

the decrease in refining segment margin was primarily due to the following 

◦ a decrease in distillate primarily diesel margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately 34 billion 

◦ a decrease in gasoline margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately 17 billion 

◦ a decrease in throughput volumes of 397000 bpd had an unfavorable impact of 773 million as noted in “overview and outlook— overview —business operations update” on pages 33 through 35 as a result of the economic disruption from the covid19 pandemic we reduced the amount of crude oil processed at our refineries and limited the production of gasoline and jet fuel at certain of our refineries during the early months of the pandemic while we have since increased the production of most of our products and restarted the gasolinemaking units that we had temporarily idled at certain of our refineries in order to align with increasing demand for most of our products we expect to continue to operate most of our refineries at reduced rates 

◦ an increase in the cost of biofuel credits primarily rins in the us had an unfavorable impact of 330 million see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our government and regulatory compliance programs 

◦ higher margins on other products had a favorable impact of approximately 11 billion 

• refining segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 345 million primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity costs of 161 million lower chemical and catalyst costs of 78 million lower maintenance expenses of 40 million and lower employee incentive compensation costs of 28 million the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower production 

• refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased by 76 million primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of 118 million associated with capital projects that were completed and finance leases that commenced in the latter part of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020 partially offset by lower refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense of 33 million 

renewable diesel segment results 

the following table includes selected financial and operating data of our renewable diesel segment for 2020 and 2019 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables on pages 37 and 38 respectively unless otherwise noted 



renewable diesel segment operating income decreased by 94 million in 2020 however renewable diesel segment adjusted operating income which excludes the adjustment in the table in note f on page 48 increased by 62 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher renewable diesel segment margin 

renewable diesel segment margin increased by 66 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from commodity derivative instruments associated with our price risk management activities we recognized a hedge gain of 34 million in 2020 compared to a hedge loss of 24 million in 2019 resulting in a favorable change of 58 million between the years 

ethanol segment results 

the following table includes selected financial and operating data of our ethanol segment for 2020 and 2019 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables on pages 37 and 38 respectively unless otherwise noted 



ethanol segment operating income decreased by 72 million in 2020 however ethanol segment adjusted operating income which excludes the adjustments in the table in note f on page 48 decreased by 40 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the components of this decrease along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below 

• ethanol segment margin decreased by 137 million in 2020 compared to 2019 

ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by prices of the ethanol and corn related coproducts that we sell and the cost of corn that we process the table on page 40 reflects market reference prices that we believe had a material impact on the change in our ethanol segment margin in 2020 compared to 2019 

the decrease in ethanol segment margin was primarily due to the following 

◦ lower ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately 166 million 

◦ a decrease in production volumes of 681000 gallons per day had an unfavorable impact of approximately 92 million as noted in “overview and outlook— overview —business operations update” on pages 33 through 35 as a result of the economic disruption from the covid19 pandemic eight of our ethanol plants were temporarily idled and production was reduced at our remaining ethanol plants during the early months of the pandemic however demand for ethanol began to recover during the latter part of 2020 and as a result most of our ethanol plants have recently increased production to meet current product demand 

◦ higher prices on the coproducts that we produce primarily ddgs had a favorable impact of approximately 79 million 

◦ lower corn prices had a favorable impact of approximately 45 million 

• ethanol segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 98 million primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity costs of 43 million lower chemical and catalyst costs of 23 million and lower maintenance expenses of 15 million the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to lower production 

 

the following notes relate to references on pages 32 through 44 

a cost of materials and other for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a charge of 224 million related to the liquidation of lifo inventory layers attributable to our refining and ethanol segments our inventory levels decreased throughout 2020 due to lower production resulting from lower demand for our products caused by the negative economic impacts of covid19 on our business as a result our inventory levels at december 31 2020 were below their december 31 2019 levels of the 224 million charge recognized for the year ended december 31 2020 222 million and 2 million is attributable to our refining and ethanol segments respectively 

b cost of materials and other for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 includes a benefit related to the blender’s tax credit the legislation authorizing the credit through december 31 2022 was passed and signed into law in december 2019 as a result for the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a benefit of 297 million related to the blender’s tax credit attributable to renewable diesel volumes blended during 2020 the legislation also reinstated the credit retroactively to volumes blended during 2019 and 2018 and 

consequently we recognized a benefit of 449 million in december 2019 for the blender’s tax credit attributable to volumes blended during those two years the entire amount was recognized by us in december 2019 because the law was enacted in that month 

the abovementioned pretax benefits are attributable to our reportable segments and stockholders as follows 





c the market value of our inventories accounted for under the lifo method fell below their historical cost on an aggregate basis as of march 31 2020 as a result we recorded an lcm inventory valuation adjustment of 25 billion in march 2020 the market value of our lifo inventories improved due to the subsequent recovery in market prices which resulted in a full reversal of the reserve by september 30 2020 the lcm inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects a net benefit of 19 million due solely to the foreign currency translation effect of the portion of the lcm inventory valuation adjustments attributable to our international operations 

d depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2020 includes 30 million in accelerated depreciation related to a change in the estimated useful life of one of our ethanol plants 

e “other income net” for the year ended december 31 2019 includes a 22 million charge from the early redemption of 850 million of our 6125 percent senior notes due february 1 2020 

f we use certain financial measures as noted below that are not defined under us gaap and are considered to be nongaap financial measures 

we have defined these nongaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements including industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable us gaap measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable us gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap in addition these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently which diminishes their utility 

nongaap financial measures are as follows 

◦ refining margin is defined as refining operating income loss excluding the blender’s tax credit not attributable to volumes blended during the applicable period the lifo liquidation adjustment the lcm inventory valuation adjustment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



◦ renewable diesel margin is defined as renewable diesel operating income excluding the blender’s tax credit not attributable to volumes blended during the applicable period operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and depreciation and amortization expense as reflected in the table below 



◦ ethanol margin is defined as ethanol operating income loss excluding the lifo liquidation adjustment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



◦ adjusted refining operating income loss is defined as refining segment operating income loss excluding the blender’s tax credit not attributable to volumes blended during the applicable period the lifo liquidation adjustment the lcm inventory valuation adjustment and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



◦ adjusted renewable diesel operating income is defined as renewable diesel segment operating income excluding the blender’s tax credit not attributable to volumes blended during the applicable period as reflected in the table below 



◦ adjusted ethanol operating income loss is defined as ethanol segment operating income loss excluding the lifo liquidation adjustment the change in estimated useful life and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



◦ adjusted operating income loss is defined as total company operating income loss excluding the blender’s tax credit not attributable to volumes blended during the applicable period the lifo liquidation adjustment the lcm inventory valuation adjustment the change in estimated useful life and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below 



g we use throughput volumes sales volumes and production volumes for the refining segment renewable diesel segment and ethanol segment respectively due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

during the first half of 2020 our liquidity was negatively impacted by the significant economic effects resulting from the covid19 pandemic as described in “overview and outlook— overview— business operations update” however we took a number of actions to address the economic environment and its impact on our liquidity most notably two public debt offerings totaling 40 billion before deducting the underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs which are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements we took other actions to address our liquidity and those actions are described in “overview and outlook— overview— business operations update” on pages 33 through 35 and in the discussion of matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources below as a result of the actions taken during 2020 our liquidity position has improved as of december 31 2020 compared to the end of the first quarter of 2020 which was when the pandemic began to have a negative impact on our business 

our liquidity 

our liquidity consisted of the following as of december 31 2020 in millions 



 

a the amount for our canadian revolver is shown in us dollars as set forth in the summary of our credit facilities in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements the availability under our canadian revolver as of december 31 2020 in canadian dollars was c145 million 

b excludes 161 million of cash and cash equivalents related to our variable interest entities vies that is available for use only by our vies 

information about our outstanding borrowings letters of credit issued and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we believe that cash provided by operations along with cash from our public debt offerings in april and september of 2020 and available borrowings under our credit facilities is sufficient to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

cash flows 

components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we used 948 million of cash generated by our operations and 46 billion in borrowings to make 24 billion of investments in our business fund 25 billion of other financing activities and increase our available cash on hand by 730 million the borrowings are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

as previously noted our operations generated 948 million of cash in 2020 which was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change in working capital of 345 million the change in working capital was affected primarily by a 740 million use of cash 11 resulting from the rapid decline in market prices of refined petroleum products and crude oil as a result of the negative economic effects of the covid19 pandemic that impacted our receivables and accounts payable this use of cash along with other uses of cash were partially offset by a 10 billion source of cash driven by a reduction in inventory levels on hand details regarding the components of the change in working capital along with the reasons for the changes in those components are described in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition see “results of operations” for an analysis of our net loss 

our investing activities of 24 billion consisted of 25 billion in capital investments as defined below of which 548 million related to selffunded capital investments by dgd and 251 million was related to capital expenditures of vies other than dgd 

other financing activities of 25 billion consisted primarily of 16 billion in dividend payments 490 million of payments of debt and finance lease obligations 208 million to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests and 156 million for the purchase of common stock for treasury 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we used 55 billion of cash generated by our operations 21 billion in borrowings and 399 million of cash on hand to make 30 billion of investments in our business and fund 51 billion of other financing activities the borrowings are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

as previously noted our operations generated 55 billion of cash in 2019 driven primarily by net income of 28 billion noncash charges to income of 25 billion and a positive change in working capital of 294 million details regarding the components of the change in working capital along with the reasons for the changes in those components are described in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition see “results of operations” for an analysis of our net income 

our investing activities of 30 billion consisted primarily of 29 billion in capital investments as defined below of which 160 million is related to selffunded capital investments by dgd and 225 million was related to capital expenditures of vies other than dgd 

other financing activities of 51 billion consisted primarily of 18 billion of payments of debt and finance lease obligations 15 billion in dividend payments 950 million to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of vlp and 777 million for the purchase of common stock for treasury 

11 represents the net cash flow change in “receivables net” of 33 billion and accounts payable of 41 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 as described in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

capital investments 

our operations are highly capital intensive each of our refineries and plants comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil and other feedstock processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

our capital investments include capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures capital investments attributable to valero which is a nongaap financial measure reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows excluding the portion of dgd’s capital investments attributable to our joint venture partner and all of the capital expenditures of other vies 

we are a 5050 joint venture partner in dgd and consolidate dgd’s financial statements as a result all of dgd’s net cash provided by operating activities or operating cash flow is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities dgd’s partners use dgd’s operating cash flow excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves because dgd’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each partner only 50 percent of dgd’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments we also exclude the capital expenditures of our other consolidated vies because we do not operate those vies we believe capital investments attributable to valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments 

capital investments attributable to valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments its most comparable us gaap measure nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under us gaap in addition this nongaap measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently which may diminish its utility 



we expect to incur capital investments and capital investments attributable to valero in 2021 as follows by reportable segment in millions 



approximately 60 percent of the capital investments attributable to valero are for sustaining the business and 40 percent are for growth strategies almost half of which is allocated to expanding the renewable diesel business however we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant this capital investment estimate excludes strategic acquisitions if any 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase program 

on january 23 2018 our board of directors authorized the 2018 program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2020 we had 14 billion available for purchase under the 2018 program which has no expiration date we have not purchased any shares of our common stock under the 2018 program since midmarch 2020 and we will evaluate the timing of repurchases when appropriate we have no obligation to make purchases under this program 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute 128 million to our pension plans and 22 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2021 see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries or plants could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities 

tax matters 

under deferrals provided by recently passed legislation such as the cares act in the us and by various taxing authorities under other existing legislation we deferred approximately 440 million of income and indirect eg vat and motor fuel taxes tax payments due in the first and second quarters of 2020 as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 250 million of deferred tax payments of the 250 million approximately 70 percent will be paid in 2021 and 30 percent in 2022 

we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority when we take such positions we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions if any that should be recognized in our financial statements tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained 

as of december 31 2020 our liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest and penalties was 821 million of this amount 525 million is associated with refund claims associated with taxes paid on incentive payments received from the us federal government for blending biofuels into refined petroleum products we recorded a tax refund receivable of 525 million in connection with our refund claims but we also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 525 million due to the complexity of this matter and uncertainties with respect to sustaining these refund claims therefore our financial position results of operations and liquidity will not be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in sustaining these refund claims the remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest and penalties of 296 million represents our potential future obligations to various taxing authorities if the tax positions associated with that liability are not sustained 

details about our liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits are included in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2020 25 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our international subsidiaries cash held by our international subsidiaries can be repatriated to us without any us federal income tax consequences but certain other taxes may apply including but not limited to withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and us state income taxes therefore there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our international subsidiaries to us but we believe that such amount is not material to our financial position or liquidity 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions including the uncertainties concerning the covid19 pandemic and volatility in the global oil markets however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable see also item 1a “risk factors”—risks related to our business industry and operations— developments with respect to lowcarbon fuel policies and the market for alternative fuels may affect demand for our renewable fuels and could adversely affect our financial performance 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 are summarized below in millions 



 

a debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs finance lease obligations include related interest expense debt obligations due in 2021 include 598 million associated with borrowings under the ienova revolver as defined and described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the construction of terminals in mexico by central mexico terminals as defined and described 

in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements the ienova revolver is only available to the operations of central mexico terminals and its creditors do not have recourse against us 

b operating lease liabilities include related interest expense 

c other longterm liabilities exclude amounts related to the longterm portion of operating lease liabilities that are separately presented above 

debt and finance lease obligations 

our debt and finance lease obligations are described in notes 10 and 6 respectively of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase as of december 31 2020 all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt including debt guaranteed by us are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

debt obligations – interest payments 

interest payments for our debt obligations as described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements are the expected payments based on information available as of december 31 2020 

operating lease liabilities 

our operating lease liabilities arise from leasing arrangements for the right to use various classes of underlying assets as described in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements operating lease liabilities are recognized for leasing arrangements with terms greater than one year and are not reduced by minimum lease payments to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements industrial gas supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements natural gas supply arrangements and various throughput transportation and terminaling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and plants substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the 

preceding table include both short and longterm obligations and are based on i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and ii fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the preceding table we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2020 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective in 2020 and january 2021 the effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the abovereferenced note 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

unrecognized tax benefits 

we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority when we take such positions we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions if any that should be recognized in our financial statements tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained 

the evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations these judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the progress of ongoing tax audits case law and changes in legislation 

details of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits are included in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

longlived assets primarily property plant and equipment are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable a 

longlived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition if a longlived asset is not recoverable an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the longlived asset exceeds its fair value with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated such estimates include but are not limited to assumptions about future sales volumes commodity prices operating costs margins the use or disposition of the asset the asset’s estimated remaining useful life and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired we first evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill by taking into consideration relevant events and circumstances if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount no further testing is necessary however if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value 

during 2020 we performed qualitative assessments of the reporting unit to which our goodwill is related to determine if the quantitative impairment test was necessary we considered companyspecific information such as current and future financial performance as well as external factors that could affect the fair value of the reporting unit we evaluated i the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on the demand for our products and utilization of our us refineries ii the expected contribution from the reporting unit which historically has had strong performance and iii the estimated margin between the carrying amount and the implied enterprise value of our reporting unit due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for impairment changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings 

as of december 31 2020 we determined there was no impairment of our longlived assets or goodwill as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of feedstocks primarily crude oil and corn the products we produce primarily refined petroleum products and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including futures and options to manage the volatility of 

• inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels determined on a lifo basis differ from our previous yearend lifo inventory levels and 

• forecasted purchases andor product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount of gain or loss that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price for all of our commodity derivative instruments entered into for purposes other than trading with which we have market risk was not material see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2020 

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs to manage this risk we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs

valero’s operations 

effective january 1 2019 we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business accordingly we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production the renewable diesel segment includes the operations of dgd which were transferred from the refining segment on january 1 2019 also effective january 1 2019 we no longer have a vlp segment and we include the operations of vlp in our refining segment this change was made because of the merger transaction with vlp as defined and discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference and the resulting change in how we manage vlp’s operations we no longer manage vlp as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment 

as a result as of december 31 2019 we had three reportable segments as follows 

 

 

 

financial information about these segments is presented in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum products 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks historically refining margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of refined petroleum product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products and they could decline in the future which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations discontinue use of certain process units or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example in 2015 the us canada and the uk participated in the united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement which was signed by the us in april 2016 requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 in november 2019 the current us administration served notice on the united nations that the us would withdraw from the paris agreement in 2020 there are no guarantees that the paris agreement will not be reimplemented in the us or reimplemented in part by specific us states or local governments regardless the paris agreement could still affect our operations in canada the uk ireland and latin america restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various us states at the us federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry 

investor sentiment towards climate change fossil fuels and sustainability could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups to promote the divestment of shares of energy companies as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies if these efforts are successful our stock price and our ability to access capital markets may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices including practices related to ghgs and climate change in the energy industry as a result we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices additionally members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock 

if we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors we may lose investors our stock price may be negatively impacted and our reputation may be negatively affected 

severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

severe weather events such as storms droughts or floods could have an adverse effect on our operations members within the scientific community believe that an increasing concentration of ghg emissions in the earth’s atmosphere may contribute to climate changes that can have significant physical effects including an increased frequency and severity of these types of events 

compliance with the us environmental protection agency epa renewable fuel standard rfs could adversely affect our performance 

the us epa has implemented the rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol and diesel that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the us a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the us as a producer of petroleumbased transportation fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the us epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including us epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the us epa’s rfs mandates our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations  

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

any attempt by the us government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current us administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements for example the administration withdrew the us from the transpacific partnership in addition the administration has 

implemented and proposed various trade tariffs which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on us goods 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment could adversely affect our business for example the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products 

while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms if the current us administration takes action to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture 

we use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailment collision fire explosion governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture  

we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets we own and lease rail cars for our operations rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations as well as industry practices and customs new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are frequently enacted or proposed and could result in increased expenditures for compliance either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators for example in the past several years the department of transportation and various agencies within the department of transportation including the surface transportation board the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the federal railroad administration have issued orders and rules pursuant to the federal railroad safety act of 1970 the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995 the rail safety improvement act of 2008 fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 and other statutory authorities concerning such matters as enhanced tank car standards positive train control and other operational controls safety training programs and notification requirements the general trend has been toward greater regulation of rail transportation over recent years we do not believe these orders and rules will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity although further changes in law regulations or industry practices could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and following the separation of our retail business in 2013 we do not have a companyowned retail network 

many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs may increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business 

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in i a loss of intellectual property proprietary information or employee customer or vendor data ii public disclosure of sensitive information iii increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging thirdparty experts and consultants iv systems interruption v disruption of our business operations vi remediation costs for repairs of system damage vii reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence and viii damage to our competitiveness stock price and longterm stockholder value a breach could also originate from or compromise our customers’ and vendors’ or other thirdparty networks outside of our control a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders employees customers vendors and governmental authorities us and nonus there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability subject us to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business including data privacy and security laws such as the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

the gdpr applies to activities regarding personal data that may be conducted by us directly or indirectly through vendors and subcontractors from an establishment in the eu as interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations which could cause us to incur additional costs failure to comply could result in significant penalties of up to a maximum of 4 percent of our global turnover that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information requires that companies take certain actions including notifications for security 

incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us directly or indirectly from california residents as interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa evolves it creates a range of new compliance obligations with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and cash flows 

the gdpr and ccpa as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to our business pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future federal state or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

on december 22 2017 tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax reform was enacted among other things tax reform reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implemented a new system of taxation for nonus earnings including by imposing a onetime tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries tax reform also generally i repealed the manufacturing deduction we previously were able to claim ii resulted in a shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system of taxation resulting in a minimum tax on the income of international subsidiaries the gilti tax rather than a tax deferral on such earnings in certain circumstances iii limits our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our “adjusted taxable income” plus 100 percent of our business interest income for the year and iv permits us to offset only 80 percent rather than 100 percent of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017 we have evaluated the effects of tax reform including the onetime deemed repatriation tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the provisions of tax reform taken as a whole did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities results of operations or financial condition we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying tax reform but it is possible that the internal revenue service irs could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities results of operations and financial condition 

our investments in joint ventures and other entities decrease our ability to manage risk 

we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners and in some entities in which we have no ownership or control our joint venture partners may have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations failure by us or an entity in which we have a jointventure interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our or our joint ventures’ financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest rates 

on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness 

will develop in the future we may need to renegotiate our financial agreements including but not limited to our revolving credit facility the valero revolver or incur other indebtedness and the phaseout of libor may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the uk’s economic and other relationships with the eu could adversely affect us 

in june 2016 the uk elected to withdraw from the eu in a national referendum brexit the uk withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 consistent with the terms of the euuk withdrawal agreement the terms of that agreement provide for a transition period from january 31 2020 to december 31 2020 during which the trading relationship between the uk and the eu will remain the same while the uk and the eu try to negotiate an agreement regarding their future trading relationship the ultimate effects of brexit will depend on whether an agreement is reached or on the specific terms of any such agreement that is reached either of which outcomes could adversely impact the ability to trade freely between the uk and the eu at the end of the transition period and could negatively impact our competitive position supplier and customer relationships and financial performance

nongaap financial measures 

the discussions in “overview and outlook” and “results of operations” below include references to financial measures that are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these nongaap financial measures include adjusted operating income including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments and refining ethanol and renewable diesel segment margin we have included these nongaap financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years see the tables in note f beginning on page 39 for reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable us gaap financial measures also in note f we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the nongaap financial measures provides useful information 

overview and outlook 

overview 

for 2019  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders of 24 billion compared to 31 billion for 2018  which represents a decrease of 700 million  this decrease is the result of a 569 million decrease in net income and a 131 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to a 279 million pretax increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018 of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest as described in note a on page 38  the decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease of 736 million in operating income between the periods net of the resulting 177 million decrease in income tax expense 

while operating income decreased by 736 million in 2019 compared to 2018 adjusted operating income decreased by 10 billion adjusted operating income excludes adjustments reflected in the table in note f on page 42 

the 10 billion decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following

results of operations 

the following tables including the reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to their most directly comparable us gaap financial measures in note f beginning on page 39 highlight our results of operations our operating performance and market reference prices that directly impact our operations 

effective january 1 2019 we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business accordingly we created a new reportable segment — renewable diesel — because of the growing importance of renewable fuels in the market and the growth of our investments in renewable fuels production the renewable diesel segment includes the operations of dgd which were transferred from the refining segment on january 1 2019 also effective january 1 2019 we no longer have a vlp segment and we include the operations of vlp in our refining segment this change was made because of the merger transaction with vlp as described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements and the resulting change in how we manage vlp’s operations we no longer manage vlp as a business but as logistics assets that support the operations of our refining segment our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation

revenues decreased by 87 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment this decline in revenues was partially offset by lower cost of sales of 79 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and a decrease of 57 million in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense resulting in a decrease in operating income of 736 million in 2019 compared to 2018  

general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 57 million in 2019 compared to 2018  this decrease was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of 108 million associated with certain nonoperating sites in 2018 partially offset by increases in legal and other environmental reserves of 24 million and 12 million respectively as well as higher taxes other than income taxes of 8 million and expenses associated with the merger transaction with vlp of 7 million 

adjusted operating income was 37 billion in 2019 compared to 47 billion in 2018  details regarding the 10 billion decrease in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below 

“other income net” decreased by 26 million in 2019 compared to 2018  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest income of 30 million and higher foreign currency transaction losses of 14 million partially offset by the favorable effect of a 16 million lower charge for the early redemption of debt between the periods as described in note d on page 39  we redeemed debt in both 2019 and 2018 and incurred early redemption charges of 22 million and 38 million respectively 

income tax expense decreased by 177 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense our effective tax rate was 20 percent for 2019 compared to 21 percent for 2018  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 131 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a 279 million increase in blender’s tax credits recognized in 2019 compared to 2018  of which 50 percent is attributable to the holder of the noncontrolling interest as described in note a on page 38

we have defined these nongaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements including industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable us gaap measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable us gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap in addition these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently which diminishes their utility

the following table includes selected financial data for the total company corporate and other for 2018 and 2017 the selected financial data is derived from the financial highlights by segment and total company tables on pages 35 and 36  unless otherwise noted 



revenues increased by 231 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment this improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of 220 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and an increase of 96   million in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense resulting in an increase in operating income of 10   billion in 2018 compared to 2017  

general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased by 96 million in 2018 compared to 2017  this increase was primarily due to environmental reserve adjustments of 108 million associated with certain nonoperating sites in 2018  partially offset by expenses incurred in 2017 associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from plains all american pipeline lp of 16 million 

adjusted operating income was 47 billion in 2018 compared to 38 billion in 2017  details regarding the 919   million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below 

“other income net” increased by 18 million in 2018 compared to 2017  this increase was primarily due to higher equity in earnings associated with our diamond pipeline joint venture of 39   million and higher interest income of 29 million partially offset by a 38   million charge for the early redemption of debt as described in note   d on page 39  

income tax expense increased by 18 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the effect from a 19   billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from tax reform as described in note e on page 39 excluding the effect of tax reform from 2017  the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28   percent compared to 21   percent for 2018  the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the us statutory income tax rate from 35   percent to 21   percent effective january 1 2018 as a result of tax reform 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 140 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher earnings associated with dgd which includes a benefit for the blender’s tax credit

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

our liquidity consisted of the following as of december 31 2019 in millions 



 

 

information about our outstanding borrowings letters of credit issued and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash flows 

components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 

our operations generated 55 billion of cash in 2019  driven primarily by net income of 28 billion  noncash charges to income of 25 billion  and a positive change in working capital of 294 million  noncash charges included 23 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and 234 million of deferred income tax expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the change in our working capital is detailed in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements the source of cash resulting from the 294 million change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 55 billion of cash generated by our operations along with i 992 million of proceeds from debt issuances related to our 400 percent senior notes ii 239 million of proceeds from borrowings of vies and iii 399 million from available cash on hand were used mainly to 



 in addition during the year ended december 31 2019  we sold and repaid 900 million of eligible receivables under our accounts receivable sales facility 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2018 

our operations generated 44 billion of cash in 2018  driven primarily by net income of 34 billion and noncash charges to income of 23 billion  partially offset by a negative change in working capital of 13 billion  noncash charges included 21 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and 203 million of deferred income tax expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the change in our working capital is detailed in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements the use of cash resulting from the 13 billion change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 44 billion of cash generated by our operations along with i 13 billion of proceeds from debt issuances and borrowings ii 109 million of proceeds from borrowings of vies and iii 29 billion from available cash on hand were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 

our operations generated 55 billion of cash in 2017  net income of 42 billion net of the 19 billion noncash benefit from tax reform and other noncash charges of 21 billion and a positive change in working 

capital of 13 billion were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017  other noncash charges included 20 billion of depreciation and amortization expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the tax reform benefit and the change in our working capital are detailed in notes 15 and 18  respectively of notes to consolidated financial statements the source of cash resulting from the 13 billion change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 55 billion of cash generated by our operations along with borrowings of 380 million under the vlp revolver were used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

we consider capital investments to include the following 

 

we include dgd’s capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures in capital investments because we as operator of dgd manage its capital projects and expenditures we do not include the capital expenditures of our other consolidated vies in capital investments because we do not operate those vies in addition we do not include expenditures for acquisitions and acquisitions of undivided interests in capital investments 

we expect to make capital investments of approximately 25 billion in 2020  approximately 60 percent of those investments are for sustaining the business and 40 percent are for growth strategies however we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant this capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions including acquisitions of undivided interests 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase program 

on january 23 2018 our board of directors authorized the 2018 program for the purchase of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2019  we had 15 billion remaining available for purchase under the 2018 program with no expiration date we have no obligation to make purchases under this program 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 140 million to our pension plans and 21 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2020  see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities 

tax matters 

we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority when we take such positions we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions if any that should be recognized in our financial statements tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained 

as of december 31 2019  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest and penalties was 868 million of this amount 525 million is associated with refund claims associated with taxes paid 

on incentive payments received from the us federal government for blending biofuels into refined petroleum products we recorded a tax refund receivable of 525 million in connection with our refund claims but we also recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 525 million due to the complexity of this matter and uncertainties with respect to sustaining these refund claims therefore our financial position results of operations and liquidity will not be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in sustaining these refund claims the remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest and penalties of 343 million represents our potential future obligations to various taxing authorities if the tax positions associated with that liability are not sustained 

details about our liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits are included in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2019  15 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our international subsidiaries cash held by our international subsidiaries can be repatriated to us without any us federal income tax consequences as a result of the deemed repatriation provisions of tax reform but certain other taxes may apply including but not limited to withholding taxes imposed by certain international jurisdictions and us state income taxes therefore there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our international subsidiaries to us but we believe that such amount is not material to our financial position or liquidity 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 are summarized below in millions 



 

 

debt and finance lease obligations 

our debt and finance lease obligations are described in notes 9 and 5  respectively of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase as of december 31 2019  all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt including debt guaranteed by us are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

debt obligations – interest payments 

interest payments for our debt obligations as described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements are the expected payments based on information available as of december 31 2019  

operating lease liabilities 

our operating lease liabilities arise from leasing arrangements for the right to use various classes of underlying assets as described in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements operating lease liabilities are recognized for leasing arrangements with terms greater than one year and are not reduced by minimum lease payments to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements industrial gas supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements natural gas supply arrangements and various throughput transportation and terminaling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and ethanol plants substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short and longterm obligations and are based on i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and ii fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the preceding table we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2019  

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective january 1 2020 or will become effective in the future the effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the abovereferenced note 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

unrecognized tax benefits 

we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority when we take such positions we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions if any that should be recognized in our financial statements tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax 

benefits which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained 

the evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations these judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the progress of ongoing tax audits case law and changes in legislation 

details of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits are included in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies 

the amount of our accruals for environmental matters are included in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forwardlooking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2019 was 941 percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017 was 2344 percent 553 percent and 1931 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2020 in millions 



our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spotrate approach under this approach our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate if the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged our net periodic benefit cost would increase by 16 million for pension benefits and 2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2020  

see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

inventory valuation 

the cost of our inventories is principally determined under the lastin firstout lifo method using the dollarvalue lifo approach our lifo inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our nonlifo inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value the market value of our lifo inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories 

we compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis excluding materials and supplies in determining the market value of our inventories we assume that feedstocks are converted into refined products which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products we also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our plants to the appropriate points of sale we then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories if the aggregate market value is less than cost we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil refined petroleum products primarily gasoline and distillate renewable diesel grain primarily corn renewable diesel feedstocks and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including futures and options to manage the volatility of 

 

 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs to manage this risk we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable some of these contracts are derivative instruments however we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would have resulted from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts was not material see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments dollars in millions the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented

we sell our gasoline and distillate products as well as other products such as asphalt lube oils and natural gas liquids ngls on a wholesale basis through an extensive rack marketing network the principal purchasers of our refined petroleum products from terminal truck racks are wholesalers distributors retailers and truckdelivered end users throughout the us canada the uk ireland and latin america through our operations in peru and mexico 

the majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels the remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the valerobrand family that operate 5335 branded sites in the us 907 branded sites in the uk and ireland and 792 branded sites in canada as of december 31 2018  these sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multiyear contracts for branded sites products are sold under the valero ®  beacon ®  diamond shamrock ®  and shamrock ®  brands in the us the texaco ®  brand in the uk and ireland and the ultramar ®  brand in canada 

bulk sales 

we also sell our gasoline and distillate products as well as other products such as asphalt petrochemicals and ngls through bulk sales channels in the us and international markets our bulk sales are made to various oil companies traders and bulk endusers such as railroads airlines and utilities our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline barges and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs 

we also enter into refined petroleum product exchange and purchase agreements these agreements help minimize transportation costs optimize refinery utilization balance refined petroleum product availability broaden geographic distribution and provide access to markets not connected to our refined product pipeline systems exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined petroleum products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and thirdparties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined petroleum products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined petroleum products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations 

logistics 

we own logistics assets crude oil pipelines refined petroleum product pipelines terminals tanks marine docks truck rack bays and other assets that support our refining operations and these assets are not owned by vlp see discussion of the vlp segment on page 10  

ethanol 

we own 14 ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of 173 billion  gallons per year our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities a that process corn to produce ethanol distillers grains and corn oil b  we source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators our facilities receive corn primarily by rail and truck we publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to facilitate corn supply transactions 

we sell our ethanol primarily to refiners and gasoline blenders under term and spot contracts in bulk markets such as new york chicago the us gulf coast florida and the us west coast we also export our ethanol into the global markets we ship our dry distillers grains ddgs by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the us and mexico we also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites and corn oil by truck and rail we distribute our ethanol through logistics assets which include railcars owned by us 

the following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants their approximate annual production capacities for ethanol in millions of gallons and ddgs in tons and their approximate annual corn processing capacities in millions of bushels 



the combined production of ethanol from our plants averaged 41 million gallons per day for 2018  

 



vlp 

vlp is a limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal systems in the us gulf coast and us midcontinent regions that provide transportation and terminaling services to our refining segment and are integral to the operations of our ardmore corpus christi east and west houston mckee memphis meraux port arthur st charles and three rivers refineries

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum   products 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks historically refining margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of refined petroleum product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products and they could decline in the future which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management 

pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations discontinue use of certain process units or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example the international maritime organization imo will be implementing a new regulation for a global sulphur cap for marine bunker fuels by the year 2020 imo 2020 under the imo 2020 cap vessels will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur content of no more than 050 percent beginning in january 2020 versus the current sulphur limit of 350 percent while there are many uncertainties imo 2020 could affect our business by creating the continued need for new and updated process units necessary to produce the low sulphur marine fuel and could increase the costs of our products 

in addition in 2015 the us canada and the uk participated in the united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement which was signed by the us in april 2016 requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 while the current us administration announced its intent to withdraw from the paris agreement in june 2017 under the agreement’s terms the earliest the us can withdraw is 2020 there are no guarantees that the agreement will not be reimplemented in the us or reimplemented in part by specific us states or local governments however the paris agreement could still affect our operations in canada the uk ireland and latin america restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various us states at the us federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry 

severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the earth’s atmosphere among other reasons may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such climatic events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

compliance with the us environmental protection agency renewable fuel standard could adversely affect our performance 

the us environmental protection agency epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into 

transportation fuels consumed in the us a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the us as a producer of petroleumbased transportation fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the us epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including us epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the us epa’s rfs mandates our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations  

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

any attempt by the us government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current us administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements for example the administration has withdrawn the us from the transpacific partnership and has indicated that the administration may withdraw the us from the north american free trade agreement nafta in order to encourage the us congress to vote on ratification of the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca which was signed in november 2018 and is intended to be the successor to nafta in addition the administration has implemented and proposed various trade tariffs which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on us goods   

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment could adversely affect our business for example the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products 

while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms if the current us administration takes action to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture 

we use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailment collision fire explosion governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture  

we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets we own and lease rail cars for our operations rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are frequently enacted or proposed and could result in increased expenditures for compliance either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators for example in the past several years the department of transportation the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the federal railroad administration have issued orders and rules pursuant to the rail safety improvement act of 2008 fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 and other statutory authorities concerning such matters as enhanced tank car standards operational controls safety training programs and notification requirements while some recent actions have provided some regulatory relief the general trend has been toward greater regulation we do not believe these orders and rules will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity although further changes in law regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and following the separation of our retail business in 2013 we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may 

be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business 

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in i a loss of intellectual property proprietary information or employee customer or vendor data ii public disclosure of sensitive information iii increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies training employees and engaging thirdparty experts and consultants iv systems interruption v disruption of our business operations vi remediation costs for repairs of system damage vii reputational damage that 

adversely affects customer or investor confidence and viii damage to our competitiveness stock price and longterm stockholder value a breach could also originate from or compromise our customers’ and vendors’ or other thirdparty networks outside of our control a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders employees customers vendors and governmental authorities us and nonus there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

in addition new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including the european union general data protection regulation and recent california legislation pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future federal state or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

on december 22 2017 tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax reform was enacted among other things tax reform reduces the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implements a new system of taxation for nonus earnings including by imposing a onetime tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries tax reform also generally will i limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our “adjusted taxable income” plus 100 percent of our business interest income for the year and ii permit us to offset only 80 percent rather than 100 percent of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017 we have evaluated the effects of tax reform including the onetime deemed repatriation tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the provisions of tax reform taken as a whole did not have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities results of operations or financial condition we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying tax reform but it is possible that the internal revenue service irs could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities results of operations and financial condition 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest rates 

on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority fca in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop in the future we may need to renegotiate our revolving credit facility the valero revolver or incur other indebtedness and the phaseout of libor may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the uk’s economic and other relationships with the european union could adversely affect us 

in june 2016 the uk elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum brexit withdrawal negotiations have yet to produce an overall structure for an ongoing relationship between the uk and the european union following brexit the ongoing uncertainty and potential imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade as a result of brexit could negatively impact our competitive position supplier and customer relationships and financial performance the ultimate effects of brexit will depend on the specific terms of any agreement reached by the uk and the european union

 item 7 management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with item 1a “risk factors” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” included in this report 

cautionary statement for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “overview and outlook” includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 you can identify our forwardlooking statements by the words “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “scheduled” “estimate” “project” “projection” “predict” “budget” “forecast” “goal” “guidance” “target” “could” “would” “should” “will” “may” and similar expressions 

these forwardlooking statements include among other things statements regarding 

 

we based our forwardlooking statements on our current expectations estimates and projections about ourselves and our industry we caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict in addition we based many of these forwardlooking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forwardlooking statements differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forwardlooking statements could result from a variety of factors including the following 



 

any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forwardlooking statements ultimately prove to be accurate our forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forwardlooking statements we do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so 

all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forwardlooking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

this report includes references to financial measures that are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these nongaap financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders adjusted operating income including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments and refining and ethanol segment margin we have included these nongaap financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years see the accompanying financial tables in “results of operations” and note h to the accompanying tables for reconciliations of 

these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures also in note h we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the nongaap financial measures provides useful information 

overview and outlook 

overview 

for 2018  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders of 31 billion  compared to 41 billion  for 2017  which represents a decrease of 943 million  this decrease is primarily due to a 19 billion tax benefit in 2017  resulting from tax reform which is discussed in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements partially offset by a 10 billion increase in income before income tax expense the increase in income before income tax expense is primarily due to higher operating income between the years as described below 

operating income was 46 billion  for 2018  compared to 36 billion  for 2017  which represents an increase of 10 billion  excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 32  adjusted operating income increased by 931 million in 2018 compared to 2017 

the 931 million increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

additional details and analysis for the changes in operating income and adjusted operating income for our reportable business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders including a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures used in this overview to their most comparable measures reported under us gaap are provided below under “results of operations” 

outlook 

below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2019 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

the following tables highlight our results of operations our operating performance and market reference prices that directly impact our operations in addition these tables include financial measures that are not defined under us gaap and represent nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are reconciled to their most comparable us gaap financial measures and include adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders adjusted operating income and refining and ethanol segment margin in note h to these tables we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of nongaap financial measures provides useful information 

on january 10 2019 we completed our acquisition of all the outstanding publicly held common units of vlp pursuant to the merger agreement with vlp as defined and discussed in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements upon completion of the merger transaction vlp became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of valero

revenues increased 231 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated with sales made by our refining segment this improvement in revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of 22 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and an increase of 96 million in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense resulting in an increase in operating income of 10 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  

excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 32  adjusted operating income increased by 931 million in 2018 compared to 2017 details regarding the 931 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below 

other income net increased 18 million in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher equity in earnings associated with our diamond pipeline joint venture of 39 million and higher interest income of 29 million partially offset by a 38 million charge from the early redemption of debt as described in note c to the accompanying tables see page 45  

income tax expense increased 18 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the effect from a 19 billion  income tax benefit in 2017  resulting from tax reform which is described in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 31  from both years the effective tax rate for 2018  was 22 percent compared to 28 percent for 2017  the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the us statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 as a result of tax reform 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 140 million in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to higher earnings associated with dgd our consolidated joint venture which includes a benefit of 80 million for the blender’s tax credit as described in note a to the accompanying tables see page 45  

refining segment results 

refining segment revenues increased 230 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices this improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of 218 billion due primarily to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs resulting in an increase in refining segment operating income of 11 billion  in 2018 compared to 2017 

excluding the adjustments to refining segment operating income reflected in the tables on page 32  refining segment adjusted operating income increased by 961 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  the components of this increase along with reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below 

refining segment margin as defined in note h to the accompanying tables see page 46  increased 12 billion  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the following 



 

 

 

 

refining segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 140 million  primarily due to higher employeerelated expenses of 33 million an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices  323 per mmbtu in 2018  compared to 298 per mmbtu in 2017  of 28 million higher chemicals and catalyst costs of 24 million the effect from a favorable insurance settlement of 20 million in 2017 for our mckee refinery and higher maintenance expense of 12 million 

refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 63 million  due to an increase in refinery turnaround amortization expense of 41 million primarily due to costs incurred in the latter part of 2017  and early 2018  in connection with significant turnaround projects at our corpus christi and mckee refineries along with the writeoff of assets that were idled or demolished in 2018 of 15 million 

ethanol segment results 

ethanol segment revenues increased 138 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an increase in ethanol sales volumes and increases in corn related coproduct prices along with the revenue contribution associated with three ethanol plants acquired from green plains inc green plains on november 15 2018 which is described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements this increase is partially offset by lower ethanol prices this improvement in ethanol segment revenue was more than offset by higher cost of sales of 228 million primarily due to higher corn prices resulting in a decrease in ethanol segment 

operating income of 90 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  the components of this decrease along with reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below 

ethanol segment margin as defined in note h to the accompanying tables see page 46  decreased 66 million in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

ethanol segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 27 million  primarily due to costs to operate the three plants acquired from green plains in november 2018 of 14 million coupled with higher chemicals and catalysts expenses of 8 million 

vlp segment results 

vlp segment revenues increased 94 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to 75 million of incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with the port arthur terminal and the parkway pipeline acquired by vlp in november 2017 that were formerly a part of the refining segment the increase in vlp segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of 44 million primarily due to the costs to operate the acquired terminal and pipeline resulting in an increase in vlp segment operating income of 53 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 32  vlp adjusted operating income increased 50 million 

corporate and eliminations 

corporate and eliminations which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense increased by 98 million in 2018  compared to 2017  excluding the environmental reserve adjustments of 108 million from 2018 reflected in the table on page 32  adjusted corporate and eliminations decreased by 10 million in 2018 primarily due to the effect from expenses incurred in 2017  associated with the termination of the acquisition of certain assets from plains

in june 2016 we recognized an asset impairment loss of 56 million representing all of the remaining carrying value of the longlived assets of our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in aruba collectively the aruba terminal we recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the goa as a result of agreements entered into in june 2016 between the goa and citgo for the goa’s lease of those assets to citgo 

in september   2016 and in connection with the aruba disposition our us subsidiaries cancelled all outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our aruba subsidiaries which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit of 42 million during the year ended december 31 2016 

 

we have defined these nongaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements including industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable us gaap measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable us gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap in addition these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently which diminishes the utility of these measures 

nongaap measures are as follows 







 

 

 

refining segment margin per barrel of throughput and adjusted refining segment operating income per barrel of throughput represents refining segment margin and adjusted refining segment operating income each as defined in note h above divided by the respective throughput volumes ethanol segment margin per gallon of production and adjusted ethanol segment operating income per gallon of production represent ethanol segment margin and 

adjusted ethanol segment operating income each as defined in note h above divided by production volumes pipeline transportation revenue per barrel of throughput and terminaling revenue per barrel of throughput represent pipeline transportation revenue and terminaling revenue for our vlp segment divided by pipeline transportation throughput and terminaling throughput volumes respectively throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying production throughput and production volumes per day as provided in the accompanying tables by the number of days in the applicable period 

total company corporate and other 

revenues increased 183 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum products prices associated with sales made by our refining segment this improvement in revenues was mostly offset by higher cost of sales of 182 billion primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs and an increase of 120 million in general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense resulting in an increase in operating income of 29 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

excluding the adjustments to operating income reflected in the tables on page 41  adjusted operating income increased by 781 million in 2017 compared to 2016 details regarding the 781   million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below 

income tax expense decreased 17 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the effect from a 19   billion income tax benefit in 2017 resulting from tax reform which is described in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 41  from both years the effective tax rate for 2017 was 28   percent compared to 26   percent for 2016 the effective tax rates are lower than the us statutory rate of 35   percent that was in effect through december   31 2017 primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the us the effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2017 due to a benefit in 2016 of 35   million resulting from the favorable resolution of an income tax audit 

refining segment results 

refining segment revenues increased 187 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices this improvement in refining segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of 184 million primarily due to increases in crude oil and other feedstock costs resulting in an increase in operating income of 245   million in 2017 compared to 2016 

excluding the adjustments to refining segment operating income reflected in the tables on page 41  refining segment   adjusted operating income increased by 944   million in 2017 compared to 2016 the components of this increase along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below 

refining segment margin as defined in note h to the accompanying tables see page 46  increased 12 billion primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refining segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 219 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices 298 per mmbtu for 2017 compared to 246 per mmbtu for 2016 

refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 66 million due to an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense primarily due to 

costs incurred in the latter part of 2016 in connection with significant turnaround projects at our port arthur and texas city refineries 

ethanol segment results 

ethanol segment revenues decreased 401 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower ethanol and corn related coproduct prices this decline in ethanol segment revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales of 233 million primarily due to lower corn prices resulting in a decrease in ethanol segment operating income of 168 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 41  ethanol segment adjusted operating income was 172 million  for 2017 compared to 290 million  for 2016 a decrease of 118 million the components of this decrease along with the reasons for the changes in these components are outlined below 

ethanol segment margin as defined in note h to the accompanying tables see page 46  decreased 75 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

ethanol segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 28 million primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices 298 per mmbtu for 2017 compared to 246 per mmbtu for 2016 

ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 15 million primarily due to the writeoff of assets that were idled in 2017 

vlp segment results 

vlp segment revenues increased 89 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to 61 million of incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services associated with the port arthur terminal and the parkway pipeline acquired by vlp in 2017 and the mckee meraux and three rivers 

terminals acquired by vlp in 2016 that were formerly a part of the refining segment in addition incremental revenues of 10 million were generated from an undivided interest in the red river crude system acquired in january 2017 the increase in vlp segment revenues was partially offset by higher cost of sales of 15 million primarily due to the costs to operate the acquired terminals pipeline and crude system resulting in an increase in vlp segment operating income of 71 million in 2017 compared to 2016 excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 41  vlp adjusted operating income increased 74 million 

corporate and eliminations 

corporate and eliminations which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense increased 119 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher employee related costs of 50 million an increase in legal and environmental reserves of 21 million expenses associated with the termination of certain assets from plains of 16 million and an increase in charitable contributions of 10 million 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

our liquidity consisted of the following as of december 31 2018  in millions 



 

 

information about our outstanding borrowings letters of credit issued and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash flows summary 

components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 2018 

our operations generated 44 billion  of cash in 2018  driven primarily by net income of 34 billion  and noncash charges to income of 23 billion  partially offset by a negative change in working capital of 13 billion    noncash charges included   21 billion   of depreciation and amortization expense and 203 million  of deferred income tax expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the change in our working capital is detailed in note 18  of notes to consolidated financial statements the use of cash resulting from the 13 billion  change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 44 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with i 13 billion  in proceeds from debt issuances and borrowings and 109 million  in proceeds from borrowings of certain vies as discussed in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements and ii 29 billion  from available cash on hand were used mainly to 



 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 

our operations generated 55 billion  of cash in 2017  net income of 42 billion  net of the 19 billion  noncash benefit from tax reform and other noncash charges of 21 billion and a positive change in working capital of 13 billion  were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017 other noncash charges included 20 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense   see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the tax reform benefit and the change in our working capital are detailed in notes 15  and 18  respectively of notes to consolidated financial statements the source of cash resulting from the 13 billion  change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 55 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with borrowings of 380 million  under the vlp revolver as discussed in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 

our operations generated 48 billion  of cash in 2016  driven primarily by net income of 24 billion  net noncash charges to income of 14 billion  and a positive change in working capital of 976 million noncash charges included 19 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense 56 million for the asset impairment loss associated with our aruba terminal and 230 million  of deferred income tax expense partially offset by a benefit of 747 million  from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the change in our working capital is detailed in note 18  of notes to consolidated financial statements the source of cash resulting from the 976 million  change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 48 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with 22 billion in proceeds from debt issuances and borrowings as discussed in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

we define capital investments as capital expenditures for purchases of additions to and improvements in our property plant and equipment turnaround and catalyst costs and investments in joint ventures capital expenditures include the capital expenditures of our consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated vies in which we hold an ownership interest 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

for both 2019  and 2020  we expect to incur approximately 25 billion  for capital investments consisting of approximately 60 percent for sustaining capital and 40 percent for growth strategies however we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant this capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions including acquisitions of undivided interests 

in addition to our capital investments noted above we separately reflect in our statements of cash flows the capital expenditures of certain vies that we consolidate even though we do not hold an ownership interest in them these expenditures are not included in our 25 billion  estimate of capital investments for 2019  or 2020  see note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our vies 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

merger with vlp 

on january 10 2019 we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding publicly held common units of vlp pursuant to the merger transaction with vlp upon completion of the merger transaction each outstanding publicly held common unit was converted into the right to receive 4225 per common unit in cash without any interest thereon and all such publicly traded common units were automatically canceled and ceased to exist upon completion of the merger transaction we paid aggregate merger consideration of   950 million  which was funded with available cash on hand see note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the merger transaction 

stock purchase programs 

on january 23 2018 our board of directors authorized the 2018 program which authorized our purchase of up to an additional 25 billion  of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date this authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a 25 billion  program authorized under the 2016 program during the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our purchases under the 2016 program as of december 31 2018  we had 22 billion  remaining available for purchase under the 2018 program we have no obligation to make purchases under this program 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 35 million  to our pension plans and 21 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2019  see note 13  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see notes 8  and 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

the irs has ongoing audits related to our us federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2015 we have received revenue agent reports in connection with the 2010 and 2011 combined audit we have made significant progress in resolving this audit which we believe will be settled within the next 12 months upon settlement we anticipate receiving a refund therefore we have a receivable of 336 million associated with this audit as of december 31 2018  we do not expect to have a significant change to our uncertain tax positions upon the settlement of our ongoing audits and we believe that the ultimate settlement of our audits will not be material to our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

in conjunction with our implementation of the provisions under tax reform as described in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements we recorded a liability of 740 million  for the estimated us federal tax due on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries not previously distributed to us and we will pay this liability over the eightyear period permitted by the provisions under tax reform because of the deemed repatriation of these accumulated earnings and profits there are no longer any us federal income tax consequences associated with the repatriation of any of the 24 billion  of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries as of december 31 2018  however certain countries in which our international subsidiaries are organized impose withholding taxes on cash distributed outside of those countries we have accrued for withholding taxes on the portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have deemed not to be permanently reinvested in our operations in that country the remaining cash held by that subsidiary as well as our other international subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested in our operations in those countries 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  are summarized below in millions 



 

 

debt and capital lease obligations 

our debt and capital lease obligations are described in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt as of december 31 2018  are at or above investment grade level as follows 



in january 2019 after the completion of the merger transaction as described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements each of the rating agencies upgraded its rating of vlp’s senior unsecured debt to our rating the rating change follows the full and unconditional guarantee by us of vlp’s senior notes 

we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our longterm operating lease commitments include leases for land and office facilities time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels railcars facilities and equipment related to industrial gases and power used in our operations machinery and equipment used in our refining and ethanol operations and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstock refined petroleum product and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations under certain crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements industrial gas supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements natural gas supply arrangements and various throughput transportation and terminaling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of feedstock and utilities and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries and ethanol plants substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short and longterm obligations and are based on i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and ii fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the preceding table we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2018  

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective january 1 2019 or will become effective in the future the effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the abovereferenced note 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies 

the amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of december 31 2018  and 2017  are included in note 8  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

unrecognized tax benefits 

we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that may not be ultimately allowed by the relevant taxing authority when we take such positions we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions if any that should be recognized in our financial statements tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability in our balance sheets and 

that liability represents our potential future obligation to the taxing authorities if the tax position is not sustained 

the evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations these judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the progress of ongoing tax audits case law and changes in legislation 

our unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2018 and 2017 along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits are included in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 13  of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forwardlooking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2018  was 938   percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was 553 percent 1931 percent and 777 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements the following sensitivity analysis shows the effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2019  in millions 



our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spotrate approach under this approach our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate if the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged our net periodic benefit cost would increase by 10 million for pension benefits and 1 million for other postretirement benefits in 2019  

see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

inventory valuation 

the cost of our inventories is principally determined under the lastin firstout lifo method using the dollarvalue lifo approach our lifo inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our nonlifo inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value the market value of our lifo inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories 

we compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis excluding materials and supplies in determining the market value of our inventories we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined petroleum products which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined petroleum products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined petroleum products we also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale we then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories if the aggregate market value is less than cost we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income 

the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended december 31 2016 is discussed in note 5  of notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum   products 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks historically refining margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of refined petroleum product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products and they could decline in the future which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management 

pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations discontinue use of certain process units or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example the us environmental protection agency epa recently adopted the residual risk and technology review rule rtr adding new standards for air toxic emissions among other requirements emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities which may result in increased capital expenditures governmental regulations regarding ghg emissions and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business and an increase in the cost of and reduction in demand for the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

in addition in 2015 the us canada and the uk participated in the united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement which was signed by the us in april 2016 requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 while the current us administration announced its intent to withdraw from the paris agreement in june 2017 there are no guarantees that it will not be implemented in the us or in part by us states or local governments restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various us states or at the us federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry 

severe weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

some members within the scientific community believe that the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the earth’s atmosphere among other reasons may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such climatic events were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 

compliance with the us environmental protection agency renewable fuel standard could adversely affect our performance 

the us epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the us a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the us as a producer of petroleumbased transportation fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the us epa’s quota and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including us epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase and levels of transportation fuels produced which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the us epa’s rfs mandates our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations  

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

any attempt by the us government to withdraw from or materially modify existing international trade agreements could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the current us administration has questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement and has withdrawn the us from others such as the transpacific partnership the current us administration has also raised the possibility of greater restrictions on trade generally and significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the us 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment could adversely affect our business for example the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products 

while there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood timing and details of any such policies and reforms if the current us administration takes action to withdraw from or materially modify existing 

international trade agreements our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture 

we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailment collision fire explosion governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture  

we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets we own and lease rail cars for our operations rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are frequently enacted or proposed and could result in increased expenditures for compliance either directly through costs for our owned and leased rail assets or as passed along to us by rail carriers and operators for example in may 2014 the us department of transportation dot issued an emergency order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil in addition in november 2014 the federal railroad administration fra issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews in may 2015 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa in coordination with the fra issued new final rules for enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains in august 2016 phmsa adopted a final rule expanding the requirements and mandating additional controls for enhanced tank cars as required by the fixing america’s surface transportation fast act of 2015 while some recent actions—including 1 a december 2017 statement that phmsa intends to initiate rulemaking to rescind portions of its may 2015 rule and 2 an april 2017 final rule from fra that delays certain trainingprogram requirements—have provided some regulatory relief the general trend has been toward greater regulation we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity although further changes in law regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and following the separation of our retail business in 2013 we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business 

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products and could increase instability in 

the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in a loss of intellectual property proprietary information or employee customer or vendor data public disclosure of sensitive information increased costs to prevent respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events systems interruption or the disruption of our business operations a breach could also originate from or compromise our customers’ and vendors’ or other thirdparty networks outside of our control a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders employees customers and vendors there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

on december 22 2017 tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax reform was enacted among other things tax reform reduces the us corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018 and implements a new system of taxation for nonus earnings including by imposing a onetime tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries beginning in 2018 tax reform also generally will i limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30 percent of our “adjusted taxable income” plus 100 percent of our business interest income for the year and ii permit us to offset only 80 percent rather than 100 percent of our taxable income with any net operating losses we generate after 2017 while we are currently evaluating the effects of tax reform including the onetime deemed repatriation tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities we do not expect that the provisions of tax reform taken as a whole will have any adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities results of operations or financial condition in the absence of guidance on various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of tax reform we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying tax reform but it is possible that the internal revenue service irs could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities results of operations and financial condition 

we may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership vlp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to vlp liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity

this report includes references to financial measures that are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these nongaap financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders adjusted operating income loss and refining and ethanol segment margin we have included these nongaap financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods see the accompanying financial tables in “results of operations” and note d to the 

accompanying tables for reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures also in note d we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the nongaap financial measures provides useful information 

overview and outlook 

overview 

for 2017  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders of 41 billion  compared to 23 billion  for 2016 which represents an increase of 18 billion  this increase is primarily due to a 19 billion  income tax benefit in 2017  resulting from the implementation of the provisions under tax reform which was enacted on december 22 2017 see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about tax reform and the 19 billion benefit recorded by us excluding the impact of tax reform adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders in 2017  was 22 billion  this compares to adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders of 17 billion  in 2016 which has been adjusted for the amounts reflected in the table on page 34  the 479 million increase in adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders was primarily due to a 779 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years net of the resulting increase in income tax expense 

operating income was 36 billion  in each of 2017  and 2016 excluding the amounts reflected in the tables on page 34  from both years adjusted operating income was 37 billion  in 2017  compared to 29 billion  in 2016 which represents an increase of 779 million 

the 779 million increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

additional details and analysis for the changes in operating income and adjusted operating income for our reportable business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders including a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures used in this overview to their most comparable measures reported under us gaap are provided below under “results of operations” 

outlook 

below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2018 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

the following tables highlight our results of operations our operating performance and market reference prices that directly impact our operations in addition these tables include financial measures that are not defined under us gaap and represent nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are reconciled to their most comparable us gaap financial measures and include adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders adjusted operating income and refining and ethanol segment margin in note d to these tables we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of nongaap financial measures provides useful information 

effective january 1 2017 we revised our reportable segments to align with certain changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages and allocates resources to our business accordingly we created a new reportable segment — vlp the results of the vlp segment which include the results of our majorityowned master limited partnership referred to by the same name were transferred from the refining segment our prior period segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation the narrative following these tables provides an analysis of our results of operations

total company corporate and other 

operating revenues increased 183 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices associated with our refining segment this improvement in operating revenues was mostly offset by higher cost of materials and other and increases in other components of cost of sales between the years resulting in an increase in operating income of 27 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

excluding the adjustments to operating income in both years reflected in the tables on page 34  adjusted operating income was 37 billion  in 2017  compared to 29 billion  in 2016  details regarding the 779 million increase in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below 

corporate and eliminations which consists primarily of general and administrative expenses and related depreciation and amortization expense increased by 119 million in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher employee related costs of 50 million an increase in legal and environmental reserves of 21 million expenses associated with the termination of an acquisition transaction of 16 million and an increase in charitable contributions of 10 million 

income tax expense decreased 17 billion  from 2016  to 2017  primarily due to a 19 billion  income tax benefit in 2017  resulting from tax reform which is more fully described in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding this benefit the effective tax rate for 2017  was 28 percent this compares to an effective tax rate of 26 percent in 2016  which has been adjusted for the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 34  the effective tax rates are lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent that was in effect through december 31 2017 primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the us the effective tax rate in 2016  was lower than the 2017  rate due to a benefit of 35 million resulting from the favorable resolution of an income tax audit 

refining segment results 

refining segment operating revenues increased 187 billion  and cost of materials and other increased 175 billion  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to increases in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs respectively the resulting 12 billion increase in refining segment margin as defined in note d on page 48  was partially offset by increases in other components of cost of sales between the years resulting in an increase in operating income of 243 million from 38 billion  in 2016  to 40 billion  in 2017  

excluding the adjustments reflected in the tables on page 34  from operating income in both years adjusted operating income was 41 billion  in 2017  compared to 31 billion  in 2016  an increase of 942 million  the components of this increase are outlined below along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years 

refining segment margin increased 12 billion in 2017  compared to 2016  as previously noted primarily due to the following 



 

 

 

 

 

 

refining segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 221 million  primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices  298 per mmbtu in the 2017  compared to 246 per mmbtu in 2016  

refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 66 million  due to an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense primarily due to 

costs incurred in the latter part of 2016  in connection with significant turnaround projects at our port arthur and texas city refineries 

ethanol segment results 

ethanol segment operating revenues decreased 401 million  and cost of materials and other decreased 326 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to decreases in ethanol and corn related coproduct prices and lower corn prices respectively the resulting 75 million decrease in ethanol segment margin as defined in note d on page 48  along with increases in other components of cost of sales between the years resulted in a decrease in operating income of 168 million  from 340 million  in 2016  to 172 million  in 2017  

excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 34  from 2016  operating income adjusted operating income in 2016  was 290 million  compared to this adjusted amount operating income in 2017  decreased 118 million the components of this decrease are outlined below along with changes in these components between the years 

ethanol segment margin decreased 75 million in 2017  compared to 2016  as previously noted primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

ethanol segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 28 million  primarily due to an increase in energy costs driven by higher natural gas prices  298 per mmbtu in 2017  compared to 246 per mmbtu in 2016  

ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 15 million  primarily due to the writeoff of assets that were idled in 2017  

vlp segment results 

vlp segment operating revenues increased 89 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services provided to our refining segment associated with terminals and pipelines acquired in 2016  and 2017  this increase in vlp segment revenues was partially offset by increases in components of cost of sales between the years resulting in an increase in operating income of 71 million  from 221 million  in 2016  to 292 million  in 2017  

excluding the adjustment reflected in the table on page 34  from 2017  operating income adjusted operating income in 2017  was 295 million  an increase of 74 million compared to 2016  the components of this increase are outlined below along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years 

vlp segment revenues increased 89 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  as previously noted primarily due to the following 

 

 

vlp segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 8 million and 7 million respectively primarily due to expenses associated with the port arthur terminal the parkway pipeline and the red river crude system which were acquired in 2017

in june 2016 we recognized an asset impairment loss of 56 million  representing all of the remaining carrying value of the longlived assets of our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in aruba collectively the aruba terminal we recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the goa as a result of agreements entered into in june 2016 between the goa and citgo for the goa’s lease of those assets to citgo 

in september 2016 and in connection with the aruba disposition our us subsidiaries cancelled all outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our aruba subsidiaries which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit of 42 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  

 

we have defined these nongaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements including industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable us gaap measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable us gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under us gaap in addition these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently which diminishes the utility of these measures 

nongaap measures are as follows 

 





 



us gaap we are required to recognize the effect of tax reform in the period of enactment as a result we recognized a 19 billion  income tax benefit in december 2017 which represents the estimated impact of tax reform this estimate may be refined in future periods as further information becomes available

total company corporate and other 

operating revenues decreased 121 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum products prices associated with our refining segment this decline in operating revenues was partially offset by lower cost of materials and other and the positive effect from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in both years resulting in a decrease in operating income of 28 billion from 64 billion in 2015 to 36 billion in 2016 

excluding the adjustments to operating income in both years reflected in the tables on page 44  adjusted operating income was 29 billion  in 2016 compared to 71 billion  in 2015 details regarding the 43 billion decrease in adjusted operating income between the years are discussed by segment below 

income tax expense decreased 11 billion from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to lower income before income tax expense excluding the income tax adjustments reflected in the table on page 44  from both years the effective tax rate for 2016 was 26 percent compared to 30 percent in 2015 the effective tax rates are lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent primarily because income from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the us the effective tax rate in 2016 was lower than the 2015 rate due to a benefit of 35 million resulting from the favorable resolution of an income tax audit 

refining segment results 

refining segment operating revenues decreased 126 billion and cost of materials and other decreased 81 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to decreases in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs respectively the resulting 44 billion decrease in refining segment margin was partially offset by the positive effect from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in both years resulting in a decrease in operating income of 31 billion from 69 billion  in 2015 to 38 billion  in 2016 

excluding the adjustments reflected in the tables on page 44  from operating income in both years  adjusted operating income was 31 billion  in 2016 compared to 76 billion  in 2015 a decrease of 45 billion the components of this decrease are outlined below along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years 

refining segment margin decreased 44 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 as previously noted primarily due to the following 

 



decrease of 599 per barrel we estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in 2016 compared to 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining segment margin of approximately 16 billion 

 

 

 

 

refining segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 35 million primarily due to an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense resulting from the completion of turnaround projects at several of our refineries in 2016 

ethanol segment results 

ethanol segment operating revenues increased 467 million and cost of materials and other increased 386 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in ethanol production and sales volumes the resulting 81 million increase in ethanol segment margin along with the positive effect from the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in both years resulted in an increase in operating income of 198 million from 142 million  in 2015 to 340 million  in 2016 

excluding the adjustments reflected in the tables on page 44  from both years adjusted operating income was 290 million in 2016 compared to 192 million in 2015 an increase of 98 million the components of this increase are outlined below along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years 

ethanol segment margin increased 81 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as previously noted primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

ethanol segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense decreased 33 million primarily due to a 14 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices 246 per mmbtu in 2016 compared to 258 per mmbtu in 2015 and a 15 million decrease in chemical costs 

ethanol segment depreciation and amortization expense associated with our cost of sales increased 16 million primarily due to a 10 million gain on the sale of certain plant assets in 2015 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 

vlp segment results 

vlp segment operating revenues increased 119 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to incremental revenues generated from transportation and terminaling services provided to our refining segment associated with terminals acquired in 2015 and 2016 this increase in vlp segment revenues along with a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense between the years resulted in an increase in operating income of 129 million from 92 million in 2015 to 221 million in 2016 the components of this increase are outlined below along with the reasons for the changes in these components between the years 

vlp revenues increased 119 million in 2016 compared to 2015 as previously noted primarily due to the following 



rivers terminals which were acquired by vlp in 2016 and the st charles houston and corpus christi terminals which were acquired by vlp in 2015 

 

vlp segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense decreased 10 million primarily due to lower maintenance expense at the corpus christi terminal related to inspection activity in 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 

our operations generated 55 billion  of cash in 2017  net income of 42 billion net of the 19 billion  noncash benefit from tax reform and other noncash charges of 21 billion and a positive change in working capital of 13 billion  were the primary drivers of the cash generated by our operations in 2017 other noncash charges included 20 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense   see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the tax reform benefit and the change in our working capital are further detailed in notes 14  and 17  respectively of notes to consolidated financial statements the source of cash resulting from the 13 billion  change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 55 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with borrowings of 380 million  under a 750 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the vlp revolver as discussed in note 8  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 

our operations generated 48 billion  of cash in 2016  driven primarily by net income of 24 billion  net noncash charges to income of 14 billion  and positive change in working capital of 976 million noncash charges included 19 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense 56 million for the asset impairment loss associated with our aruba terminal and 230 million of deferred income tax expense partially offset by a benefit of 747 million  from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the change in our working capital is further 

detailed in note 17  of notes to consolidated financial statements the source of cash resulting from the 976 million change in working capital was mainly due to 

 

the 48 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with 22 billion  in proceeds from the issuance of debt including 125 billion  of 34 percent senior notes due september 15 2026  500 million  of 4375 percent senior notes due december 15 2026 issued by vlp and borrowings under the vlp revolver of 349 million  as discussed in note 8  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2015 

our operations generated 56 billion  of cash in 2015  driven primarily by net income of 41 billion  and noncash charges to income of 28 billion  noncash charges included 18 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense 790 million  from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and 165 million  of deferred income tax expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations however the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of 13 billion  as shown in note 17  of notes to consolidated financial statements this use of cash mainly resulted from 

 

the 56 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with i 145 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and ii net proceeds of 189 million  from vlp’s public offering of 4250000 common units as discussed in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

we define capital investments as capital expenditures for purchases of additions to and improvements in our property plant and equipment and turnaround and catalyst costs and investments in joint ventures 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

for 2018  we expect to incur approximately 27 billion for capital investments but we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant this capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions including acquisitions of undivided interests 

we consolidate the financial statements of vies if we are the primary beneficiary of their operations even though we may have no ownership interest in them because we consolidate the financial statements of these entities our financial statements reflect the capital expenditures they make our statements of cash flows separately reflect the capital expenditures made by these entities along with an equal offset of these amounts included in contributions from noncontrolling interests within financing activities and these expenditures are not included in our 27 billion estimate of 2018 capital investments see note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our vies 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  are summarized below in millions 



 

 

debt and capital lease obligations 

our debt and capital lease obligations are described in note 8  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined petroleum products and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum 

or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminaling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the preceding table include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the preceding table we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2017  

summary of credit facilities 

information about our outstanding borrowings letters of credit issued and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in note 8  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

on september 21 2016 our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional 25 billion  of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date this authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under the 2015 program during the first quarter of 2017 we completed our purchases under the 2015 program as of december 31 2017  we had 12 billion  remaining available for purchase under the 2016 program we have no obligation to make purchases under this program 

on january 23 2018 our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional 25 billion  of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 131 million  to our pension plans including discretionary contributions of 100 million  and 19 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2018  

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see notes   7  and 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

the irs has ongoing audits related to our us federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2015 and we have received revenue agent reports rars in connection with the 2010 and 2011 audit we are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the rars and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the irs we believe that the ultimate settlement of these audits will not be material to our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

in conjunction with our implementation of the provisions under tax reform which was enacted on december 22 2017 and is more fully described in note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements we recorded a liability in 2017 for the estimated us federal tax due on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings and profits of our international subsidiaries not previously distributed to us and we will pay this liability over the eightyear period permitted by the provisions under tax reform because of the deemed repatriation of these accumulated earnings and profits there are no longer any us federal income tax consequences associated with the repatriation of any of the 32 billion  of cash and temporary cash investments held by our international subsidiaries as of december 31 2017  however certain countries in which our international subsidiaries are organized impose withholding taxes on cash distributed outside of those countries we have accrued for withholding taxes on a portion of the cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we have deemed to not be permanently reinvested in our operations in that country 

cash provided by operating activities in the us continues to be our primary source of funds to finance our us operations and capital expenditures as well as our dividends and share repurchases 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements became effective january 1 2018 or will become effective in the future the effect on our financial statements upon adoption of these pronouncements is discussed in the abovereferenced note 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

inventory valuation 

the cost of our inventories is principally determined under the lastin firstout lifo method using the dollarvalue lifo approach our lifo inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value and our nonlifo inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value the market value of our lifo inventories is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories 

we compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis excluding materials and supplies in determining the market value of our inventories we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined products which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products we also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale we then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories if the aggregate market value is less than cost we recognize a loss for the difference in our statements of income 

the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 are discussed in note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies 

the amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of december 31 2017  and 2016  are included in note 7  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forwardlooking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2017  was 629   percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 1931 percent 777 percent and 146 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2018  in millions 



beginning in 2016 our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spotrate approach under this approach our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate if the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged our net periodic benefit cost would increase by 12 million for pension benefits and 2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2018  

see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax matters 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to an indirect tax exciseduty salesuse gross receipts andor valueadded tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different determinations of the amount of tax due 

including penalties and interest in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised 

in addition because of the significant and complex changes to the code from tax reform including the need for regulatory guidance from the irs to properly account for many of the changes we recorded income taxes for items where reasonable estimates could be made and we applied the code on a pretax reform basis for items where reasonable estimates could not be made as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no 118 “income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act” issued by the sec as a result we will record the effect in 2018 for items where we were unable to make a reasonable estimate in 2017 and we may revise estimates that were recorded in 2017 these amounts could be material see note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities and the impact from tax reform on those liabilities 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil refined petroleum products primarily gasoline and distillate grain primarily corn soybean oil and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including swaps futures and options to manage the volatility of 

 

 

we use the futures markets for the available liquidity which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk in millions 



see note 19  of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2017  

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and ghg emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs to manage these risks we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable some of these contracts are derivative instruments however we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values as of december 31 2017  there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts see note 19  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments dollars in millions the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented

benicia refinery  our benicia refinery is located northeast of san francisco on the carquinez straits of san francisco bay it processes sour crude oils into gasoline diesel jet fuel and asphalt gasoline production is primarily carbob gasoline which meets carb specifications when blended with ethanol the refinery receives crude oil feedstocks via a marine dock and crude oil pipelines connected to a southern california crude oil delivery system most of the refinery’s products are distributed via pipeline and truck rack into northern california markets 

wilmington refinery  our wilmington refinery is located near los angeles california the refinery processes a blend of heavy and highsulfur crude oils the refinery produces carbob gasoline diesel carb diesel jet fuel and asphalt the refinery is connected by pipeline to marine terminals and associated dock facilities that can move and store crude oil and other feedstocks refined petroleum products are distributed via pipeline systems to various thirdparty terminals in southern california nevada and arizona 

feedstock supply 

approximately 55 percent of our crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market our term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at marketrelated prices directly or indirectly from various national oil companies as well as international and us oil companies the contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts or terminate them effective as of the next scheduled renewal date by giving 

the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time  eg  60 days 6 months before expiration of the current term the majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer’s official stated price  ie  the “market” price established by the seller for all purchasers and not at a negotiated price specific to us 

marketing 

overview 

we sell refined petroleum products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets these sales include refined petroleum products that are manufactured in our refining operations as well as refined petroleum products purchased or received on exchange from third parties most of our refineries have access to marine transportation facilities and interconnect with commoncarrier pipeline systems allowing us to sell products in the us canada the uk and other countries 

wholesale rack sales 

we sell branded and unbranded gasoline and distillate production as well as other products such as asphalt lube oils and natural gas liquids ngls on a wholesale basis through an extensive rack marketing network the principal purchasers of our refined petroleum products from terminal truck racks are wholesalers distributors retailers and truckdelivered end users throughout the us canada the uk and ireland 

the majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels the remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the valerobrand family that operate approximately 5700 branded sites in the us approximately 900 branded sites in the uk and ireland and approximately 800 branded sites in canada these sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multiyear contracts for branded sites products are sold under the valero ®  beacon ®  diamond shamrock ®  and shamrock ®  brands in the us the texaco ®  brand in the uk and ireland and the ultramar ®  brand in canada 

bulk sales 

we sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production as well as other products such as asphalt petrochemicals and ngls through bulk sales channels in the us and international markets our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain bulk endusers such as railroads airlines and utilities our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline barges and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs 

we also enter into refined petroleum product exchange and purchase agreements these agreements help minimize transportation costs optimize refinery utilization balance refined petroleum product availability broaden geographic distribution and provide access to markets not connected to our refinedproduct pipeline systems exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined petroleum products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and thirdparties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined petroleum products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined petroleum products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations 

logistics 

we own logistics assets crude oil pipelines refined petroleum product pipelines terminals tanks marine docks truck rack bays and other assets that support our refining operations in addition through subsidiaries we own the 20 percent general partner interest and the majority of the limited partner interest in vlp vlp’s common units representing limited partner interests are traded on the nyse under the symbol “vlp” its assets support the operations of our ardmore corpus christi houston mckee memphis meraux port arthur st charles and three rivers refineries vlp is discussed more fully in note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

ethanol 

we own 11 ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of about 14 billion gallons per year our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities 1 that process corn to produce ethanol distillers grains and corn oil 2 we source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators our facilities receive corn primarily by rail and truck we publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to use to facilitate corn supply transactions 

we sell our ethanol primarily to refiners and gasoline blenders under term and spot contracts in bulk markets such as new york chicago the us gulf coast florida and the us west coast we ship our dry distillers grains ddgs by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the us and mexico we also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites and corn oil by truck or rail we distribute our ethanol through logistics assets which include railcars owned by us 

the following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants their approximate annual production capacities for ethanol in millions of gallons and ddgs in tons and their approximate corn processing capacities in millions of bushels 



the combined production of denatured ethanol from our plants averaged 38 million gallons per day during the year ended december 31 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined petroleum   products 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks historically refining margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined petroleum products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined petroleum products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of refined petroleum product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined petroleum products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined petroleum products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products and they could decline in the future which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management 

pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations discontinue use of certain process units  eg  hf alkylation or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example the us environmental protection agency epa has in recent years adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities which may result in increased capital expenditures governmental regulations regarding ghg emissions and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business and an increase in the cost of and reduction in demand for the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

in addition in 2015 the us canada and the uk participated in the united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement which was signed by the us in april 2016 requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 while the current administration is considering withdrawal from the paris agreement there are no guarantees that it will not be implemented restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various us states or at the us federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry 

finally some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg emissions in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

compliance with the us environmental protection agency renewable fuel standard could adversely affect our performance 

the us epa has implemented a renewable fuel standard rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels such as ethanol that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the united states a renewable identification number rin is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the us as a producer of petroleumbased transportation fuels we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the us epa’s quota 

and to the extent we do not we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program 

we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins we cannot predict the future prices of rins rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors including us epa regulations the availability of rins for purchase the price at which rins can be purchased and levels of transportation fuels produced all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins or if we are otherwise unable to meet the us epa’s rfs mandates our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations  

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined petroleum products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture 

we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailment collision fire explosion governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture  

we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets we own and lease rail cars for our operations rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance for example in may 2014 the us department of transportation dot issued an order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil in addition in november 2014 the us dot issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews in may 2015 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa and the federal railroad administration fra issued new final rules for enhanced 

tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains in august 2016 phmsa and fra adopted a final rule expanding the requirements and mandating additional controls for enhanced tank cars although we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity further changes in law regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and following the separation of our retail business we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service and fitch ratings on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities 

from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business 

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined petroleum products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in a loss of sensitive business information systems interruption or the disruption of our business operations there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad 

exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership vlp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to vlp liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

if our spinoff of cst the “spinoff” or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes then we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability 

we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares qualified as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff qualified for favorable treatment the irs did not rule however on whether the spinoff satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code instead the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling in connection with the private letter ruling we also obtained an 

opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code the opinion relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail furthermore notwithstanding the private letter ruling the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete or that the spinoff or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spinoff 

if the spinoff ultimately were determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spinoff generally would be treated as receiving a spinoff of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder any such spinoff would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013 and any accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such holder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain in addition we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spinoff date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock moreover we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff were taxable 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spinoff we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spinoff andor certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment however if the spinoff andor such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries cst would be responsible for all such taxes if we were to become liable for taxes under the tax matters agreement that liability could have a material adverse effect on us

we based our forwardlooking statements on our current expectations estimates and projections about ourselves and our industry we caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict in addition we based many of these forwardlooking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forwardlooking statements differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forwardlooking statements could result from a variety of factors including the following 



 

any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forwardlooking statements ultimately prove to be accurate our forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forwardlooking statements we do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so

this report includes references to financial measures that are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap these nongaap financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders gross margin and adjusted operating income we have included these nongaap financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods see the accompanying financial tables in “results of operations” for a reconciliation of these nongaap 

financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures in note d to the accompanying tables we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the nongaap financial measures provides useful information 

overview and outlook 

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2016  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 23 billion  and adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 17 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 40 billion  and adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 46 billion  the decrease in net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 17 billion  and the decrease in adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 29 billion  are outlined in the following table in millions 



the decrease in both net income and adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations was due to lower operating income in 2016  compared to 2015  net of the resulting decrease of 11 billion  in income tax expense between the years operating income decreased by 28 billion  while adjusted operating income decreased by 43 billion  as outlined by segment in the following table in millions 



 



the 28 billion  decrease in operating income was impacted by the net effect of noncash adjustments for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and an asset impairment loss we have excluded such effects from adjusted operating income because we believe that these adjustments are not indicative of our core operating performance and may obscure the underlying business results and trends the resulting 43 billion  decrease in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the following 

 

additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income and adjusted operating income of our business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations including a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures used in this overview to their most comparable measures reported under us gaap are provided below under “results of operations” beginning on page 27  

outlook 

for the year ended december 31 2016  margins were unfavorable compared to 2015 and thus far in the first quarter of 2017 margins have been mixed below are several factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2017

general 

operating revenues decreased  121 billion  or 14 percent and “cost of sales excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment” decreased 79 billion  or 11 percent for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to a decrease in refined petroleum products prices and crude oil feedstock costs respectively operating income decreased 28 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2016  compared to the year  ended december 31 2015  primarily due to a decrease in refining segment operating income of 30 billion  partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment operating income of 198 million  adjusted operating income decreased 43 billion  for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to a decrease in refining segment adjusted operating income of 44 billion  partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment adjusted operating income of 98 million  the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment adjusted operating income decreased 44 billion  for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to a 43 billion  decrease in refining gross margin 

refining gross margin decreased 43 billion  a 443 per barrel decrease for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the following 

 

 



 

 

ethanol 

ethanol segment adjusted operating income increased 98 million  for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to an 81 million  or 006 per gallon increase in gross margin and a 33 million  decrease in operating expenses 

the increase in ethanol segment gross margin of 81 million  was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

the 33 million  decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a 14 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices  246 per mmbtu in 2016  compared to 258 per mmbtu in 2015  and a 15 million decrease in chemical costs 

the increase of 16 million  in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a 10 million gain on the sale of certain plant assets in 2015 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense in that period 

other 

income tax expense decreased 11 billion  from 2015  to 2016  primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense the effective tax rates of 24 percent in 2016  and 31 percent in 2015  are lower than the us statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the us the 2016  rate was lower than the 2015  rate due to i the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve of 747 million  the majority of which impacted our international operations that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates ii a benefit of 42 million  associated with the transfer of ownership of the aruba refinery and aruba terminal to the goa and iii a benefit of 35 million resulting from the settlement of an income tax audit the transfer of ownership of the aruba refinery and the aruba terminal to the goa is more fully described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements

the following notes relate to references on pages 27  through 36  and pages 40  through 49  

 

 

in june 2016 we recognized an asset impairment loss of 56 million  representing all of the remaining carrying value of the longlived assets of our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal and transshipment facility in aruba collectively the aruba terminal we recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the goa as a result of agreements entered into in june 2016 between the goa and citgo for the goa’s lease of those assets to citgo 

in september 2016 and in connection with the aruba disposition our us subsidiaries cancelled all outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our aruba subsidiaries which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit in the us during the year ended december 31 2016  we had no income tax effect in aruba from the cancellation of debt or other effects of the aruba disposition because of net operating loss carryforwards associated with our operations in aruba against which we had previously recorded a full valuation allowance there was no other significant effect to our results of operations or cash flows from the aruba disposition during the year ended december 31 2016  

 

 

we have defined these nongaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements including industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because when reconciled to their most comparable us gaap measures they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends these nongaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable us gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of 

operations as reported under us gaap in addition these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently which diminishes the utility of these measures 

nongaap measures are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general 

operating revenues decreased 430 billion or 33 percent and “cost of sales excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment” decreased 443 billion or 37 percent for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in refined petroleum product prices and crude oil feedstock costs respectively despite the decrease in operating revenues “cost of sales excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment” decreased to a greater extent resulting in an increase in operating income of 456 million in 2015 with refining segment operating income increasing by 11 billion and ethanol segment operating income decreasing by 644 million adjusted operating income increased 15 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in refining segment adjusted operating income of 21 billion  partially offset by a decrease in ethanol segment adjusted operating income of 590 million  the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment adjusted operating income increased 21 billion  for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 21 billion  increase in refining gross margin and a 105 million  decrease in operating expenses partially offset by a 148 million  increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

refining gross margin increased 21 billion  a 192 per barrel increase for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the following 

 

 



in 2015 compared to 2014 for example we processed lls crude oil a type of light sweet crude oil in our us gulf coast region that sold at a discount of 126 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2015 compared to 277 per barrel in 2014 representing an unfavorable decrease of 151 per barrel another example is maya crude oil a type of sour crude oil that sold at a discount of 954 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2015 compared to a discount of 1373 per barrel in 2014 representing an unfavorable decrease of 419 per barrel we estimate that the narrowing of the discounts for sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately 260 million and 770 million respectively 

 

 

 

the decrease of 105 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a 196 million decrease in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices 258 per mmbtu in 2015 compared to 436 per mmbtu in 2014 this decrease in energy costs was partially offset by a 47 million increase in employeerelated expenses primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and incentive compensation expenses and a 26 million increase in costs associated with higher levels of maintenance activities in 2015 

the increase of 148 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with the impact of new capital projects that began operating in 2015 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization 

ethanol 

ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased 590 million  for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a 628 million  decrease in gross margin partially offset by a 39 million  decrease in operating expenses 

the decrease in ethanol segment gross margin of 628 million  was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

the 39 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a 40 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices 258 per mmbtu in 2015 compared to 436 per mmbtu in 2014 

other 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” increased by 36 million in 2015 this increase was primarily due to the impact from 125 billion of debt issued by valero and 200 million borrowed by vlp under its 750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement the vlp revolver in 2015 

income tax expense increased 93 million in 2015 this increase was lower than expected given the increase in income from continuing operations of 419 million and was primarily due to earnings from our international operations that are taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than in the us in addition in 2015 the uk statutory rate was lowered and we favorably settled various us income tax audits 

the loss from discontinued operations in 2014 includes expenses of 64 million primarily related to an asset retirement obligation associated with our decision in may 2014 to abandon the aruba refinery as further described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016   

our operations generated 48 billion  of cash in 2016  driven primarily by net income of 24 billion  net noncash charges to income of 14 billion  and a positive change in working capital of 976 million  noncash charges include 19 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense 56 million  for the asset impairment loss associated with our aruba terminal and 230 million  of deferred income tax expense partially offset by a benefit of 747 million  from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations the change in our working capital is further detailed in note 17  of notes to consolidated financial statements this source of cash mainly resulted from 

 

the 48 billion  of cash generated by our operations along with 22 billion  in proceeds from the issuance of debt including 125 billion  of 34 percent senior notes due september 15 2026  500 million  of 4375 percent senior notes due december 15 2026 issued by vlp and borrowings under the vlp revolver of 349 million  as discussed in note 8  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2015   

our operations generated 56 billion  of cash in 2015  driven primarily by net income of 41 billion  and net noncash charges to income of 28 billion  noncash charges include 18 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense 790 million  from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and 165 million  of deferred income tax expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations however the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of 13 billion  as shown in note 17  of notes to consolidated financial statements this use of cash mainly resulted from 



 

the 56 billion  of cash generated by our operations in 2015  along with i 145 billion  in proceeds from the issuance of debt and ii net proceeds of 189 million  from vlp’s public offering of 4250000 common units as discussed in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2014   

our operations generated 42 billion  of cash in 2014  driven primarily by net income of 37 billion  and 22 billion  of noncash charges to income noncash charges include 17 billion  of depreciation and amortization expense 63 million  of asset retirement and other expenses associated with our aruba refinery and 445 million  of deferred income tax expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations however the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of 18 billion  as shown in note 17  of notes to consolidated financial statements this use of cash mainly resulted from 

 

the 42 billion  of cash generated by our operations in 2014  along with 603 million  from available cash on hand were used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

we define capital investments as capital expenditures for additions to and improvements of our refining and ethanol segment assets including turnaround and catalyst costs and investments in joint ventures 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and 

betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

we hold equitymethod investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations in december 2015 we exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in diamond pipeline llc diamond pipeline which was formed by plains all american pipeline lp plains to construct and operate a 440mile 20inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200000 bpd of domestic sweet crude oil from the plains cushing oklahoma terminal to our memphis refinery with the ability to connect into the capline pipeline the pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated 925 million  we have contributed 138 million  in diamond pipeline and expect to continue making contributions as the construction progresses 

for 2017  we expect to incur approximately 27 billion for capital investments including capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst costs and equitymethod joint venture investments this consists of approximately 16 billion for stayinbusiness capital and 11 billion for growth strategies including our continued investment in diamond pipeline this capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  are summarized below in millions 



 

 

in october 2016 we entered into agreements to lease storage tanks located at three of our refineries the leases commenced in january 2017  the lease agreements will be accounted for as capital leases and we expect to recognize capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately 490 million  these capital 

lease agreements have initial terms of 10 years each and each agreement has successive 10 year automatic renewal terms 

debt and capital lease obligations 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis in july 2016 we amended our agreement to decrease the facility from 14 billion  to 13 billion  and extended the maturity date to july 2017  as of december 31 2016  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 100 million  all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined petroleum products and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed 

or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2016  

summary of credit facilities 

as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding borrowings letters of credit issued and availability under our credit facilities as follows in millions 



letters of credit issued as of december 31 2016  expire in 2017 through 2018 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

on september 21 2016 our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional 25 billion  of our outstanding common stock the 2016 program with no expiration date this authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a 25 billion  program authorized on july 13 2015  the 2015 program as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 25 billion  remaining available under the 2015 program and the 2016 program but we have no obligation to make purchases under these programs 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 28 million  to our pension plans and 19 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2017  

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and 

regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “outlook” in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see notes   7  and 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

during 2016 we settled the audit related to our us federal income tax returns for 2008 and 2009 the irs has ongoing tax audits related to our us federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2014 and we have received revenue agent reports rars in connection with the 2010 and 2011 audit we are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the rars and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the irs we believe that the ultimate settlement of these audits will not be material to our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

we operate in countries outside the us through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the us in the form of cash dividends should we decide to repatriate such earnings we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated in addition such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations as further discussed in note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe however that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the us without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings as of december 31 2016  22 billion  of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future the adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements except as otherwise disclosed 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

lower of cost or market inventory valuation 

inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market cost is principally determined under the lifo method using the dollarvalue lifo approach market value is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories 

we compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis excluding materials and supplies in determining the market value of our inventories we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks are converted into refined petroleum products which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined petroleum products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined petroleum products we also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale we then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories if the aggregate market value is less than cost we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to reflect our inventories at market value 

the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 are discussed in note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

property plant and equipment 

depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group and such evaluations consist of but are not limited to the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained assessment of the need to replace assets and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years 

under the composite method of depreciation the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications design standards and practices accepted in our industry and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives therefore we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group it should be noted however that factors such as competition regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting depreciation expense in the future 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies 

the amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of december 31 2016  and 2015  are included in note 7  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forwardlooking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2016  was 550 percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was 777 percent 146 percent and 733 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the 

following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2017  in millions 



beginning in 2016 our net periodic benefit cost is determined using the spotrate approach under this approach our net periodic benefit cost is impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate if the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged our net periodic benefit cost would increase by 18 million for pension benefits and 2 million for other postretirement benefits in 2017 

see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax matters 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to an indirect tax exciseduty salesuse gross receipts andor valueadded tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised see note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined products 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks historically refining margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of refined product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products and they could decline in the future which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of fuels including gasoline and diesel certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct 

assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example the us environmental protection agency epa has in recent years adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and the us epa is considering further revisions to the naaqs emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities which may result in increased capital expenditures governmental regulations regarding ghg emissions–including socalled “capandtrade” programs targeted at reducing carbon dioxide emissions–and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business and an increase in the cost of and reduction in demand for the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

in addition in 2015 the us canada and the uk participated in the united nations conference on climate change which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement will be open for signing on april 22 2016 and will require countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various us states or at the us federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry 

finally some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg emissions in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts and floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations  

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture 

we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailment collision fire explosion governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture  

we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets we own and lease rail cars for our operations rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance for example in may 2014 the us department of transportation dot issued an order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil in addition in november 2014 the us dot issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews in may 2015 the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the federal railroad administration issued new final rules for enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for highhazard flammable trains although we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity further changes in law regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and following the separation of our retail business we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings fitch on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business 

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in a loss of sensitive business information systems interruption or the disruption of our business operations there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax 

liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership vlp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to vlp liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

if our spinoff of cst the “spinoff” or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes then we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability 

we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares qualified as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff qualified for favorable treatment the irs did not rule however on whether the spinoff satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code instead the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling in connection with the private letter ruling we also obtained an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code the opinion relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail furthermore notwithstanding the private letter ruling the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete or that the spinoff or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spinoff 

if the spinoff ultimately were determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spinoff generally would be treated as receiving a spinoff of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder any such spinoff would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013 and any accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such holder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain in addition we would 

recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spinoff date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock moreover we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff were taxable 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spinoff we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spinoff andor certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment however if the spinoff andor such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries cst would be responsible for all such taxes if we were to become liable for taxes under the tax matters agreement that liability could have a material adverse effect on us the spinoff is more fully described in note 3  of notes to consolidated financial statements

overview and outlook 

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2015  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 40 billion  or 799 per share assuming dilution compared to 37 billion  or 697 per share assuming dilution for the year ended december 31 2014  included in our 2015 results was a noncash charge for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment recorded in december 2015 of 790 million  624 million after taxes or 125 per share assuming dilution of which 740 million  was attributable to our refining segment and 50 million  was attributable to our ethanol segment this matter is more fully described in note 6  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in our 2014 results was a lastin firstout lifo inventory gain of 233 million 151 million after taxes or 029 per share assuming dilution primarily related to our refining segment 

our operating income increased 456 million  from 2014 to 2015 as outlined by business segment in the following table in millions 



however excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and the lifo gain discussed above total operating income for 2015 and 2014 was 71 billion and 57 billion respectively reflecting a 14 billion favorable increase between the years with refining segment operating income of 77 billion  and 56 billion respectively a favorable increase of 21 billion  and ethanol segment operating income of 192 million  and 782 million  an unfavorable decrease of 590 million  

the 21 billion  increase in refining segment operating income in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to higher margins on gasoline and other refined products  eg  petroleum coke propane sulfur and lubes partially offset by lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to brent crude oil and lower distillate margins our ethanol segment operating income decreased 590 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower ethanol margins that resulted from lower ethanol and coproduct prices partially offset by lower corn feedstock costs 

additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income of our business segments and other components of net income attributable to valero stockholders are provided below under “results of operations” 

in march 2015 we issued 600 million  of 365 percent senior notes due march 15 2025  and 650 million  of 49 percent senior notes due march 15 2045  and our consolidated subsidiary vlp borrowed 200 million  under its revolving credit facility the vlp revolver as further described in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements on july 1 2015  vlp repaid 25 million  of the amount borrowed under the vlp revolver 

on july 13 2015 our board of directors authorized us to purchase an additional 25 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date to such authorization and we had 13 billion remaining available under that authorization as of december 31 2015  

effective november 24 2015  vlp completed a public offering of 4250000 common units at a price of 4625 per unit and received net proceeds from the offering of 189 million  after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs this transaction is further described in note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

energy markets and margins were volatile during 2015 and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the 2016 below is a summary of factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2016

general 

operating revenues decreased  430 billion  or 33 percent and cost of sales decreased 443 billion  or 37 percent for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs respectively despite the decrease in operating revenues cost of sales decreased to a greater extent resulting in an increase in operating income of 456 million  in 2015  with refining segment operating income increasing by 11 billion  and ethanol segment operating income decreasing by 644 million  the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and corporate expenses as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment operating income increased 11 billion  from 59 billion  in 2014  to 70 billion  in 2015  excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of 740 million  in 2015 and the lifo gain of 229 million  in 2014 our refining segment operating income increased 21 billion  this increase was primarily due to a 21 billion  or 192 per barrel increase in refining margin and a 105 million  decrease in operating expenses partially offset by a 148 million  increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

the increase in refining margin of 21 billion was due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

to 279 per barrel in 2014  representing an unfavorable decrease of 042 per barrel another example is maya crude oil a type of sour crude oil that sold at a discount of 954 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2015  compared to a discount of 1373 per barrel in 2014  representing an unfavorable decrease of 419 per barrel we estimate that the narrowing of the discounts for sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed during 2015  had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately 260 million and 770 million respectively 

 

 

 

the decrease of 105 million  in operating expenses was primarily due to a 196 million decrease in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices  258 per mmbtu in 2015  compared to 436 per mmbtu in 2014  this decrease in energy costs was partially offset by a 47 million increase in employeerelated expenses primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and incentive compensation expenses and a 26 million increase in costs associated with higher levels of maintenance activities in 2015  

the increase of 148 million  in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with the impact of new capital projects that began operating in 2015 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 142 million  in 2015  compared to 786 million  in 2014  excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of 50 million  in 2015 and the lifo gain of 4 million  in 2014 our ethanol segment operating income decreased 590 million  this decrease was primarily due to a 628 million  or 057 per gallon decrease in gross margin partially offset by a 39 million  decrease in operating expenses 

the decrease in ethanol gross margin of 628 million was due primarily to the following 

 

gallon in 2015  compared to 237 per gallon in 2014  we estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2015  had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately 800 million 

 

 

 

the 39 million  decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a 40 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices  258 per mmbtu in 2015  compared to 436 per mmbtu in 2014  

other 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” increased by 36 million  in 2015  this increase was primarily due to the impact from 125 billion  of debt issued by valero and 200 million  borrowed by vlp under the vlp revolver in 2015 

income tax expense increased 93 million  in 2015  this increase was lower than expected given the increase in income from continuing operations of 419 million and was due primarily to earnings from our international operations that are taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than in the us in addition in 2015  the uk statutory rate was lowered and we favorably settled various us income tax audits 

the loss from discontinued operations in 2014  includes expenses of 64 million  primarily related to an asset retirement obligation associated with our decision in may 2014 to abandon the aruba refinery as further described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

2014  compared to 2013

general 

operating revenues decreased 72 billion or 5 percent for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices in all of our regions despite the decline in operating revenues operating income increased 19 billion in 2014  due primarily to a 17 billion  increase in refining segment operating income a 295 million  increase in ethanol segment operating income and a 34 million decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by an 81 million decrease in retail segment operating income due to the spinoff of our retail business in 2013 as mentioned previously the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment operating income increased 17 billion from 42 billion in 2013 to 59 billion in 2014  excluding the lifo gain of 229 million  in 2014  related to our refining segment our refining segment operating income increased by 14 billion  this increase was primarily due to a 17 billion or 136 per barrel increase in refining margin partially offset by a 190 million increase in operating expenses and a 31 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

the increase in refining margin of 17 billion was due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the increase of 190 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a 128 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas prices 436 per mmbtu in 2014  compared to 369 per mmbtu in 2013 and a 22 million increase in maintenance expense primarily related to higher levels of routine maintenance activities in 2014  

the increase of 31 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to additional depreciation expense of 25 million associated with the new hydrocracker unit at our st charles refinery that began operating in july 2013 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 786 million in 2014  compared to 491 million in 2013 the 295 million increase in operating income was due primarily to a 399 million or 029 per gallon increase in gross margin partially offset by a 100 million increase in operating expenses 

the increase in ethanol gross margin of 399 million was due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

the 100 million increase in operating expenses in 2014  was partially due to 22 million in operating expenses of the mount vernon plant acquired in march 2014 the remaining increase of 78 million was primarily due to increased energy costs and chemical costs the increase in energy costs of 57 million was due primarily to the severe winter weather in the us in the first quarter of 2014 that caused a significant increase in regional natural gas prices combined with higher use of natural gas due to the increase in production volumes the increase in chemical costs of 16 million was due to higher production volumes 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses decreased 34 million in 2014  primarily due to 30 million of transaction costs in 2013 related to the separation of our retail business on may 1 2013 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 24 million primarily due to a 20 million loss on the sale of certain corporate property in 2013 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” increased 32 million in 2014  this increase was primarily due to a 48 million decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of several large capital projects during 2013 including the new hydrocracker at our st charles refinery partially offset by a 20 million favorable impact from a decrease in average borrowings 

income tax expense increased 523 million in 2014  due to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense the effective rate for both years is lower than the us statutory rate because income from continuing operations from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the us and due to a higher benefit from our us manufacturing deduction 

income loss from discontinued operations in 2014  includes expenses of 59 million for an asset retirement obligation and 4 million for certain contractual obligations associated with our decision in may 2014 to abandon the aruba refinery as further described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2015 

our operations generated 56 billion  of cash in 2015  driven primarily by net income of 41 billion  and excluding 26 billion of noncash charges to income  18 billion  for depreciation and amortization expense and 790 million  for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations however the change in working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of 13 billion  this use of cash was composed primarily of i a decrease in accounts payable net of a decrease in receivables of 493 million  ii an increase in income taxes receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable totaling 432 million  and iii an increase in inventories of 222 million  as shown in note 18  of notes to consolidated financial statements the unfavorable effect of accounts payable net of accounts receivable was mainly due to a decrease in commodity prices from december 2014  to december 2015  the unfavorable effect in income taxes was due to tax payments associated with the settlement of several irs audits and an overpayment of taxes in 2015 this overpayment resulted from a change in the us federal tax laws late in the year that reinstated the bonus depreciation deduction which lowered our current income tax expense the unfavorable effect in inventories was mainly due to the build in inventory volumes in 2015 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2015 

the 56 billion  of cash generated by our operations in 2015  along with i 145 billion  in proceeds from the issuance of debt and ii net proceeds of 189 million  from vlp’s public offering of 4250000  common units as discussed in note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to

our operations generated 42 billion  of cash in 2014  driven primarily by net income of 37 billion  and excluding 17 billion  of noncash charges to income primarily depreciation and amortization expense see “results of operations” for further discussion of our operations however the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of 18 billion  this use of cash was composed primarily of a decrease in accounts receivable of 28 billion  which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable of 31 billion  a decrease in income taxes payable of 319 million  and an increase in inventories of 10 billion  as shown in note 18  of notes to consolidated financial statements the favorable effect in accounts receivable and the unfavorable effect in accounts payable were mainly due to a decrease in commodity prices from december 2013  to december 2014  the unfavorable effect associated with income taxes payable resulted from income tax payments exceeding income tax liabilities incurred in 2014  due to the payment of liabilities associated with prior period earnings the unfavorable effect in inventories was mainly due to the build in inventory volumes from 2013 to 2014 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2014 

the 42 billion  of cash provided by our operations in 2014  along with 603 million  from available cash on hand was used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

we define capital investments as capital expenditures for additions to and improvements of our refining and ethanol segment assets including turnaround and catalyst costs and investments in joint ventures 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

we hold investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations in december 2015 we exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in diamond pipeline llc diamond pipeline which was formed by plains pipeline lp plains to construct and operate a 440mile 20inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200000 bpd of domestic sweet crude oil from the plains cushing oklahoma terminal to our memphis refinery with the ability to connect into the capline pipeline the pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated 925 million  pending receipt of necessary regulatory approvals we contributed 136 million  upon exercise of our option and expect to invest an additional 170 million in 2016 

for 2016 we expect to incur approximately 26 billion for capital investments including capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst costs and joint venture investments this consists of approximately 16 billion for stayinbusiness capital and 10 billion for growth strategies including our continued investment in diamond pipeline this capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  are summarized below in millions 



 

 

debt and capital lease obligations 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis in july 2015 we amended our agreement to decrease the facility from 15 billion to 14 billion and extended the maturity date to july 2016 as of december 31 2015 the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to 11 billion primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade receivables as a result of the ongoing decline in the market prices of the finished products that we produce as of december 31 2015  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 100 million  all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined products and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or 

remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2015  

summary of credit facilities 

as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under our credit facilities as follows in millions 



letters of credit issued as of december 31 2015  expire in 2016 through 2018 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

on july 13 2015 our board of directors authorized us to purchase an additional 25 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date to such authorization this authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a 3 billion program previously authorized during the third quarter of 2015 we completed our purchases under the 3 billion program as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 13 billion  remaining available under the 25 billion  program but we have no obligation to make purchases under this program 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 36 million  to our pension plans and 20 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2016  

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures ghg emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “outlook” in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see notes   9  and 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

the irs has ongoing tax audits related to our us federal tax returns from 2008 through 2011 and we have received revenue agent reports rars in connection with the audits for tax years 2008 and 2009 we are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the rars and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the irs during 2015  we settled the audits related to our 2004 through 2007 tax years consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits in addition we expect to settle our audit for tax years 2008 and 2009 within the next 12 months and we believe it will be settled for amounts consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with that audit as a result we have classified a portion of our uncertain tax position liabilities as a current liability our net uncertain tax position liabilities including related penalties and interest was 391 million  as of december 31 2015  should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

we operate in countries outside the us through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the us in the form of cash dividends should we decide to repatriate such earnings we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated in addition such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations as further discussed in note 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe however that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the us without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings as of december 31 2015  17 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries 

emissions allowances and capandtrade 

the cost to implement certain provisions of the ab 32 capandtrade system and low carbon fuel standard in california and the quebec capandtrade system are significant however we are recovering the majority of these costs from our customers if we are unable to recover these costs from our customers in the future we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand to cover these costs 

concentration of customers 

our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future the adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements except as otherwise disclosed 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable unless otherwise noted estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved and the wide range of possible outcomes 

lower of cost or market inventory valuation 

inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market cost is principally determined under the lifo method using the dollarvalue lifo approach market value is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories 

we compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis excluding materials and supplies in determining the market value of our inventories we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks 

are converted into refined products which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products we also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale we then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories if the aggregate market value is less than cost we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to reflect our inventories at market value 

the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended december 31 2015 is discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

property plant and equipment 

depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group and such evaluations consist of but are not limited to the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained assessment of the need to replace assets and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years 

under the composite method of depreciation the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications design standards and practices accepted in our industry and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives therefore we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group it should be noted however that factors such as competition regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting depreciation expense in the future 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies 

the amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of december 31 2015  and 2014  are included in note 9  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 13  of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forwardlooking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2015  was 569 percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  was 146 percent 733 percent and 1938 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2016  in millions 



beginning in 2016 our net periodic benefit cost will be determined using the spotrate approach under this approach our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate if the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged our net periodic benefit cost would increase by 19 million for pension benefits and 3 million for other postretirement benefits in 2016 

see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax matters 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to an indirect tax exciseduty salesuse gross receipts andor valueadded tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised see notes 11  and 15  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil refined products primarily gasoline and distillate grain primarily corn and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including swaps futures and options to manage the volatility of 

 

we use the futures markets for the available liquidity which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk in millions 



see note 20  of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2015  

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and ghg emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs to manage these risks we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable some of these contracts are derivative instruments however we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values as of december 31 2015  there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts see note 20  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt obligations dollars in millions the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2015  or 2014  





 

 

foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2015  we had commitments to purchase 292 million  of us dollars our market risk was minimal on these contracts as all of them matured on or before january 31 2016 resulting in a gain of 10 million  in the first quarter of 2016

approximately 46 percent of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market our term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at marketrelated prices directly or indirectly from various national oil companies as well as international and us oil companies the contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts or terminate them effective as of the next scheduled renewal date by giving the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time  eg  60 days 6 months before expiration of the current term the majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer’s official stated price  ie  the “market” price established by the seller for all purchasers and not at a negotiated price specific to us 

refining segment sales 

overview 

our refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets these sales include refined products that are manufactured in our refining operations as well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties most of our refineries have access to marine transportation facilities and interconnect with commoncarrier pipeline systems allowing us to sell products in the us canada the uk and other countries no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total operating revenues in 2014 

wholesale marketing 

we market branded and unbranded refined products on a wholesale basis through an extensive rack marketing network the principal purchasers of our refined products from terminal truck racks are wholesalers distributors retailers and truckdelivered end users throughout the us canada the uk and ireland 

the majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels the remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the valerobrand family that operate approximately 5600 branded sites in the us and the caribbean approximately 1000 branded sites in the uk and ireland and approximately 800 branded sites in canada these sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multiyear contracts for wholesale branded sites we promote the valero ®  beacon ®  and shamrock ®  brands in the us and the caribbean the ultramar ®  brand in canada and the texaco ®  brand in the uk and ireland 

bulk sales and trading 

we sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels in us and international markets our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain bulk endusers such as railroads airlines and utilities our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline barges and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs 

we also enter into refined product exchange and purchase agreements these agreements help minimize transportation costs optimize refinery utilization balance refined product availability broaden geographic distribution and provide access to markets not connected to our refinedproduct pipeline systems exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and thirdparties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations

specialty products 

we sell a variety of other products produced at our refineries which we refer to collectively as “specialty products” our specialty products include asphalt lube oils natural gas liquids ngls petroleum coke petrochemicals and sulfur 

 

logistics and transportation 

we own several transportation and logistics assets crude oil pipelines refined product pipelines terminals tanks marine docks truck rack bays rail cars and rail facilities that support our refining and ethanol operations in addition through subsidiaries we own 100 percent of the general partner interest of valero energy partners lp vlp and approximately 70 percent of its limited partner interests vlp is a midstream master limited partnership its common units representing limited partner interests are traded on the nyse under the symbol “vlp” its assets support the operations of our port arthur mckee three rivers ardmore and memphis refineries vlp is discussed more fully in note 5  of notes to consolidated financial statements

ethanol 

we own 11  ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of about 13 billion gallons per year our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities 1 that process corn to produce ethanol and distillers grains 2 we source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators our facilities receive corn primarily by rail and truck we publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to use to facilitate corn supply transactions 

after processing our ethanol is held in storage tanks onsite pending loading to trucks and rail cars we sell our ethanol i to large customers – primarily refiners and gasoline blenders – under term and spot contracts and ii in bulk markets such as new york chicago the us gulf coast florida and the us west coast we ship our dry distillers grains ddg by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the us and mexico with some sales into the far east we also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites 

the following table presents the locations of our ethanol plants their approximate ethanol and ddg production capacities and their approximate corn processing capacities 



  

the combined production of denatured ethanol from our plants in 2014 averaged 34 million  gallons per day

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins which are dependent upon factors beyond our control including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined products 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks historically refining margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined products these in turn depend on among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of us and international suppliers levels of refined product inventories productivity and growth or the lack thereof of us and global economies us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly adding to market volatility while others may have longerterm effects the longerterm effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined products price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories 

economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities including the threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the us and other countries lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 

refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined product demand which would have an adverse effect on refining margins 

a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils such as louisiana light sweet lls and brent crude oils these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products and they could decline in the future which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws including proposed climate change laws and regulations could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline 

 12 

and diesel fuels certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or thirdparty sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken regardless of negligence or fault if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned 

because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits material changes in operations increased capital expenditures and operating costs increased costs of the goods we sell and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

for example the us environmental protection agency epa has in recent years adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and the us epa is considering further revisions to the naaqs emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities which may result in increased capital expenditures governmental restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including socalled “capandtrade” programs targeted at reducing carbon dioxide emissions – could result in material increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business and an increase in the cost of and reduction in demand for the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations    

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east africa asia north america and south america we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from these areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

in addition the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries these restrictions and those of other governments could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries actions by both the us and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future 

we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on thirdparty transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture 

we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market or if the ability of the pipelines vessels or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events accidents derailment collision fire explosion 

 13 

governmental regulations or thirdparty actions it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture  

we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets we own and lease rail cars for our operations rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal state and local regulations new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance for example in 2014 the us department of transportation dot and transport canada tc issued proposed regulations for rail car standards and railroad operating requirements for flammable liquids with particular emphasis on shipments of crude oil gasoline and ethanol the regulations as proposed would require significant physical modifications to rail cars we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with these and other future regulations of rail transportation to the extent they are applicable to us 

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks own their own retail sites have greater financial resources or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage  

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and following the separation of our retail business we do not have a companyowned retail network many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have extensive retail sites such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners 

our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders commodity hedging counterparties or our customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us in addition decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements 

our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we currently maintain investmentgrade ratings by standard  poor’s ratings services sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings fitch on our senior unsecured debt ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be 

 14 

evaluated independently of any other rating we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant specifically if ratings agencies were to downgrade our longterm rating particularly below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease in addition we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral letters of credit or other forms of security which would increase our operating costs as a result a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

from time to time our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities from time to time we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities we have existing revolving credit facilities committed letter of credit facilities and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs in addition we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business   

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate 

a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business   

our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack which could result in a loss of sensitive business information systems interruption or the disruption of our business operations there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages slowdowns or strikes by our employees as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators 

workers at various of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike work stoppage or other labor action any prolonged strike work stoppage or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in addition future 

 15 

federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs especially during critical maintenance periods 

we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and liquidity  

our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and natural catastrophes as protection against these hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all potential losses and liabilities we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example coverage for hurricane damage is very limited and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions including insurance companies we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events 

large capital projects can take many years to complete and market conditions could deteriorate over time negatively impacting project returns 

we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project largescale projects take many years to complete and market conditions can change from our forecast as a result we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns which could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance  

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forwardcontract activities and derivative transactions  

we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to continue their use in the future if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective we may incur losses in addition we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us 

 16 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership vlp which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 

one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp a publicly traded master limited partnership our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to vlp liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

if our spinoff of cst the “spinoff” or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff were determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes then we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability 

we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares qualified as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended code and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff qualified for favorable treatment the irs did not rule however on whether the spinoff satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code instead the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling in connection with the private letter ruling we also obtained an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code the opinion relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail furthermore notwithstanding the private letter ruling the irs could determine on audit that the spinoff or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete or that the spinoff or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spinoff 

if the spinoff ultimately were determined to be taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spinoff generally would be treated as receiving a spinoff of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder any such spinoff would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013 and any accumulated earnings and profits any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such holder’s tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain in addition we would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spinoff date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock moreover we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff were taxable 

under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spinoff we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spinoff andor certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment however if the spinoff andor such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries cst would be responsible for all such taxes if we were to become liable

overview and outlook 

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2014  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 37 billion  or 697 per share assuming dilution compared to 27 billion  or 496 per share assuming dilution for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase of 980 million  was due primarily to the increase of 19 billion  in our operating income as shown in the table below the increase in our operating income was partially offset by a 325 million  nontaxable gain recorded in 2013 related to the disposition of our retained interest in cst which is more fully described in notes 3  and 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our operating income increased 19 billion  from 2013  to 2014  as outlined by business segment in the following table in millions 



the 17 billion  increase in refining segment operating income for 2014 compared to 2013 was due to wider discounts for sweet and sour crude oils relative to brent crude oil higher throughput volumes in our us gulf coast region and higher margins on other refined products  eg  petroleum coke and sulfur partially offset by weaker distillate margins higher energy costs and depreciation expense between the periods also impacted our refining segment income our ethanol segment operating income increased 295 million  in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower corn feedstock costs and higher production volumes partially offset by lower coproduct prices and lower ethanol prices 

on may 1 2013 we completed the separation of our retail business by spinning off cst as an independent public company therefore we did not have any retail segment operations in 2014 resulting in the 81 million decrease in retail segment operating income in 2014 compared to 2013 

additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income of our business segments and other components of net income attributable to valero stockholders are provided below under “results of operations”

operating revenues decreased  72 billion  or 5 percent for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices in all of our regions despite the decline in operating revenues operating income increased 19 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  due primarily to a 17 billion  increase in refining segment operating income a 295 million  increase in ethanol segment operating income and a 34 million  decrease in general and administrative expenses partially offset by an 81 million decrease in retail segment operating income due to the spinoff of our retail business in 2013 as mentioned previously the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment operating income increased 17 billion  from 42 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2013  to 59 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2014  due primarily to a 19 billion  increase in refining margin partially offset by a 190 million  increase in operating expenses and a 31 million  increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

refining margin increased 19 billion  a 159 per barrel increase in 2014  compared to 2013  due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

 

 32 

2013  we estimate that the increase in other refinery products margins during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately 430 million 

 

the increase of 190 million  in operating expenses was primarily due to a 128 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas prices  436 per mmbtu for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 369 per mmbtu for the year ended december 31 2013  and a 22 million increase in maintenance expense primarily related to higher levels of routine maintenance activities during the year ended december 31 2014  

the increase of 31 million  in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to additional depreciation expense of 25 million associated with the new hydrocracker unit at our st charles refinery that began operating in july 2013 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 786 million  for the year  ended december 31 2014  compared to 491 million  for the year  ended december 31 2013  the 295 million  increase in operating income was due primarily to a 399 million  increase in gross margin a 029 per gallon increase partially offset by a 100 million  increase in operating expenses 

ethanol gross margin per gallon increased to 106 per gallon for the year ended december 31 2014  from 077 per gallon for the year ended december 31 2013  due primarily to the following 

 

 

 

 33 

the 100 million  increase in operating expenses during 2014  compared to 2013  was partially due to 22 million in operating expenses of the mount vernon plant acquired in march 2014 the remaining increase of 78 million was primarily due to increased energy costs and chemical costs the increase in energy costs of 57 million was due primarily to the severe winter weather in the us in the first quarter of 2014 that caused a significant increase in regional natural gas prices combined with higher use of natural gas due to the increase in production volumes the increase in chemical costs of 16 million was due to higher production volumes 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses decreased 34 million  from the year  ended december 31 2013  to the year  ended december 31 2014  primarily due to 30 million of transaction costs related to the separation of our retail business on may 1 2013 that were recorded in 2013 and did not recur 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 24 million  primarily due to a 20 million loss on the sale of certain corporate property in 2013 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for the year  ended december 31 2014  increased 32 million  from the year  ended december 31 2013  this increase was primarily due to a 48 million  decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of several large capital projects during 2013 including the new hydrocracker at our st charles refinery partially offset by a 20 million favorable impact from a decrease in average borrowings 

income tax expense increased 523 million  from the year  ended december 31 2013  to the year  ended december 31 2014  due to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense the effective rate for both years is lower than the us statutory rate because income from continuing operations from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the us and due to a higher benefit from our us manufacturing deduction 

income loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014  includes expenses of 59 million  for an asset retirement obligation and 4 million  for certain contractual obligations associated with our decision in may 2014 to abandon the aruba refinery as further described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements

general 

operating revenues decreased 319 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two years related to our refining segment operations in addition operating income decreased 11 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 primarily due to a 13 billion  decrease in refining segment operating income a 267 million decrease in retail segment operating income and a 60 million increase in general and administrative expenses partially offset by a 538 million increase in ethanol segment operating income the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment operating income decreased 13 billion  from 55 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012 to 42 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 the decrease in refining segment operating income was primarily due to an 855 million  decrease in refining margin a 221 million  increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a 197 million  increase in operating expenses 

refining margin decreased 855 million  a 131 per barrel decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 40 

 

 

the increase of 197 million  in operating expenses was primarily due to a 185 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas costs and higher use of natural gas associated with our new hydrocracker units at our port arthur and st   charles refineries 

the increase of 221 million  in depreciation and amortization expense was due to additional depreciation expense primarily associated with our new hydrocracker units at our port arthur and st charles refineries that began operating in late 2012 and the third quarter of 2013 respectively and an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail segment operating income was 81 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 348 million for the year december 31 2012 the 267 million decrease was primarily due to the separation of our retail business on may 1 2013 which is more fully described in note 3  of notes to consolidated financial statements as a result of the separation retail segment operating income for 2013 reflects the operations of our former retail business for only the first four months of 2013 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 491 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to an operating loss of 47 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the 538 million increase in operating income was primarily due to a 596 million increase in gross margin partially offset by a 55 million increase in operating expenses 

ethanol gross margin per gallon increased 047 per gallon from 030 per gallon in 2012 to 077 per gallon in 2013 due to the following 

 

 

 41 

described above by mid2013 ethanol inventory levels in the us had declined to their lowest level in over three years and as a result prices increased significantly beginning late in the first quarter of 2013 for example the new york harbor ethanol price was 253 per gallon in 2013 compared to 237 per gallon in 2012 the increase in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2013 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately 160 million 

 

the 55 million increase in operating expenses during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a 40 million increase in energy costs compared to 2012 resulting from higher natural gas prices during 2013 and a 12 million year over year increase in chemical costs due to higher production 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 60 million from the year ended december 31 2012 to the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to 52 million of environmental and legal reserve adjustments that were recorded during 2013 and 30 million for transaction costs related to the separation of our retail business on may 1 2013 these increases were partially offset by an 11 million reduction in insurance reserves during 2013 the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to 20 million of losses incurred on the sale of certain corporate property 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized a nontaxable gain of 325 million or 060 per share related to the disposition of our retained interest in cst which is more fully described in notes 3  and 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 51 million  from the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was primarily due to a 102 million decrease in capitalized interest due to completion of several large capital projects including the new hydrocrackers at our port arthur and st charles refineries offset by a 44 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings and a 12 million writeoff of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012 

income tax expense decreased 372 million from the year ended december 31 2012 to the year ended december 31 2013 the variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily due to the nontaxable gain on the disposition of our retained interest in cst 

loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2012 represents the results of operations of the aruba refinery which was abandoned in may 2014 including an asset impairment loss of 928 million as discussed in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 42 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2014 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year  ended december 31 2014  was 42 billion  compared to 56 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2013  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a 27 billion  unfavorable effect from changes in working capital between the periods partially offset by the increase in income from continuing operations discussed above under “results of operations” the changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  are shown in note 19  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the net cash provided by operating activities during the year  ended december 31 2014  along with 603 million  from available cash on hand was used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year  ended december 31 2013  was 56 billion  compared to 53 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2012  changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2013  combined with 735 million  of net cash received in connection with the separation of our retail business consisting of 550 million  of proceeds on shortterm debt a 500 million  cash distribution from cst less 315 million  of cash retained by cst and 525 million  of proceeds on shortterm debt related to the disposition of our retained interest in cst were used mainly to 

 

in addition vlp completed its initial public offering of common units for net proceeds of 369 million  because we consolidate vlp’s financial statements the total cash reported by us also increased by these net proceeds however such proceeds can only be used by vlp for its purposes 

capital investments 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

 43 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

for 2015 we expect to incur approximately 195 billion for capital expenditures and approximately 700 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions and joint venture arrangements we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

we hold an option until january 2016 to purchase a 50 percent interest in the diamond pipeline project a 440mile 20inch crude oil pipeline that is projected to provide capacity of up to 200000 bpd of domestic sweet crude oil from the plains cushing oklahoma terminal to our memphis refinery the diamond pipeline project is currently being constructed by a third party for an estimated 900 million and is expected to be completed in 2017 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  are summarized below in millions 



debt and capital lease obligations 

in february 2015 we made a scheduled debt repayment of 400 million  related to our 45  senior notes 

as of december 31 2014  we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis up to 15 billion in december 2014 the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to 14 billion primarily due to a decline in eligible trade receivables as a result of a decrease in the latter part of 2014 in the market prices of the finished products that we produce as of december 31 2014  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 100 million  all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt 

 44 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined products and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions purchase obligations decreased from 2013  to 2014  primarily because of a decline in crude oil and refined product prices 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2014  

 45 

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding letters of credit under our committed lines of credit as follows in millions 



as of december 31 2014  we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities the letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2014  expire in 2015 through 2017 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

as of december 31 2014  we have approvals under our 3 billion  common stock purchase program to purchase approximately 15 billion  of our common stock but we have no obligation to make purchases under this program year to date through february 20 2015  we have purchased one million  shares for 57 million  under this stock purchase program 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 47 million  to our pension plans and 20 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2015  

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in “outlook” in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see notes   10  and 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

during the year ended december   31 2014 we paid 16 billion  in income taxes of which 400 million related to 2013 that was recorded in income taxes payable as of december 31 2013 the payments made for the year ended december   31 2014 exceeded income taxes paid for 2013 by 800 million the increase in income taxes paid in 2014 is due in part to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense although the amount of cash required to pay our 2014 income taxes increased compared to recent years we generated and expect to continue generating sufficient cash from operations to make our tax payments as they become due 

 46 

the internal revenue service irs has ongoing tax audits related to our us federal tax returns from 2004 through 2011 and we have received revenue agent reports rars in connection with the audits for tax years 2004 through 2009 we are vigorously contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the rars and continue to make significant progress in resolving certain of these matters with the irs during the year  ended december 31 2014  we settled the audit related to our 2002 and 2003 tax years and the audit related to a group of our subsidiaries for their 2004 and 2005 tax years consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits in addition we expect to settle our audits for tax years 2004 through 2007 within the next 12 months and we believe they will be settled for amounts that do not exceed the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits as a result we have classified a portion of our uncertain tax position liabilities as a current liability as of december 31 2014  the total amount of uncertain tax position liabilities including related penalties and interest was 484 million  with 168 million  reflected as a current liability in income taxes payable and 316 million  reflected in other longterm liabilities should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

we operate in countries outside the us through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the us in the form of cash dividends should we decide to repatriate such earnings we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated in addition such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations as further discussed in note 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe however that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the us without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings as of december 31 2014  738 million of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries 

emissions allowances and capandtrade 

the cost to implement certain provisions of the ab 32 capandtrade system and low carbon fuel standard in california and the quebec capandtrade system may be significant however we expect to recover the majority of these costs from our customers 

concentration of customers 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

 47 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future the adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements except as otherwise disclosed 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1  of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

property plant and equipment 

depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group and such evaluations consist of but are not limited to the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained assessment of the need to replace assets and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years 

under the composite method of depreciation the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications design standards and practices accepted in our industry and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives therefore we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group it should be noted however that factors such as competition regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting depreciation expense in the future 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment intangible assets and deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our 

 48 

impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates see notes 2  and 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  is included in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 49 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates and these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forwardlooking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2014 was 771 percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  was 733 percent 1938 percent and 1184 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2015  in millions 



see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax matters 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to an indirect tax exciseduty salesuse gross receipts andor valueadded tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates 

 50 

or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes see notes 12  and 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

 51 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil refined products primarily gasoline and distillate grain primarily corn and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including swaps futures and options to hedge 

 

we use the futures markets for the available liquidity which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk in millions

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs to manage this risk we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable some of these contracts are derivative instruments however we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values as of december 31 2014  there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts see note 21  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments excluding capital lease obligations dollars in millions the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2014  and 2013  





foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2014  we had commitments to purchase 377 million  of us dollars our market risk was minimal on the contracts as the majority of them matured on or before january 31 2015  resulting in a gain of 12 million  in the first quarter of 2015

overview and outlook 

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2013  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders of 27 billion  or 497 per share assuming dilution compared to 21 billion  or 375 per share assuming dilution for the year ended december 31 2012  

the increase in net income attributable to valero stockholders of 637 million  was primarily due to the effect of asset impairment losses of 10 billion  recorded during the year ended december 31 2012  which lowered net income for 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  in addition during 2013  we recorded a 325 million  nontaxable gain related to the disposition of our retained interest in cst brands inc cst which is more fully described in notes 3 and 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding these significant items net income attributable to valero stockholders for 2013 declined by 702 million due primarily to lower refining segment operating income as discussed below 

our operating income decreased 47 million  from 2012  to 2013  as outlined by business segment in the following table in millions 



operating income for 2012 was negatively impacted by asset impairment losses of 10 billion  of which 928 million  related to our aruba refinery as further discussed in note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements and severance expense of 41 million  which was also related to our aruba refinery as further discussed in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding these significant items total operating income and refining segment operating income for 2012 would have been 51 billion and 55 billion respectively resulting in a 11 billion decrease in total operating income and a 13 billion  decrease in refining segment operating income from 2012 to 2013 

the 13 billion  decrease in refining segment operating income for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to lower refining margins in each of our regions the decrease in refining margins was the result of lower gasoline margins lower discounts on light sweet crude oils and higher costs of biofuel credits primarily renewable identification numbers rins needed to comply with the us federal renewable fuel standard rfs which were partially offset by higher distillate margins and higher discounts on sour crude oils between the years 

on may 1 2013 we completed the separation of our retail business by spinning off 80 percent of cst as an independent public company as a result we no longer operate a retail business and had no retail segment operating results after april 30 2013 resulting in the 267 million  decrease in retail segment operating income for 2013 compared to 2012 the separation of our retail business is more fully discussed in note 3  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 25 

our ethanol segment operating income in 2013 increased 538 million  compared to 2012 due to higher gross margin per gallon of ethanol and higher production volumes lower corn prices and higher ethanol prices contributed to the improved gross margin we increased our production of ethanol following the first quarter of 2013 to capture the improved economics of higher gross margins per gallon during 2013 

on december 16 2013  valero energy partners lp vlp completed its initial public offering of 17250000 common units at a price of 2300 per unit which included a 2250000   common unit overallotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters vlp received 369 million   in net proceeds from the sale of the units after deducting underwriting fees structuring fees and other offering costs vlp’s initial assets include crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal systems in the us gulf coast and us midcontinent regions that are integral to the operations of our port arthur mckee and memphis refineries see note 5  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

outlook 

our refining segment benefits from processing sour crude oils such as maya crude oil in our us gulf coast region and light sweet crude oils such as wti crude oil in our us midcontinent region due to the favorable discounts between the prices of these types of crude oil and the price of brent crude oil because the market for refined products generally tracks the price of brent crude oil which is a benchmark sweet crude oil we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to brent crude oil the discounts in the prices of light sweet and sour crude oils compared to the price of brent crude oil widened significantly during the fourth quarter of 2013 for the first quarter of 2014 discounts on light sweet and sour crude oils narrowed slightly compared to the fourth quarter and we expect these discounts to remain volatile for the remainder of the first quarter 

in addition gasoline margins across all regions were seasonally weak during the fourth quarter of 2013 and remain seasonally weak thus far in the first quarter of 2014 distillate margins across all regions thus far in 2014 have remained consistent with those realized during the fourth quarter of 2013 we are exposed to the volatility in the market prices of crude oil and refined products and we expect such prices to continue to be volatile in the near to midterm 

we are also exposed to the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits primarily rins in the us which we purchase in the open market to meet our obligation to blend biofuels into the products we produce to date during the first quarter of 2014 the market price of rins has increased compared to year end levels but the price remains lower than prices experienced during 2013 therefore we estimate that the cost of meeting our obligation for the full year of 2014 will be between 250 million and 350 million because the market price of rins is volatile and is significantly impacted by biofuel blending rates that are established by the epa it is difficult for us to predict reliably the market price of rins

 32 

general 

operating revenues decreased  12 billion  or 1 percent  for the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to the year  ended december 31 2012  primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two years related to our refining segment operations in addition operating income decreased 47 million  for the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to the year  ended december 31 2012  primarily due to a 233 million  decrease in refining segment operating income a 267 million  decrease in retail segment operating income and a 60 million  increase in general and administrative expenses partially offset by a 538 million  increase in ethanol segment operating income the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affected our income are discussed below 

refining 

refining segment operating income decreased 233 million  from 45 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2012  to 42 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2013  excluding asset impairment losses and severance expenses of 993 million  and 41 million  in 2012  primarily related to our aruba refinery which are more fully described in notes 4 and 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements respectively refining segment operating income decreased 13 billion  from 2012 to 2013 the decrease in refining segment operating income was primarily due to a 994 million  decrease in refining margin a 196 million  increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a 36 million  increase in operating expenses 

refining margin decreased 994 million  a 127 per barrel decrease in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 33 

result of increased production volumes of distillate between the years this production volume increase of 66000 barrels per day was primarily due to the start up of our new hydrocracker units at our port arthur and st charles refineries resulting in a 370 million increase in our refining margin in 2013  

 

the increase of 36 million  in operating expenses was primarily due to a 185 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas costs and higher use of natural gas associated with our new hydrocracker units at our port arthur and st charles refineries this increase was partially offset by a 124 million decrease in operating expenses incurred by the aruba refinery whose operations were suspended in march 2012 

the increase of 196 million  in depreciation and amortization expense was due to additional depreciation expense primarily associated with our new hydrocracker units at our port arthur and st charles refineries that began operating in late 2012 and the third quarter of 2013 respectively and an increase in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail segment operating income was 81 million  for the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to 348 million  for the year   december 31 2012  the 267 million  decrease was primarily due to the separation of our retail business on may 1 2013 which is more fully described in note 3  of notes to consolidated financial statements as a result of the separation retail segment operating income for 2013  reflects the operations of our former retail business for only the first four months of 2013 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 491 million  for the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to an operating loss of 47 million  for the year  ended december 31 2012  the 538 million  increase in operating income was primarily due to a 596 million  increase in gross margin partially offset by a 55 million  increase in operating expenses 

ethanol gross margin per gallon increased 047 per gallon from 030 per gallon in 2012  to 077 per gallon in 2013  due to the following 

 

 

 34 

continent described above by mid2013 ethanol inventory levels in the us had declined to their lowest level in over three years and as a result prices increased significantly beginning late in the first quarter of 2013 for example the new york harbor ethanol price was 253 per gallon in 2013  compared to 237 per gallon in 2012  the increase in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2013  had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately 160 million 

 

the 55 million  increase in operating expenses during 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily due to a 40 million increase in energy costs compared to 2012  resulting from higher natural gas prices during 2013 and a 12 million year over year increase in chemical costs due to higher production 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 60 million from the year  ended december 31 2012  to the year  ended december 31 2013  primarily due to 52 million of environmental and legal reserve adjustments that were recorded during 2013 and 30 million for transaction costs related to the separation of our retail business on may 1 2013 these increases were partially offset by an 11 million reduction in insurance reserves during 2013 the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to 20 million of losses incurred on the sale of certain corporate property 

during the year  ended december 31 2013  we recognized a nontaxable gain of 325 million or 060 per share related to the disposition of our retained interest in cst which is more fully described in note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for year  ended december 31 2013  increased 52 million  from the year  ended december 31 2012  this increase was primarily due to a 103 million  decrease in capitalized interest due to completion of several large capital projects including the new hydrocrackers at our port arthur and st charles refineries offset by a 44 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings and a 12 million writeoff of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012 

income tax expense decreased 372 million  from the year  ended december 31 2012  to the year  ended december 31 2013  the variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily due to the nontaxable gain on the disposition of our retained interest in cst the variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income before income tax expense for 2012 was primarily due to not recognizing the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment loss of 928 million and the severance expense of 41 million related to the aruba refinery as we did not expect to realize a tax benefit from these losses

general 

operating revenues increased 11 percent or 133 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices for most of the products we produce and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations refined product prices are most significantly influenced by the price of crude oil which is a worldwide commodity whose price is influenced by many factors including but not limited to worldwide supply and demand characteristics worldwide political conditions and worldwide economic conditions however regional factors also impact the price of refined product prices in those geographic regions regional factors can be similar to those that affect the worldwide price of crude oil but they can also be significantly influenced by weather conditions that disrupt the supply of and demand for refined products in the region for example in october 2012 hurricane sandy struck the us east coast and disrupted the supply of 

 41 

refined products in that region for some time which contributed to the increase of 599 per barrel in the north atlantic benchmark reference price of cbob gasoline in 2012 compared to 2011 the higher throughput volumes in 2012 resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 75000 bpd from the meraux refinery which was acquired on october 1 2011 and incremental throughput of 95000 bpd from the pembroke refinery which was acquired on august 1 2011 

operating income increased 330 million and income from continuing operations before income tax expense increased 384 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended december 31 2011 due to a 934 million increase in refining segment operating income a 33 million decrease in retail segment operating income a 443 million decrease in ethanol segment operating income and a 128 million increase in corporate expenses the reasons for these changes are described below 

refining 

refining segment operating income increased from 35 billion for the year ended december 31 2011 to 45 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was impacted by asset impairment losses of 928 million related to the aruba refinery and 65 million related to cancelled capital projects in 2012 41 million of severance expense related to the aruba refinery and a 542 million loss on derivative contracts in 2011 see notes 4 and 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the asset impairment losses and the severance expense respectively excluding these amounts our refining segment operating income increased 14 billion from 41 billion for the year ended december 31 2011 to 55 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 this 14 billion improvement in operating income was primarily due to a 17 billion increase in refining margin partially offset by a 262 million increase in operating expenses 

the 17 billion increase in refining margin a 105 per barrel or 11 percent increase between 2012 and 2011 was primarily the result of improvements in the margin generated in our us midcontinent and north atlantic regions which experienced increases in refining margin of 526 million a 258 per barrel increase and 821 million a 381 per barrel increase respectively 

the 526 million increase in refining margin in the us midcontinent region was largely due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011 for example the us midcontinent benchmark reference margins for cbob gasoline conventional 87 gasoline prior to september 16 2013 and ultralowsulfur diesel a type of distillate increased year over year by 303 per barrel and 390 per barrel respectively and these increases were primarily the result of a 167 per barrel increase in the discount between the price of wti crude oil versus brent crude oil brent crude oil is the type of crude oil used by the market to set the price of refined products but our refineries in the us midcontinent region primarily process wtitype crude oil therefore the increase in the price discount between wti crude oil versus brent crude oil had a positive impact to our refining margin in this region of approximately 300 million wti crude oil priced at a significant discount to brent crude oil during 2012 because of increases in crude oil reserves within the us midcontinent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from canada into that region coupled with the inability to transport significant quantities of that crude oil to refineries in other regions of the country 

the 821 million increase in refining margin in the north atlantic region was also due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011 for example the north atlantic benchmark reference margins for cbob gasoline and ultralowsulfur diesel increased year over year by 471 per barrel and 342 per barrel respectively and these increases were due largely to a reduction in the supply of refined products which resulted from the continued shutdown of refineries in the us east coast caribbean and 

 42 

western europe during 2012 and supply disruptions caused by hurricane sandy which struck the us east coast in october 2012 

the increase of 262 million in operating expenses discussed above was primarily due to an increase of 123 million in operating expenses of the meraux refinery an increase of 214 million in operating expenses incurred by the pembroke refinery and a decrease of 123 million in operating expenses incurred by the aruba refinery we acquired the pembroke refinery on august 1 2011 and the meraux refinery on october 1 2011 therefore operating expenses for 2011 only reflected five months of operating expenses of the pembroke refinery and three months of operating expenses of the meraux refinery in addition in march 2012 we suspended the operations of the aruba refinery which resulted in a significant decrease in operating expenses related to that refinery in 2012 the remaining increase in operating expenses of 48 million was primarily due to an increase of 31 million in employeerelated expenses due to higher compensation expense related to merit increases and promotions and higher expenses for employee benefit costs an increase of 9 million in catalyst and chemical costs due to higher prices of rare earth metals used in our fluid catalytic cracking units an increase of 61 million in ad valorem taxes and insurance expense due to increased insurance reserves in 2012 combined with a nonrecurring favorable ad valorem tax adjustment in 2011 and a decrease of 63 million in energy costs due to lower natural gas prices even though operating expenses increased year over year operating expenses per barrel in 2012 were comparable to 2011 due to the incremental throughput of 179000 bpd which primarily resulted from the incremental throughput of the pembroke and meraux refineries discussed above 

retail 

retail operating income was 348 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 381 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this 9 percent or 33 million decrease was primarily due to a 21 million noncash asset impairment loss related to certain convenience stores see note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements a 56 million decrease in fuel margin from our canadian retail operations and a 41 million increase in fuel margin in our us retail operations 

the canadian retail fuel margin for 2012 was impacted by a decline in fuel volumes sold as a result of fewer retail sites combined with a decline in the fuel margin per gallon which was due to pricing pressure from our competitors and changes in wholesale motor fuel prices during the year our us retail fuel margin improved during 2012 due to increased fuel volumes sold as a result of more retail sites combined with improved fuel margin per gallon as wholesale motor fuel prices peaked in march 2012 and declined throughout the remainder of the year 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating loss was 47 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to operating income of 396 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this decrease of 443 million was primarily due to a 507 million decrease in gross margin partially offset by a 67 million decrease in operating expenses 

the decrease in gross margin was due to a 56 percent decrease in the gross margin per gallon of ethanol production a 038 per gallon decrease between the comparable periods primarily due to lower ethanol prices in 2012 versus 2011 ethanol prices during 2012 were pressured by a surplus of ethanol supply due to reduced demand for ethanol associated with the decline in gasoline demand in the us lower exports of ethanol to europe and increased imports of ethanol from brazil in addition ethanol production decreased 385000 gallons per day between the comparable periods due to lower utilization rates at our ethanol plants during 2012 the reduction in operating expenses was due primarily to a 57 million decrease in energy 

 43 

costs resulting from decreased consumption because of the lower utilization rates previously discussed combined with lower natural gas prices versus the comparable period of 2011 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 127 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 due to 58 million in administrative costs related to our european operations which we acquired on august 1 2011 a 23 million increase in employee benefits expense primarily related to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits and favorable legal settlements of 47 million in 2011 which did not recur in 2012 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 34 million from the year ended december 31 2011 due to an increase of 15 million of foreign currency transaction losses an 11 million reduction in interest income due to the collection of a note receivable from pbf holdings llc in february 2012 and a 7 million reduction in bank interest income due to lower levels of temporary cash investments during 2012 as compared to the prior year 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 88 million from the year ended december 31 2011 this decrease is primarily due to an increase of 69 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and a 33 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings partially offset by a 12 million writeoff of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012 

income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 400 million from the year ended december 31 2011 partially as a result of higher operating income in 2012 the variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily due to not recognizing the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment loss of 928 million and the severance expense of 41 million related to the aruba refinery as we do not expect to realize a tax benefit from these losses

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year  ended december 31 2013  was 56 billion  compared to 53 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2012  changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2013  combined with 735 million  of net cash received in connection with the separation of our retail business consisting of 550 million  of proceeds on shortterm debt a 500 million  cash distribution from cst less 315 million  of cash retained by cst and 525 million  of proceeds on shortterm debt related to the disposition of our retained interest in cst were used mainly to 

 

in addition vlp completed its initial public offering of common units for net proceeds of 369 million  because we consolidate vlp’s financial statements the total cash reported by us also increased by these net proceeds however such proceeds can only be used by vlp for its purposes 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 53 billion compared to 40 billion for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” after excluding the effect of the asset impairment loss included in the 2012 operating income that had no effect on cash changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2012 combined with 300 million of proceeds from the remarketing of the 40 gulf opportunity zone revenue bonds series 2010 go zone bonds 11 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 15 billion of proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable sales facility were used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and 

 45 

interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

for 2014 we expect to incur approximately 23 billion for capital expenditures and approximately 700 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to potential strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  are summarized below in millions 



debt and capital lease obligations 

during 2013 we made scheduled longterm note repayments of 480 million  as described in note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis up to 15 billion as of december 31 2013  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 100 million  all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements 

 46 

would increase as of december 31 2013  all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined product and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2013  there was no significant change in the amount of our short and longterm purchase obligations as compared to december 31 2012  

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2013  

 47 

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2013  our outstanding letters of credit under our committed lines of credit were as follows in millions 



as of december 31 2013  we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities the letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2013  expire during 2014 and 2015 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in offbalance sheet liabilities 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

as of december 31 2013  we have approvals under common stock purchase programs to purchase approximately 26 billion  of our common stock in january 2014 we purchased 4 million shares for 208 million 

pension plan funding 

we plan to contribute approximately 38 million  to our pension plans and 19 million  to our postretirement plans during 2014  

on february 15 2013 we announced changes to certain of our pension plans that reduced our pension obligations in addition we expect that these changes will also reduce our benefit costs for future years as further discussed in note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see notes 10 and 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

during the first quarter of 2014 we expect to pay approximately 400 million in tax payments that relate to 2013 and that were recorded in income taxes payable as of december 31 2013  in addition we currently believe the cash we will pay for income taxes for 2014 will increase and that such amount may exceed the total income tax expense that will be reflected on our statement of income this belief is primarily due to an expected decrease in deductions that we will claim on our us federal income tax return for depreciation 

 48 

on our property plant and equipment in prior years the us federal government enacted certain legislation that provided for the deduction of depreciation on an accelerated basis on newly built equipment as a means of encouraging capital investment by businesses this legislation however generally does not extend beyond 2013 although we expect the amount of cash required to pay our 2014 income taxes to increase compared to recent prior years we believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations and have sufficient cash on hand to make our tax payments as they become due 

as of december 31 2013  the irs has ongoing tax audits related to our us federal tax returns from 2002 through 2011 we have received revenue agent reports in connection with the 2002 through 2009 audits and we are vigorously contesting certain tax positions and assertions from the irs we made significant progress during 2013  in resolving certain of these matters and in january 2014 we settled the audit related to the 2004 and 2005 tax years for a group of our subsidiaries for an amount consistent with the recorded amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with that audit we are continuing to work with the irs to resolve the remaining matters and expect to settle other audits within the next 12 months for amounts consistent with the recorded amounts of unrecognized tax benefits associated with those audits because these settlements are expected to occur in 2014 we classified certain of our longterm uncertain tax position liabilities to current liabilities as of december 31 2013  the total amount of uncertain tax position liabilities was 443 million  as of december 31 2013  with 238 million  reflected in “income taxes payable” and 205 million  reflected in “other longterm liabilities” and this total amount did not change significantly during the year ended december 31 2013  should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

we operate in countries outside the us through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the us in the form of cash dividends should we decide to repatriate such earnings we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated in addition such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations as further discussed in note 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe however that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the us without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings as of december 31 2013  11 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries 

financial regulatory reform 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act wall street reform act key provisions of the wall street reform act create new statutory requirements that require most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses as well as impose new recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities on market participants while certain final rules implementing the wall street reform act became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 others continue to become effective in 2013 and 2014 although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these rules which may result in higher clearing costs and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

concentration of customers 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts 

 49 

receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future the adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

property plant and equipment 

depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group and such evaluations consist of but are not limited to the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained assessment of the need to replace assets and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years 

under the composite method of depreciation the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications design standards and practices accepted in our industry and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives therefore we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group it should be noted however that factors such as competition regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting depreciation expense in the future 

 50 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment intangible assets and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  is included in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates and these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans to determine the expected return on plan assets we utilized a forward 

 51 

looking model of asset returns the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31 2013 was 886 percent the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was 1938 percent 1184 percent and 010 percent respectively these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2013  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2014  in millions 



see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax matters 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to an indirect tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes see notes 12 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of 

 52 

relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 

 53 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil refined products primarily gasoline and distillate grain primarily corn and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including swaps futures and options to hedge 

 

we use the futures markets for the available liquidity which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk in millions 



see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2013  

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs to manage this risk we enter into contracts to purchase 

 54 

these credits when prices are deemed favorable some of these contracts are derivative instruments however we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values as of december 31 2013  there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs 

interest rate risk 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments excluding capital lease obligations dollars in millions the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2013  and 2012  





foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2013  we had commitments to purchase 716 million  of us dollars our market risk was minimal on the contracts as the majority of them matured on or before january 31 2014  resulting in a gain of 12 million  in the first quarter of 2014

overview and outlook 

overview 

for the year ended december 31 2012  we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 21 billion  or 375 per share  assuming dilution which was comparable to the 21 billion  or 369 per share  assuming dilution in net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2011  included in our 2012 results however were noncash asset impairment losses totaling 983 million after taxes or 177 per share assuming dilution primarily related to the impairment of the refining assets of our aruba refinery in connection with our decision in september 2012 to reorganize the refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal this matter is more fully discussed in note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our operating income increased 330 million  from 2011 to 2012 as outlined by business segment in the following table in millions 



operating income for 2012 was also negatively impacted by the noncash asset impairment losses discussed above as well as severance expense of 41 million related to the operations at our aruba refinery and operating income for 2011 was impacted by a 542 million loss on commodity derivative contracts related to forward sales of refined product excluding these significant items total operating income for 2012 and 2011 would have been 51 billion and 42 billion respectively reflecting a 900 million favorable increase between the years and refining segment operating income for 2012 and 2011 would have been 55 billion and 41 billion respectively reflecting a favorable increase of 14 billion between the years 

the 14 billion increase in refining segment operating income was primarily the result of improvements in the margin generated by our us midcontinent and north atlantic refining operations which experienced increases in throughput margin of 258 per barrel and 381 per barrel respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 our us midcontinent region continued to benefit from the favorable difference between the price of brent crude oil and wtitype crude oil which is the type of crude oil primarily processed by our refineries in this region because the market for refined products generally tracks the price of brent crude oil we benefit when the price of wtitype crude oil is lower than the price of brent crude oil the favorable difference between the price of wti and brent crude oil improved by 167 per barrel in 2012 compared to 2011 which contributed significantly to the increase in the throughput margin generated by our operations in this region the results of our north atlantic region were favorably impacted by increases in refined product prices due largely to a reduction in the supply of refined products in this region as compared to the prior year this reduction in supply resulted from the continued shutdown of refineries in the us east coast caribbean and western europe during 2012 which was due to poor refining economics in these areas and supply disruptions caused by hurricane sandy which struck the us east coast in october 2012 

the favorable results of our refining segment were partially offset by the 443 million  decrease in our ethanol segment’s operating income in 2012 compared to 2011 this decrease was due to significantly lower gross 

margins in 2012 caused by a combination of high corn prices and an oversupply of ethanol in the market the increase in corn prices in 2012 was largely due to the severe drought experienced in grain producing regions of the us in 2012 and the oversupply of ethanol inventories was largely attributable to lower exports of ethanol to europe and increased imports of ethanol from brazil 

outlook 

throughout 2011 and 2012 our refining business benefited from processing sweet crude oils sourced from the inland us such as wti crude oil due to the favorable difference between the price of this type of crude oil and the price of a benchmark sweet crude oil such as brent crude oil historically the price of wtitype crude oil has closely approximated brent crude oil but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the us midcontinent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from canada into the us midcontinent region the increased supply of wti crude oil has resulted in wti crude oil being priced at a significant discount to brent crude oil this benefit however may decline as various crude oil pipeline and logistics projects are completed these projects will allow costadvantaged crude oils from the inland us and canada to be transported to the us gulf coast region which is expected to result in a narrowing of the price differential of wtipriced crude oils relative to brentpriced crude oils as a result the margins for refined products for refiners that process wtipriced crude oils may decline 

continued refinery closures in the us east coast caribbean and western europe and additional closures expected to occur in the industry combined with poor reliability and low utilization in latin american refineries create opportunities for competitive refineries to export quality products at higher margins however some marginally profitable refineries may continue to be operated which could negatively impact refined product margins 

thus far in the first quarter of 2013 ethanol margins have improved but the improvement is not significant and the margins remain far below those experienced in 2011 we expect a continued modest improvement in ethanol margins throughout 2013 relative to those in 2012 

energy markets and margins are volatile and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the near to midterm 

we continue to make progress in the separation of our retail business under a new company named cst brands inc the separation is planned by way of a pro rata distribution of 80 percent of the outstanding shares of cst common stock to valero stockholders the distribution is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2013 assuming a favorable private letter ruling from the irs and clearance of all comments from the sec relating to cst’s registration statement on form 10 when the distribution occurs we expect to receive approximately 11 billion of cash and incur a tax liability of approximately 230 million  we also expect to liquidate the remaining 20 percent of cst outstanding shares within 18 months of the distribution details of the separation and distribution are provided in filings with the sec by cst

the asset impairment loss related to the aruba refinery resulted from our decision in march 2012 to suspend refining operations at the refinery and our subsequent decision in september 2012 to reorganize the refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal as discussed in note d we recognized an asset impairment loss of 595 million in march 2012 and an additional asset impairment loss of 308 million in september 2012 resulting in no remaining book value being associated with the refinery’s idled processing units and related infrastructure refining assets in addition we recorded a loss of 25 million related to supplies inventories that supported the refining operations the refining operations will remain suspended indefinitely however we continue to maintain the refining assets to allow them to be restarted and do not consider them to be abandoned no income tax benefits were recorded related to this asset impairment loss 

we also recognized asset impairment losses related to permanently cancelled capital projects at certain of our refineries and related to our determination that the net book values of certain of our retail stores were not recoverable through the future operation and disposition of those stores the aftertax amount of these asset impairment losses was 55 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

the asset impairment losses reflected in the table above are included in the operating income of the respective segment for the year ended december 31 2012 however the asset impairment losses related to the refining segment are excluded from the segment’s operating costs per barrel and from the operating income and operating costs per barrel by region 

 

general 

operating revenues increased 11 percent or 133 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the year ended december 31 2011  primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices for most of the products we produce and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations refined product prices are most significantly influenced by the price of crude oil which is a worldwide commodity whose price is influenced by many factors including but not limited to worldwide supply and demand characteristics worldwide political conditions and worldwide economic conditions however regional factors also impact the price of refined product prices in those geographic regions regional factors can be similar to those that affect the worldwide price of crude oil but they can also be significantly influenced by weather conditions that disrupt the supply of and demand for refined products in the region for example in october 2012 hurricane sandy struck the us east coast and disrupted the supply of refined products in that region for some time which contributed to the increase of 599 per barrel in the north atlantic benchmark reference price of conventional 87 gasoline in 2012 compared to 2011 the higher throughput volumes in 2012 resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 75000 bpd from the meraux refinery which was acquired on october 1 2011 and incremental throughput of 95000 bpd from the pembroke refinery which was acquired on august 1 2011 

operating income increased 330 million  and income from continuing operations before income tax expense increased 384 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the amounts reported for the year ended december 31 2011  due to a 934 million  increase in refining segment operating income a 33 million  decrease in retail segment operating income a 443 million  decrease in ethanol segment operating income and a 128 million  increase in corporate expenses the reasons for these changes are described below 

refining 

refining segment operating income increased from 35 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  to 45 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012  this increase was impacted by asset impairment losses of 928 million  related to the aruba refinery and 65 million  related to cancelled capital projects in 2012 41 million  of severance expense related to the aruba refinery and a 542 million  loss on derivative contracts in 2011 see notes 4 and 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the asset impairment losses and the severance expense respectively excluding these amounts our refining segment operating income increased 14 billion  from 41 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011 to 55 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012  this 14 billion  improvement in operating income was primarily due to a 17 billion increase in refining margin partially offset by a 262 million  increase in operating expenses 

the 17 billion increase in refining margin a 105 per barrel or 11 percent increase between 2012 and 2011 was primarily the result of improvements in the margin generated in our us midcontinent and north atlantic regions which experienced increases in refining margin of 526 million a 258 per barrel increase and 821 million a 381 per barrel increase respectively 

the 526 million increase in refining margin in the us midcontinent region was largely due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011 for example the us midcontinent benchmark reference margins for conventional 87 gasoline and ultralowsulfur diesel a type of distillate increased year over year by 303 per barrel and 390 per barrel respectively and these increases were primarily the result of a 167 per barrel increase in the discount between the price of wti crude oil versus brent crude oil brent crude oil is the type of crude oil used by the market to set the price of refined products but our refineries in the us midcontinent region primarily process wtitype crude oil therefore the increase in the price discount between wti crude oil versus brent crude oil had a positive impact to our refining margin in this region of approximately 300 million wti crude oil priced at a significant discount 

to brent crude oil during 2012 because of increases in crude oil reserves within the us midcontinent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from canada into that region coupled with the inability to transport significant quantities of that crude oil to refineries in other regions of the country as discussed in “overview and outlook” we believe these conditions to remain in the near term however we believe the discount will begin to narrow as crude oil pipeline and logistics projects are completed and other forms of transportation are obtained such as rail cars to enable significant quantities of wtitype crude oil to be transported to other regions 

the 821 million increase in refining margin in the north atlantic region was also due to improved gasoline and distillate margins in that region in 2012 compared to 2011 for example the north atlantic benchmark reference margins for conventional 87 gasoline and ultralowsulfur diesel increased year over year by 522 per barrel and 342 per barrel respectively and these increases were due largely to a reduction in the supply of refined products which resulted from the continued shutdown of refineries in the us east coast caribbean and western europe during 2012 and supply disruptions caused by hurricane sandy which struck the us east coast in october 2012 

the increase of 262 million in operating expenses discussed above was primarily due to an increase of 123 million in operating expenses of the meraux refinery an increase of 214 million in operating expenses incurred by the pembroke refinery and a decrease of 123 million in operating expenses incurred by the aruba refinery we acquired the pembroke refinery on august 1 2011 and the meraux refinery on october 1 2011 therefore operating expenses for 2011 only reflected five months of operating expenses of the pembroke refinery and three months of operating expenses of the meraux refinery in addition in march 2012 we suspended the operations of the aruba refinery which resulted in a significant decrease in operating expenses related to that refinery in 2012 the remaining increase in operating expenses of 48 million was primarily due to an increase of 31 million in employeerelated expenses due to higher compensation expense related to merit increases and promotions and higher expenses for employee benefit costs an increase of 9 million in catalyst and chemical costs due to higher prices of rare earth metals used in our fluid catalytic cracking units an increase of 61 million in ad valorem taxes and insurance expense due to increased insurance reserves in 2012 combined with a nonrecurring favorable ad valorem tax adjustment in 2011 and a decrease of 63 million in energy costs due to lower natural gas prices even though operating expenses increased year over year operating expenses per barrel in 2012 were comparable to 2011 due to the incremental throughput of 179000 bpd which primarily resulted from the incremental throughput of the pembroke and meraux refineries discussed above 

retail 

retail operating income was 348 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 381 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  this 9 percent or 33 million decrease was primarily due to a 21 million  noncash asset impairment loss related to certain convenience stores see note 4  of notes to consolidated financial statements a 56 million decrease in fuel margin from our canadian retail operations and a 41 million increase in fuel margin in our us retail operations 

the canadian retail fuel margin for 2012 was impacted by a decline in fuel volumes sold as a result of fewer retail sites combined with a decline in the fuel margin per gallon which was due to pricing pressure from our competitors and changes in wholesale motor fuel prices during the year our us retail fuel margin improved during 2012 due to increased fuel volumes sold as a result of more retail sites combined with improved fuel margin per gallon as wholesale motor fuel prices peaked in march 2012 and declined throughout the remainder of the year 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating loss was 47 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to operating income of 396 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  this decrease of 443 million  was primarily due to a 507 million decrease in gross margin partially offset by a 67 million  decrease in operating expenses 

the decrease in gross margin was due to a 56 percent decrease in the gross margin per gallon of ethanol production a 038  per gallon decrease between the comparable periods primarily due to lower ethanol prices in 2012 versus 2011 ethanol prices during 2012 were pressured by a surplus of ethanol supply due to reduced demand for ethanol associated with the decline in gasoline demand in the us lower exports of ethanol to europe and increased imports of ethanol from brazil in addition ethanol production decreased 385000 gallons per day between the comparable periods due to lower utilization rates at our ethanol plants during 2012 the reduction in operating expenses was due primarily to a 57 million decrease in energy costs resulting from decreased consumption because of the lower utilization rates previously discussed combined with lower natural gas prices versus the comparable period of 2011  

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 127 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the year ended december 31 2011  due to 58 million in administrative costs related to our european operations which we acquired on august 1 2011 a 23 million increase in employee benefits expense primarily related to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits and favorable legal settlements of 47 million in 2011 which did not recur in 2012 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 34 million  from the year ended december 31 2011  due to an increase of 15 million of foreign currency transaction losses an 11 million reduction in interest income due to the collection of a note receivable from pbf holdings llc in february 2012 and a 7 million reduction in bank interest income due to lower levels of temporary cash investments during 2012 as compared to the prior year 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for the year ended december 31 2012  decreased 88 million  from the year ended december 31 2011  this decrease is primarily due to an increase of 69 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and a 33 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings partially offset by a 12 million writeoff of unamortized debt discounts related to the early redemption of certain industrial revenue bonds in the first quarter of 2012 

income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 400 million  from the year ended december 31 2011  partially as a result of higher operating income in 2012  the variation in the customary relationship between income tax expense and income from continuing operations before income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2012  was primarily due to not recognizing the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment loss of 928 million  and the severance expense of 41 million  related to the aruba refinery as we do not expect to realize a tax benefit from these losses

general 

operating revenues increased 53 percent or 438 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the year ended december 31 2010  primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations the higher throughput volumes resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 33000 bpd 1   13 billion  of revenue from the meraux refinery which was acquired on october 1 2011 incremental throughput of 109000 bpd 1   75 billion  of revenue from the pembroke refinery which was acquired on august 1 2011 and incremental throughput of 145000 bpd 49 billion of revenue from the aruba refinery which restarted operations in january 2011 operating income increased 18 billion  and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased 18 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the amounts reported for the year ended december 31 2010  primarily due to a 16 billion  increase in refining segment operating income discussed below 

 

1 calculated based on throughput volumes of the meraux refinery and the pembroke refinery from the date of their respective acquisitions october 1 2011 and august 1 2011 divided by the number of days during the year ended december 31 2011 

refining 

refining segment operating income nearly doubled from 19 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  to 35 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  the 16 billion  improvement in operating income was due to a 22 billion increase in refining margin partially offset by a 462 million  increase in operating expenses 

the 22 billion increase in refining margin was primarily due to a 27 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel a 211 per barrel increase between the years this increase in refining margin was largely driven by an improvement in the us midcontinent region which experienced an increase in its throughput margin per barrel of 858  the us midcontinent throughput margin per barrel of 1591  for the year ended december 31 2011  was more than double the throughput margin per barrel of 733  for the year ended december 31 2010  this increase was due to the substantial discount in the price of wtitype crude oil the primary type of crude oil processed by our us midcontinent refineries versus the price of lls and brent crude oils historically the price of wtitype crude oil has closely approximated lls and brent crude oils but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the us midcontinent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from canada into the us midcontinent region the increased supply of wtitype crude oil resulted in wtitype crude oil being priced at a significant discount to lls and brent crude oils during 2011 for example the wtibased benchmark reference margin for us midcontinent conventional 87 gasoline was 2237 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 820 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  representing a favorable increase of 1417 per barrel in addition the wtibased benchmark reference margin for us midcontinent ultralow sulfur diesel a type of distillate was 3106 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 1191 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  representing a favorable increase of 1915 per barrel we estimate that these increases in gasoline and distillate margins per barrel had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately 11 billion and 10 billion respectively year over year 

the increase of 462 million in operating expenses discussed above was partially due to 42 million in operating expenses of the meraux refinery which was acquired on october 1 2011 and 141 million in operating expenses of the pembroke refinery which was acquired on august 1 2011 the remaining increase of 279 million was due to a 107 million increase in chemicals and catalyst costs due to higher prices of rare earth metals used in our fluid catalytic cracking units an 86 million increase in employeerelated expenses due to higher incentive compensation and a 75 million increase in reliability expenses due to the restart of the aruba refinery and higher routine maintenance during refinery downtime 

retail 

retail operating income was 381 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 346 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  this 10 percent or 35 million increase was primarily due to increases in fuel margins of 43 million primarily from our canadian operations including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and an increase in merchandise margins of 15 million offset by increased operating expenses of 24 million  the increase in operating expenses was primarily from our canadian operations which were impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on average cdn1 was equal to 101 during 2011 compared to 096 during 2010 representing an increase in value of five percent 

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 396 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 209 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  this increase of 187 million  was primarily due to a 226 million increase in gross margin partially offset by a 36 million increase in operating expenses 

gross margin increased from the year ended december 31 2010  to the year ended december 31 2011  due to an increase in ethanol production a 331000 gallon per day increase between the years primarily resulting from the full operation of three additional plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 and higher utilization rates and increased yields during 2011 combined with a 013 per gallon increase in the ethanol gross margin 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to 27 million of additional expenses related to the three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 we operated these plants for all of 2011 compared to part of 2010 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 40 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the year ended december 31 2010  due to a 25 million increase in variable compensation expense 27 million  in costs incurred in connection with the pembroke acquisition and a favorable settlement with an insurance company for 40 million recorded in 2010 which reduced general and administrative expenses in 2010 these increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by favorable legal settlements of 47 million in 2011 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased 63 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  due to a pretax gain of 55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in cameron highway oil pipeline company chops recognized in november 2010 and the 16 million effect of earnings on our interest in chops recognized in 2010 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for the year ended december 31 2011  decreased 83 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  this decrease is primarily due to an increase of 62 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and the resumption of construction activity on previously suspended projects combined with a 19 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings 

income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2011  increased 651 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2011 and a onetime 20 million income tax benefit recognized in 2010 related to a tax settlement with the government of aruba goa 

the loss from discontinued operations of 7 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  is primarily due to adjustments to the working capital settlement related to the sale of our paulsboro refinery in december 2010 the loss from discontinued operations of 599 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  represents a 47 million aftertax loss from the discontinued operations of the delaware city and paulsboro refineries and a 610 million aftertax loss on the sale of the paulsboro refinery partially offset by a 58 million aftertax gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets at delaware city 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 53 billion  compared to 40 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” after excluding the effect of the asset impairment loss included in the 2012 operating income that had no effect on cash changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2012  combined with 300 million  of proceeds from the remarketing of the 40 gulf opportunity zone revenue bonds series 2010 go zone bonds 11 billion  of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 15 billion  of proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable sales facility were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 40 billion  compared to 30 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the 18 billion increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 are shown in note 19  of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2011 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline distillate and crude oil at the end of 2011 compared to such prices at the end of 2010 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2011 combined with 150 million  of proceeds from the sale of receivables and 23 billion  from available cash on hand was used mainly to 

 

capital investments 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units 

are improved continuously the cost of improvements which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units can be significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process higher volumes of sour crude oil which lowers our feedstock costs and enables us to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly 

during the year ended december 31 2012  we expended 29 billion  for capital expenditures and 479 million  for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2012  included 135 million  of costs related to environmental projects 

for 2013 we expect to incur approximately 19 billion for capital expenditures approximately 100 million  of which is for environmental projects and approximately 600 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012  are summarized below in millions 



debt and capital lease obligations 

during 2012 the following debt activity occurred 

 

 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis in july 2012 we amended our agreement to increase the facility from 10 billion to 15 billion  and extended the maturity date to july 2013 during the year ended december 31 2012  we sold 15 billion  of interests in eligible receivables to the thirdparty entities and financial institutions under this facility and we repaid 17 billion  under this facility as of december 31 2012  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 100 million  all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt 

our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by sp moody’s and fitch the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase as of december 31 2012  all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined product and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed 

or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2012  our short and longterm purchase obligations decreased by approximately 3 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2011  the decrease is primarily attributable to contracts expiring in 2013 

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2012  

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2012  our committed lines of credit were as follows in millions 



as of december 31 2012  we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities the letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2012  expire during 2013 and 2014 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

as of december 31 2012  we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately 33 billion  of our common stock 

pension plan funding 

we have 30 million  of minimum required contributions to one of our international pension plans during 2013  in addition we plan to contribute approximately 115 million  to our other pension plans and 21 million  to our other postretirement plans during 2013  

on february 15 2013 we announced changes to certain of our pension plans that will reduce our benefit costs and obligations for 2013 and future years as further discussed in note 14  of notes to consolidated financial statements these changes however will not impact our planned contributions during 2013 but we expect future contributions to decline 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes indirect taxes exciseduty salesuse gross receipts and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties see notes 12 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax matters 

as of december 31 2012  the internal revenue service irs has ongoing tax audits related to our us federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009 as discussed in note 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements we have received revenue agent reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the irs although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements should the irs eventually prevail it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

we operate in countries outside the us through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the us in the form of cash dividends should we decide to repatriate such earnings we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated in addition such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations as further discussed in note 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe however that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the us without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings as of december 31 2012  11 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries 

financial regulatory reform 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act wall street reform act key provisions of the wall street reform act create new statutory requirements that require most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses as well as impose new recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities on market participants while certain final rules implementing the wall street reform act became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012 others will not become effective until 2013 therefore the ultimate impact to our operations is yet unknown however the implementation could result in higher clearing costs and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities 

concentration of customers 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

property plant and equipment 

the cost of property plant and equipment property assets purchased or constructed including betterments of property assets are capitalized however the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets is expensed as incurred betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset or improve the safety of our operations the cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are improved continuously improvements consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group and such evaluations consist of but are not limited to the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained assessment of the need to replace assets and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years 

under the composite method of depreciation the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications design standards and practices accepted in our industry and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives therefore we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group it should be noted however that factors such as competition regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting depreciation expense in the future 

also under the composite method of depreciation the historical cost of a minor property asset net of salvage value that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income however a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset primarily involuntary conversions gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment intangible assets and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses 

we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our 

own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  is included in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2012  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2013 in millions 



see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as discussed in note 14  we announced changes to certain of our pension plans on february 15 2013 that will reduce our benefit costs and obligations for 2013 and future years 

tax matters 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to an indirect tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes see notes 12 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil refined products primarily gasoline and distillate grain primarily corn and natural gas used in our operations to reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows we use commodity derivative instruments including swaps futures and options to hedge 

 

we use the futures markets for the available liquidity which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations we use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows 

our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk in millions 



see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2012  

compliance program price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of financial instruments associated with 

various governmental and regulatory compliance programs that we must purchase in the open market to comply with these programs to reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows we may enter into derivative instruments such as futures as of december 31 2012 there was no gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the futures contracts see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion about these compliance programs and notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of december 31 2012  

interest rate risk

 item 7 management ’ s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with items 1 1a and 2 “business risk factors and properties” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” included in this report in the discussions that follow pershare amounts include the effect of common equivalent shares for periods reflecting income from continuing operations and exclude the effect of common equivalent shares for periods reflecting a loss from continuing operations 

cautionary statement for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “overview and outlook” includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 you can identify our forwardlooking statements by the words “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “estimate” “project” “projection” “predict” “budget” “forecast” “goal” “guidance” “target” “could” “should” “may” and similar expressions 

these forwardlooking statements include among other things statements regarding 

 

we based our forwardlooking statements on our current expectations estimates and projections about ourselves and our industry we caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict in addition we based many of these forwardlooking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forwardlooking statements differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forwardlooking statements could result from a variety of factors including the following 

 

 

any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forwardlooking statements ultimately prove to be accurate our forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forwardlooking statements we do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so 

all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forwardlooking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

overview and outlook 

we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of 21 billion  or 369 per share  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 923 million  or 162 per share  for the year ended december 31 2010  the improvement in net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to an increase in operating income of 18 billion  attributable to the business segments outlined in the following table in millions 



the increase of 16 billion  in refining operating income was primarily due to the favorable difference between the price of sweet crude oils sourced from the inland us such as west texas intermediate wti versus the price of benchmark sweet crude oils such as lls and brent historically the price of wtitype crude oil has closely approximated lls and brent crude oils due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the us midcontinent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from canada into the us midcontinent region the increased supply of wtitype crude oil resulted in wtitype crude oil being priced at a significant discount to lls and brent crude oils for most of 2011 as compared to 2010 our mckee and ardmore refineries in the us midcontinent region process wtitype crude oils and significantly benefited from this favorable price difference 

the increase of 35 million  in retail operating income was primarily due to higher fuel margins and volumes in our canadian operations including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 

the increase of 187 million  in ethanol operating income was primarily due to improved operating margins combined with an increase in production volumes to an average of 34 million gallons per day the ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and is impacted by us government subsidies and biofuels including ethanol mandates 

on august 1 2011  we acquired 100 percent  of the outstanding shares of chevron limited from a subsidiary of chevron corporation and we subsequently changed the name of chevron limited to valero energy ltd valero energy ltd owns and operates the pembroke refinery valero energy ltd also owns directly and through various subsidiaries an extensive network of marketing and logistics assets throughout the uk and ireland on the acquisition date we initially paid 18 billion  from available cash of which 11 billion  was for working capital subsequent to the acquisition date we recorded an adjustment to working capital primarily inventory resulting in an adjusted purchase price of 17 billion  this acquisition is referred to as the pembroke acquisition 

on october 1 2011  we acquired the meraux refinery and related logistics assets from murphy oil corporation for an initial payment of 586 million  which was funded from available cash in the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded an adjustment related to inventories acquired that reduced the purchase price to 547 million  

the benefit we experienced in our refining business for most of 2011 from processing discounted wtitype crude oils declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 as the premium of lls and brent crude oils versus wtitype crude oil narrowed considerably in addition our fourth quarter 2011 results reflected a significant decline in margins for most of the products we produce product margins have since improved in early 2012 but we expect the energy markets and margins to be volatile the us and worldwide refining business continues to experience capacity rationalization particularly in europe the us east coast and the caribbean where declining product margins have negatively impacted refineries in those regions in particular our aruba refinery has been negatively impacted we restarted the aruba refinery in january 2011 after shutting it down temporarily in july 2009 but the refinery has not yet generated positive cash flows on a sustained basis we are exploring strategic alternatives for the refinery including alternative feedstocks configuration changes and a temporary or permanent shutdown of the refinery facilities we expect to conclude our evaluation of these strategic alternatives in the first quarter of 2012 a decision to temporarily or permanently shut down the refinery or a revision to the future operating plans for the refinery that results in a decrease in future expected cash flows could result in the refinery being impaired the aruba refinery had a net book value of 958 million  as of december 31 2011  therefore an impairment loss would be material to our results of operations 

as of the date of the filing of this report the financial markets continue to experience significant volatility and the overall impact on our business is uncertain at this time

general 

operating revenues increased 53 percent or 438 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the year ended december 31 2010  primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations the higher throughput volumes resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 33000 bpd 1   13 billion  of revenue from the meraux refinery which was acquired on october 1 2011  incremental throughput of 109000 bpd 1   75 billion  of revenue from the pembroke refinery which was acquired on august 1 2011  and incremental throughput of 145000 bpd 49 billion of revenue from the aruba refinery which restarted operations in january 2011 operating income increased 18 billion  and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased 18 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the amounts reported for the year ended december 31 2010  primarily due to a 16 billion  increase in refining segment operating income discussed below 

 

1 calculated based on throughput volumes of the meraux refinery and the pembroke refinery from the date of their respective acquisitions october 1 2011 and august 1 2011 divided by the number of days during the year ended december 31 2011 

refining 

refining segment operating income nearly doubled from 19 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  to 35 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011  the 16 billion  improvement in operating income was due to a 22 billion increase in refining margin partially offset by a 462 million  increase in operating expenses 

the 22 billion increase in refining margin was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel a 150 per barrel increase between the years this increase in refining margin was largely driven by an improvement in the us midcontinent region which experienced an increase in its throughput margin per barrel of 777  the us midcontinent throughput margin per barrel of 1510  for the year ended december 31 2011  was more than double the throughput margin per barrel of 733  for the year ended december 31 2010  this increase was due to the substantial discount in the price of wtitype crude oil the primary type of crude oil processed by our us midcontinent refineries versus the price of lls and brent crude oils historically the price of wtitype crude oil has closely approximated lls and brent crude oils but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the us midcontinent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from canada into the us midcontinent region the increased supply of wtitype crude oil resulted in wtitype crude oil being priced at a significant discount to lls and brent crude oils during 2011 for example the wtibased benchmark reference margin for us midcontinent conventional 87 gasoline was 2237 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 820 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  representing a favorable increase of 1417 per barrel in addition the wtibased benchmark reference margin for us midcontinent ultralow sulfur diesel a type of distillate was 3106 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 1191 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  representing a favorable increase of 1915 per barrel we estimate that these increases in gasoline and distillate margins per barrel had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately 11 billion and 10 billion respectively year over year 

the increase of 462 million in operating expenses discussed above was partially due to 42 million in operating expenses of the meraux refinery which was acquired on october 1 2011 and 141 million in operating expenses of the pembroke refinery which was acquired on august 1 2011 the remaining increase of 279 million was due to a 107 million increase in chemicals and catalyst costs an 86 million increase in employeerelated expenses and a 75 million increase in reliability expenses 

retail 

retail operating income was 381 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 346 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  this 10 percent or 35 million increase was primarily due to increases in fuel margins of 43 million primarily from our canadian operations including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and an increase in merchandise margins of 15 million offset by increased operating expenses of 24 million  

ethanol 

ethanol segment operating income was 396 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to 209 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  this increase of 187 million  was primarily due to a 226 million increase in gross margin partially offset by a 36 million increase in operating expenses 

gross margin increased from the year ended december 31 2010  to the year ended december 31 2011  due to an increase in ethanol production a 331000 gallon per day increase between the years primarily resulting from the full operation of three additional plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 and higher utilization rates and increased yields during 2011 combined with a 013 per gallon increase in the ethanol gross margin 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to 27 million of additional expenses related to the three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 we operated these plants for all of 2011 compared to part of 2010 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 40 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the year ended december 31 2010  due to a 25 million increase in variable compensation expense 27 million  in costs incurred in connection with the pembroke acquisition and a favorable settlement with an insurance company for 40 million recorded in 2010 which reduced general and administrative expenses in 2010 these increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by favorable legal settlements of 47 million in 2011 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased 63 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  due to a pretax gain of 55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in cameron highway oil pipeline company chops recognized in november 2010 and the 16 million effect of earnings on our interest in chops recognized in 2010 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” for the year ended december 31 2011  decreased 83 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  this decrease is primarily due to an increase of 62 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and the resumption of construction activity on previously suspended projects combined with a 19 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings 

income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 651 million  from the year ended december 31 2010  mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2011  and a onetime 20 million income tax benefit recognized in 2010 related to a tax settlement with the government of aruba goa 

the loss from discontinued operations of 7 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  is primarily due to adjustments to the working capital settlement related to the sale of our paulsboro refinery in december 2010 the loss from discontinued operations of 599 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  represents a 47 million aftertax loss from the discontinued operations of the delaware city and paulsboro refineries and a 610 million aftertax loss on the sale of the paulsboro refinery partially offset by a 58 million aftertax gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets at delaware city

general 

operating revenues increased 27 percent or 176 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the year ended december 31 2009  primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years operating income increased 18 billion  and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased 18 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the amounts reported for the year ended december 31 2009  primarily due to a 17 billion  increase in refining segment operating income discussed below 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment increased from 247 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  to 19 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of 13 billion  discussed below reduced asset impairment loss of 218 million  and the nonrecurrence of a 114 million  loss contingency accrual in 2009 the asset impairment loss recorded in 2009  related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008 we continued to evaluate our ongoing construction projects during 2009 and 2010 but the number and significance of projects cancelled substantially declined in 2010 the loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in aruba 

the 13 billion  improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel an overall 180 per barrel increase between the comparable years the increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical primarily propylene margins but these improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials the impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below 

 

 

retail 

retail operating income was 346 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to 293 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  this 18 percent or 53 million increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of 57 million and merchandise margin of 27 million partially offset by a 28 million increase in operating expenses 

retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment for most of 2010 ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins for example the chicago board of trade cbot price for a gallon of ethanol was 023 less than a gallon of us gulf coast conventional 87 gasoline for the year ended december 31 2010  but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended december 31 2009  we estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a 32 million positive impact to our us retail fuel margins for 2010  as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended december 31 2010  contained 10 percent ethanol retail fuel margins in our canadian retail operations increased by 27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2010 compared to 2009 on average cdn1 was equal to 096 during 2010 compared to 088 in 2009 representing an increase in value of nine percent 

retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix and a favorable impact from the stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2010 compared to 2009 as described above 

the increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2010 compared to 2009 the stronger canadian dollar had a 21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our canadian retail operations compared to 2009 

ethanol 

ethanol operating income was 209 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to 165 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  this increase of 44 million  was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 as described in note 2  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses decreased 41 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the year ended december 31 2009  primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for 40 million recorded in 2010 which offset an increase in litigation costs of 40 million recorded in 2009 after adjusting for these items the 40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of 21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of 18 million for environmental remediation expenses 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2010  increased 89 million  from the year ended december 31 2009  due to a pretax gain of 55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in chops in november 2010 and the effect of a 42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earnout agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our krotz springs refinery in 2008 

“interest and debt expense net of capitalized interest” increased 68 million  from the year ended december 31 2009  to the year ended december 31 2010  this increase is composed of a 53 million increase 

in interest incurred on 125 billion of debt issued in february 2010 and 10 billion of debt issued in march 2009 see note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements and a 15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects we do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume 

income tax expense increased 618 million  from a 43 million  benefit in 2009  to 575 million  of expense in 2010  mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010  

“loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” decreased 11 billion  from the year ended december 31 2009  to the year ended december 31 2010  due to the aftertax loss of 12 billion related to the permanent shut down of our delaware city refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009 the results of operations for the paulsboro and delaware city refineries including the loss and gain respectively on their sales are reflected in “loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” as discussed in note 3  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011  was 40 billion  compared to 30 billion  for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the 18 billion increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2011  due to significant increases in prices for gasoline distillate and crude oil at the end of 2011  compared to such prices at the end of 2010  

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2011  combined with 150 million  of proceeds from the sale of receivables and 23 billion  from available cash on hand was used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010  was 30 billion  compared to 18 billion  for the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a 923 million tax refund in 2010   changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2010  and 2009  are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2010  due to significant increases in prices for gasoline distillate and crude oil at the end of 2010  compared to such prices at the end of 2009  

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2010  combined with 15 billion of proceeds from the issuance of 400 million of 45 notes due in february 2015 850 million of 6125 notes due in february 2020 and 300 million of go zone bonds as discussed in note 11  of notes to consolidated financial statements 547 million of proceeds from the sale of the paulsboro refinery 220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown delaware city refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets and 330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in chops as discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

 

cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the paulsboro and delaware city refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 and are summarized as follows in millions 



capital investments 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are continuously improved improvements consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units and the cost of these improvements is significant we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value as such the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce or to enhance their profitability reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process higher volumes of sour crude oil which lowers our feedstock costs and enables us to refine crude oil into products with higher market values therefore many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity 

significantly 

during the year ended december 31 2011  we expended 24 billion  for capital expenditures and 629 million  for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2011  included 241 million  of costs related to environmental projects 

for 2012 we expect to incur approximately 34 billion for capital investments including approximately 28 billion for capital expenditures approximately 140 million  of which is for environmental projects and approximately 560 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011  are summarized below in millions 



debt and capital lease obligations 

during 2011 the following activity occurred related to our nonbank debt 

 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 1 billion  of eligible trade receivables we amended our agreement in june 2011 to extend the maturity date to june 2012 as of december 31 2011  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 250 million  during the year ended december 31 2011  we sold 150 million  of eligible receivables under this program and made no repayments all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt 

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by sp moody’s and fitch the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase as of december 31 2011  all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 



we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks refined products and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2011  our short and longterm purchase obligations increased by approximately 6 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2010  the increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at december 31 2011  compared to december 31 2010  

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2011  

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2011  our committed lines of credit were as follows in millions 



as of december 31 2011  we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities the letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2011  expire during 2012 and 2013 

other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources 

stock purchase programs 

as of december 31 2011  we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately 35 billion  of our common stock 

pension plan funded status 

during 2011  we contributed 204 million to our pension plans that have minimum funding requirements as of december 31 2011 the fair value of the assets of these plans was approximately 88 percent of the projected benefit obligations under these plans 

we have minimum required contributions of 2 million  to these pension plans during 2012 however we plan to contribute approximately 100 million  to our pension plans during 2012 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations see note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters 

tax matters 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes transactional taxes exciseduty salesuse and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties see notes 12 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax matters 

as of december 31 2011 the internal revenue service irs has ongoing tax audits related to our us federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009 as discussed in note 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements we have received revenue agent reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the irs although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements should the irs eventually prevail it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

cash held by our international subsidiaries 

we operate in countries outside the us through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the us in the form of cash dividends should we decide to repatriate such earnings we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated in addition such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations as further discussed in note 16  of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe however that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the us without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings as of december 31 2011  822 million of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries 

financial regulatory reform 

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act wall street reform act the wall street reform act among many things creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses rules to implement the wall street reform act are being finalized and therefore the impact to our operations is not yet known however implementation could result in higher margin requirements higher clearing costs and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities 

concentration of customers 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

sources of liquidity 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

property plant and equipment 

the cost of property plant and equipment property assets purchased or constructed including betterments of property assets are capitalized the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets however is expensed as incurred betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset or improve the safety of our operations the cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities 

our operations especially those of our refining segment are highly capital intensive each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets consisting of a series of interconnected highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure units and these units are continuously improved improvements consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units we plan for these improvements by developing a multiyear capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors 

depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group and such evaluations consist of but are not limited to the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained assessment of the need to replace assets and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years 

under the composite method of depreciation the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group’s estimated useful life we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications design standards and practices accepted in our industry and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives therefore we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group it should be noted however that factors such as competition regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates thus impacting depreciation expense in the future 

also under the composite method of depreciation the historical cost of a minor property asset net of salvage value that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income however a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset primarily involuntary conversions gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment intangible assets and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses 

we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in note 12  of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  is included in note 10  of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that have an average rating of doublea when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2011  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2012 in millions 



see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax matters 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes transactional taxes exciseduty salesuse and valueadded taxes payroll taxes franchise taxes withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time in addition we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our 

estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes see notes 12 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

overview and outlook 

  

we reported income from continuing operations of 923 million  or 162 per share for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to a loss from continuing operations of 273 million  or 050 per share for the year ended december 31 2009  these results were primarily due to our refining segment operations which generated operating income of 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to operating income of 247 million for the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in refining operating income was primarily due to improved margins for the distillate products we produce and wider sour crude oil differentials the sour crude oil differential is the difference between the price of sweet crude oil and the price of sour crude oil we believe that the improved distillate margins are due to an increase in the demand for refined products resulting from the improving us and worldwide economies although improving refined product demand has not returned to levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown that began in 2008 excess worldwide refinery capacity and high levels of refined product inventories continue to constrain refined product margins 

  

in response to the worldwide economic slowdown and as a result of our assessment of the operating performance and profitability of our refineries we temporarily shut down our aruba refinery in july 2009 and permanently shut down our delaware city refinery in november 2009 in june 2010 we sold our shutdown delaware city refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets for 220 million of cash proceeds and in december 2010 we sold our paulsboro refinery and associated inventory for 547 million of cash proceeds and a 160 million oneyear note our aruba refinery remained idle throughout 2010 but in the third quarter of 2010 we began refinerywide maintenance to prepare the refinery’s production units for restart due to improved sour crude oil differentials and a general improvement in refining economics the aruba refinery resumed operations in january 2011 

  

our retail segment generated operating income of 346 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to operating income of 293 million for the year ended december 31 2009  the 2010 results benefited from the blending of ethanol into gasoline sold by our retail segment for most of 2010 ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost results in an increase in retail fuel margins during the latter part of 2010 the difference between the cost of gasoline and the cost of ethanol began to narrow and the benefit that our retail segment experienced through most of 2010 from the blending of ethanol into gasoline narrowed should this trend continue in 2011 our retail fuel margins may be negatively impacted as compared to 2010 

  

in the second quarter of 2009 we entered the ethanol business through the acquisition of seven ethanol facilities and we acquired three additional facilities in the first quarter of 2010 we believe that ethanol is a natural fit for us because we manufacture transportation fuels during the year ended december 31 2010  our ethanol segment generated operating income of 209 million  compared to 165 million for the year ended december 31 2009  the ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and can be impacted by us government subsidies and biofuels including ethanol mandates 

  

to support our financial strength and liquidity we issued 125 billion in debt during the first quarter of 2010 at interest rates favorable to those on our existing debt we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem 484 million of debt with a higher interest rate and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes in december 2010 we received proceeds of 300 million under a financing agreement associated with the issuance of 300 million of gulf opportunity zone revenue bonds go zone bonds in february 2011 we paid 300 million to acquire the go zone bonds which we expect to hold and reissue in future years to help fund the construction costs of a capital project at our st charles refinery 

  

  

  

we expect the us and worldwide economies to continue to recover slowly and we expect refined product demand to increase the increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils and continued improvement in sour crude oil differentials the expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil production should favorably impact our refined product margins however we expect that the current excess global refining capacity will put pressure on refining margins and could result in ongoing production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry we will continue to optimize our refining assets based on market conditions

have been restated to reflect this reclassification 

   

general 

operating revenues increased 27 percent or 176 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years operating income increased 18 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to the amounts reported for the year ended december 31 2009  primarily due to a 17 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below 

  

refining 

operating income for our refining segment increased from 247 million for the year ended december 31 2009 to 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2010  primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of 13 billion discussed below reduced asset impairment losses of 218 million  and the nonrecurrence of a 114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009 the asset impairment loss recorded in 2009 related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008 we continue to evaluate our ongoing construction projects but the number and significance of projects cancelled has substantially declined in 2010 the loss contingency accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in aruba 

  

the 13 billion improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel an overall 180 per barrel increase between the comparable years the increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical primarily propylene margins but those improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials the impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below 

  

changes in the margin that we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations for example the benchmark reference margin for us gulf coast ultralowsulfur diesel which is a type of distillate was 1114 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to 802 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2009  representing a favorable increase of 312 per barrel similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions we estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an 820 million positive impact to our overall refining margin year over year as we produced 712000 barrels per day of distillates during the year ended december 31 2010  similarly the benchmark reference margin for us gulf coast propylene was 792 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to a negative margin of 131 for the year ended december 31 2009  representing a favorable increase of 923 per barrel we estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals primarily propylene had a 199 million positive impact on our refining margin year over year distillate and propylene margins 

  

  

were higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the us and worldwide economies and exports 

  

the benchmark reference margin for us gulf coast conventional 87 gasoline gulf coast 87 gasoline was 751 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to 761 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2009  representing an unfavorable decrease of 010 per barrel carbob 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the west coast region a 187 per barrel unfavorable decrease we estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a 119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin year over year as we produced 105 million barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended december 31 2010 gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010 we believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory in addition our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline 

  

for the year ended december 31 2010  the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended december 31 2009  for example maya crude oil which is a type of sour crude oil sold at a discount of 913 per barrel to wti crude oil a type of sweet crude oil during the year ended december 31 2010  this compares to a discount of 519 per barrel during the year ended december 31 2009  representing a favorable increase of 394 per barrel the benefit of this wider differential however was offset by a reduction of 30000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009 we estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process offset by reduced throughput volumes had a 196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed 844000 barrels per day of sour crude oils 

  

retail 

retail operating income was 346 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 293 million for the year ended december 31 2009  this 18 percent or 53 million  increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of 57 million and merchandise margins of 27 million partially offset by a 28 million increase in operating expenses 

  

retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment for most of 2010 ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins for example the chicago board of trade cbot price for a gallon of ethanol was 023 less than a gallon of gulf coast 87 gasoline for the year ended december 31 2010  but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended december 31 2009  we estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a 32 million positive impact to our us retail fuel margins for 2010 as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended december 31 2010 contained 10 percent ethanol retail fuel margins in our canadian retail operations increased by 27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2010 compared to 2009 on average cdn1 was equal to 096 during 2010 compared to 088 in 2009 representing an increase in value of nine percent 

  

retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix and a favorable impact from the stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2010 compared to 2009 as described above 

  

  

  

the increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2010 compared to 2009 the stronger canadian dollar had a 21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our canadian retail operations compared to 2009 

ethanol 

ethanol operating income was 209 million for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to 165 million for the year ended december 31 2009  this increase of 44 million was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 as described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses decreased 41 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for 40 million recorded in 2010 which offset an increase in litigation costs of 40 million recorded in 2009 after adjusting for these items the 40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of 21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of 18 million for environmental remediation expenses 

  

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 89 million from the year ended december 31 2009 due to a pretax gain of 55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in cameron highway oil pipeline company chops in november 2010 and the effect of a 42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earnout agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our krotz springs refinery in 2008 

  

interest and debt expense increased 68 million from the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2010  this increase is composed of a 53 million increase in interest incurred on 125 billion of debt issued in february 2010 and 10 billion of debt issued in march 2009 see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements and a 15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects we do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume we anticipate that significant construction activities will resume on certain construction projects in 2011 

  

income tax expense increased 618 million from a 43 million benefit in 2009 to 575 million of expense in 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010 

  

“loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” decreased 11 billion from the year ended december 31 2009 to the year ended december 31 2010 due to the aftertax loss of 12 billion related to the permanent shutdown of the delaware city refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009 the results of operations for the paulsboro and delaware city refineries including the loss and gain respectively on their sales are reflected in “loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” as discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements

general 

operating revenues decreased 39 percent or 421 billion  for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008  operating income decreased by 448 million and income from continuing operations before taxes decreased by 600 million over the same period these decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the us and worldwide economic slowdown on the demand and prices for our refined products the economic slowdown began in late 2008 and persisted throughout 2009 the decreases in operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes however were significantly affected by the 40 billion goodwill impairment loss and the 305 million gain on the sale of our krotz springs refinery that we recorded in 2008 excluding these two items operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased by 42 billion and 43 billion respectively from the prior year these decreases were primarily related to our refining segment which experienced a 518 million decrease in operating income in 2009 compared to 2008 a 43 billion decrease after excluding the effect of the goodwill writeoff and other items as discussed below 

  

refining 

operating income for our refining segment decreased from 765 million for the year ended december 31 2008 to 247 million for the year ended december 31 2009  due to a decrease in operating results of 43 billion discussed below a reduced goodwill impairment loss of 40 billion  an increased asset impairment loss of 134 million  and an increased loss contingency accrual of 114 million  the goodwill impairment loss related to our determination in 2008 that our goodwill was impaired which was based on the significant decline in our equity market capitalization that decline was caused by severe disruptions in the us and worldwide capital and commodities markets in 2008 and the resulting economic slowdown the asset impairment loss of 220 million and 86 million reported in 2009 and 2008  respectively related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008 the loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in aruba 

  

the 43 billion decrease in operating results was primarily due to a 46 percent decrease in throughput margin per barrel a 516 per barrel decrease between the comparable years and an 8 percent decrease in throughput volumes an 186000 barrel per day decrease between the comparable years the decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the economic slowdown on the demand for and prices of refined products the decrease in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant decrease in distillate margins but 

  

  

the decrease in distillate margins was somewhat offset by an increase in gasoline margins in all of our refining regions throughput margin per barrel was also negatively impacted by narrow sour crude oil differentials the impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below 

  

changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations for example the benchmark reference margin for us gulf coast ultralowsulfur diesel was 802 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2009  compared to 2296 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2008  representing an unfavorable decrease of 1494 per barrel we experienced similar decreases in distillate margins in other regions we estimate that the decrease in distillate margins negatively impacted our overall refining margin by 44 billion as we produced 692000 barrels per day of distillates during the year ended december 31 2009  

  

the benchmark reference margin for gulf coast 87 gasoline was 761 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 485 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2008 representing a favorable increase of 276 per barrel carbob 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins increased year over year to an even greater extent in the west coast region a 582 per barrel favorable increase we estimate that the increase in gasoline margins had a 10 billion favorable impact to our overall refining margin year over year as we produced 104 billion barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended december 31 2009 gasoline margins were higher in 2009 as compared to 2008 despite a decrease in gasoline prices during 2009 we believe that the margins for gasoline improved due to a greater percentage decrease in the cost of crude oil as compared to the percentage decrease in the price of gasoline 

in addition the margins we received for other products such as petroleum coke and sulfur for the year ended december 31 2009 improved by 21 billion as compared to 2008 we believe that the margins were higher in 2009 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oil in 2009 as compared to 2008 for example the benchmark reference price of wti crude oil was 6169 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 9956 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2008 representing a decrease of 3787 per barrel because the prices for these other products are not significantly influenced by the cost of crude oil changes in the cost of crude oil have a significant effect of the margins we receive for these products 

for the year ended december 31 2009  the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was lower than the differential for the year ended december 31 2008  for example maya crude oil which is a type of sour crude oil sold at a discount of 519 per barrel to wti crude oil a type of sweet crude oil during the year ended december 31 2009  this compared to a discount of 1571 per barrel during the year ended december 31 2008  representing an unfavorable decrease of 1052 per barrel however this narrower differential in 2009 was offset by a reduction of 174000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2009 as compared to 2008  which resulted primarily from the temporary shutdown of our aruba refinery commencing in july 2009 we estimate that the narrower differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process offset by reduced throughput volumes negatively impacted our overall refining margin for 2009 by 26 billion as we processed 874000 barrels per day of sour crude oils 

  

refining operating expenses were 23 percent lower or 851 million  for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a decrease of 490 million in energy costs a decrease of 171 million in maintenance expenses a decrease of 48 million in sales and use taxes and a decrease of 43 million resulting from no longer operating the krotz springs refinery which was sold in 2008 

  

  

  

retail 

retail operating income was 293 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 369 million for the year ended december 31 2008  this 21 percent decrease or 76 million was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins of 124 million offset by a 50 million decrease in operating expenses 

  

the decrease in retail fuel margins was due to the effect of significantly higher margins in 2008 the higher margins in 2008 were caused by a decrease in the supply of fuel in connection with the temporary shutdown of refineries along the us gulf coast in the wake of hurricane ike during the third quarter of 2008 many of those refineries became operational by the fourth quarter of december 2008 and fuel supply and margins returned to normal levels there were no similar events that occurred in 2009 

the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a 24 million decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in operating expenses due to the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in 2009 compared to 2008 on average cdn1 was equal to 088 during 2009 compared to 095 during 2008 representing a decrease in value of seven percent the weaker canadian dollar had an 18 million favorable impact on the 2009 operating expenses of our canadian retail operations compared to 2008 

  

ethanol 

ethanol operating income was 165 million for the year ended december 31 2009  which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 as described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements we did not own or operate any ethanol plants prior to this acquisition 

  

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses increased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 mainly due to an increase of 39 million in litigation costs an increase of 10 million in severance expenses and acquisition costs of 10 million related to the acquisition of seven ethanol plants these increases were partially offset by reductions of 29 million in environmental remediation expenses and 16 million in professional fees 

  

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 96 million from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a 128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the alon earnout agreement and associated derivative instruments as discussed in notes 20 and 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements reduced interest income of 37 million resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates and a 14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 95 senior notes as discussed in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements these decreases were partially offset by a 55 million increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and 27 million of income resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to a prior acquisition in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations 

  

interest and debt expense increased 56 million mainly due to interest incurred on 10 billion of notes issued in march 2009 

  

income tax expense decreased 15 billion from 14 billion of expense in 2008 to a 43 million benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of a significant portion of the 40 billion goodwill impairment loss in 2008 

  

“income loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 17 billion from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the 12 billion after tax loss on the permanent shut down of our delaware city refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 30 billion compared to 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a 923 million tax refund in 2010  changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2010 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline distillate and crude oil at the end of 2010 compared to such prices at the end of 2009  

  

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2010  combined with 15 billion of proceeds from the issuance of 400 million of 450 notes due in february 2015 850 million of 6125 notes due in february 2020 and 300 million of go zone bonds as discussed in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements 547 million of proceeds from the paulsboro refinery sale 220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown delaware city refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets and 330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in chops as discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements were used mainly to 

   

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 18 billion compared to 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2008  the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the 42 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss and gain on the sale of the krotz springs refinery both of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities this decrease was partially offset by a 16 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net 14 billion favorable effect from changes in receivables inventories and accounts payable between the two years changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 are shown in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline distillate and crude oil at the end of 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008 

  

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2009  combined with 998 million of proceeds from the issuance of 10 billion of notes in march 2009 as discussed in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements 799 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in june 2009 as discussed in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements 100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables and 115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to 

   

  

cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the paulsboro and delaware city refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows in millions 

  



  

capital investments 

during the year ended december 31 2010  we expended 17 billion for capital expenditures and 535 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2010 included 740 million of costs related to environmental projects 

  

for 2011 we expect to incur approximately 29 billion for capital investments including approximately 24 billion for capital expenditures approximately 260 million of which is for environmental projects and approximately 510 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

  

in january 2010 we acquired two ethanol plants and inventories for a total purchase price of 202 million  the plants are located in linden indiana and bloomingburg ohio in february 2010 we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near jefferson wisconsin plus certain receivables and inventories for a total consideration of 79 million  of the 281 million of total consideration paid for these acquisitions 21 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009  

  

on june 1 2010 we sold the shutdown delaware city refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to pbf for 220 million of cash proceeds and on december 17 2010 we sold our paulsboro refinery to pbf holding for 547 million of cash proceeds and a 160 million oneyear note secured by the paulsboro refinery 

  

  

  

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 are summarized below in millions 

  



  

debt and capital lease obligations 

during 2010 the following activity occurred related to our nonbank debt 

   

on february 1 2011 we made a scheduled debt repayment of 210 million related to our 675 senior notes on february 2 2011 we paid 300 million to acquire the go zone bonds which were subject to mandatory tender on that date we expect to hold the go zone bonds for our own account until conditions permit the remarketing of these bonds at an interest rate acceptable to us 

  

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 10 billion of eligible trade receivables which matures in june 2011 as of december 31 2010  the amount of eligible receivables sold was 100 million  during the year ended december 31 2010  we reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by 100 million  proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt 

  

  

  

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase as of december 31 2010 all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 

  



  

we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

  

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment transportation equipment time charters for oceangoing tankers and coastal vessels dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined product and corn inventories operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

  

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2010  our shortterm and longterm purchase obligations increased by 64 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2009  the increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009  

  

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2010  

  

  

  

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2010  our committed lines of credit were as follows 

  



  

as of december 31 2010  we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities the letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2010 expire during 2011 and 2012 

  

stock purchase programs 

as of december 31 2010  we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately 35 billion of our common stock 

  

pension plan funded status 

during 2010  we contributed 50 million to our qualified pension plans based on a 540 percent discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2010  the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 95 percent of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2010  

  

we have no minimum required contributions to our pension plans during 2011 under the employee retirement income security act however we plan to contribute approximately 100 million to our pension plans during 2011 

  

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 

  

while debate continues in the us congress regarding greenhouse gas legislation the regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level has now shifted to the us environmental protection agency epa which began regulating greenhouse gases on january 2 2011 under the clean air act amendments of 1990 clean air act according to statements by the epa any new construction or material expansions will require that among other things a greenhouse gas permit be issued at the state or federal level in accordance with the clean air act and regulations and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the determination will be on a case by case basis and the epa has provided only general guidance on which controls will be required any such controls however could result in material increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions for our business and an increase in the cost of the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

  

  

  

in addition certain states have pursued independent regulation of greenhouse gases at the state level for example the california global warming solutions act also known as ab 32 directs the carb to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in california to 1990 levels by 2020 carb has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal including a low carbon fuel standard lcfs as well as a statewide capandtrade program the lcfs is effective in 2011 with small reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in california the mandated reductions in carbon intensity are scheduled to increase through 2020 after which another stepchange in reductions is anticipated the lcfs is designed to encourage substitution of traditional petroleum fuels and over time it is anticipated that the lcfs will lead to a greater use of electric cars and alternative fuels such as e85 as companies seek to generate more credits to offset petroleum fuels the statewide capandtrade program will begin in 2012 initially the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases  eg  refinery and power plant greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in california will be covered by the program beginning in 2015 we anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program but we expect that compliance costs will be significant particularly beginning in 2015 when fuels are included in the program complying with ab 32 including the lcfs and the capandtrade program could result in material increased compliance costs for us increased capital expenditures increased operating costs and additional operating restrictions for our business resulting in an increase in the cost of and decreases in the demand for the products we produce to the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

  

on june 30 2010 the epa formally disapproved the flexible permits program submitted by the tceq in 1994 for inclusion in its cleanair implementation plan the epa determined that texas’ flexible permit program did not meet several requirements under the federal clean air act our port arthur texas city three rivers mckee and corpus christi east and west refineries formerly operated under flexible permits administered by the tceq in the fourth quarter of 2010 we completed the conversion of our flexible permits into federally enforceable conventional state nsr permits “deflexed permits” we are now in the process of incorporating these deflexed permits into our title v permits continued discussions with epa regarding this matter are likely 

  

meanwhile epa has formally disapproved other tceq permitting programs that historically have streamlined the environmental permitting process in texas for example epa has disapproved the tceq pollution control standard permit thus requiring conventional permitting for future pollution control equipment litigation is pending from industry groups and others against epa for each of these actions epa has also objected to numerous title v permits in texas and other states including permits at our port arthur corpus christi east and mckee refineries environmental activist groups have filed a notice of intent to sue epa seeking to require epa to assume control of these permits from the tceq all of these developments have created substantial uncertainty regarding existing and future permitting because of this uncertainty we are unable to determine the costs or effects of epa’s actions on our permitting activity but epa’s disruption of the texas permitting system could result in material increased compliance costs for us increased capital expenditures increased operating costs and additional operating restrictions for our business resulting in an increase in the cost of and decreases in the demand for the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

  

tax matters 

as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive tax liabilities new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to 

  

  

our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

  

effective june 1 2010 the goa enacted a new tax regime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in aruba under the new tax regime we are subject to a profit tax rate of 7 percent and a dividend withholding tax rate of 0 percent in addition all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees beginning june 1 2012 we will also make a minimum annual tax payment of 10 million payable in equal quarterly installments with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years 

  

the new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement that we entered into on february 24 2010 with the goa that established the terms for settlement of a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties on may 30 2010 the aruban parliament adopted several laws that implemented the provisions of the settlement agreement which became effective june 1 2010 pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement we relinquished the provisions of the previous tax holiday regime on june 4 2010 we made a payment to the goa of 118 million primarily from restricted cash held in escrow in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to june 1 2010 

  

financial regulatory reform 

on july 21 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act wall street reform act the wall street reform act among many things creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses rules to implement the wall street reform act are being finalized and therefore the impact to our operations is not yet known however implementation could result in higher margin requirements higher clearing costs and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities 

  

other 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

  

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

  

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

  

impairment of assets 

longlived assets which include property plant and equipment intangible assets and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

  

in order to test for recoverability we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations 

  

we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

  

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives as discussed in “ liquidity and capital resources – environmental matters ” could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

  

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws 

  

  

and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

  

the amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2010  2009  and 2008 is included in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements for example a 025 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2010 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2011 in millions 

  



  

see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

  

  

  

tax matters 

our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes we are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time in addition we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts 

  

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

  

legal matters 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters

overview 

in this overview we describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of operations during the year ended december 31 2009 we reported a loss from continuing operations of 352 million or 065 per share for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to a loss from continuing operations of 10 billion or 193 per share for the year ended december 31 2008 the results of continuing operations for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by asset impairment losses of 230 million 150 million after tax which are discussed further below as well as a 140 million loss contingency accrual including interest related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales and other tax matters involving the government of aruba the 2008 results included a beforetax and aftertax loss of 40 billion resulting from the impairment of goodwill which is further discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition 2008 results included 86 million of pretax asset impairment losses 56 million after tax and a 305 million pretax gain 170 million after tax on the sale of our krotz springs refinery 

in november 2009 we announced the permanent shutdown of our delaware city refinery due to financial losses caused by poor economic conditions significant capital spending requirements and high operating costs as a result of the shutdown we recorded a pretax loss of 19 billion which is discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements the results of operations of the delaware city refinery which include this loss and other asset impairment losses are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 

due to the impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals during 2009 we continued to assess our refining segment assets for potential impairment this evaluation included an assessment of our operating assets as well as an evaluation of our capital projects classified as “construction in progress” as a result of this analysis certain capital projects were permanently cancelled resulting in pretax writeoffs of 230 million of project costs relating to continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2009 additionally during 2009 we wrote off pretax project costs of 178 million related to our delaware city refinery which are reported in discontinued operations as discussed above 

also due to these poor industry conditions in june 2009 we announced our plan to shut down the aruba refinery temporarily as narrow heavy sour crude oil differentials made the refinery uneconomical to operate the aruba refinery was shut down in july 2009 and is expected to continue to be shut down until market conditions improve 

our profitability from our operations is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil referred to as the “refined product margin” the economic slowdown that existed throughout 2009 caused a continuing weakness in demand for refined products which put pressure on refined product margins during 2009 this reduced demand combined with increased inventory levels caused a significant decline in diesel and jet fuel margins during 2009 compared to 2008 however gasoline margins improved in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition lower costs of crude oil and other feedstocks significantly improved margins on certain secondary products such as asphalt fuel oils and petroleum coke during 2009 compared to 2008 

because more than 60 of our total crude oil throughput generally consists of sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices referred to as the “sour crude oil differential” sour crude oil differentials for the year ended december 31 2009 were substantially lower than the 2008 differentials we believe that this decline in sour crude oil differentials was partially caused by a reduction in sour crude oil production by opec and 

other producers which reduced the supply of sour crude oil and increased the price of sour crude oils relative to sweet crude oils in addition high prices of residual fuel oil relative to sweet crude oil prices caused a significant reduction in discounts realized on residual fuel oil that we processed during 2009 these higher residual fuel oil prices also contributed to the decrease in sour crude oil differentials because sour crude oil competes with residual fuel oil as a refinery feedstock

in march 2009 we issued 750 million of 10year notes and 250 million of 30year notes proceeds from these notes were used to make 209 million of scheduled debt payments in april 2009 fund our acquisition of certain ethanol plants from verasun and maintain our capital investment program 

in april and may of 2009 we acquired seven ethanol plants and a site under development from verasun for 477 million plus 79 million primarily for inventory and certain other working capital the new ethanol business reported 165 million of operating income for the year ended december 31 2009 

in june 2009 we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1800 per share and received proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs of 799 million

general 

operating revenues decreased 40 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two periods operating income declined 819 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the amount for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to an 890 million decrease in refining segment operating income discussed below despite the decline in operating income our income from continuing operations increased from 2008 to 2009 due to a 16 billion reduction in income tax expense largely attributable to the nondeductibility of almost all of the goodwill impairment loss that is included in the 2008 operating income as discussed further below 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment decreased from 995 million for the year ended december 31 2008 to 105 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease in operating income was attributable primarily to a 305 million gain on the sale of the krotz springs refinery in the third quarter of 2008 as further discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements a 143 million increase in asset impairment losses as further discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements a 114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in aruba as further discussed in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements a 47 decrease in throughput margin per barrel and an 8 decline in throughput volumes these decreases were partially offset by a 40 billion goodwill impairment loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as further discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements and a 16 decrease in refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense 

total refining throughput margins for 2009 compared to 2008 were impacted by the following factors 

 

 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense were 22 lower for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a decrease in energy costs lower maintenance expenses a reduction in sales and use taxes and 43 million of operating expenses related to the krotz springs refinery prior to its sale effective july 1 2008 refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 4 from the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the completion of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail operating income was 293 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 369 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this 21 decrease was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins partially offset by lower selling expenses in our us retail operations 

ethanol 

ethanol operating income was 165 million for the year ended december 31 2009 which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the verasun acquisition subsequent to their acquisition in the second quarter of 2009 as described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization expense increased 17 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 mainly due to increases in litigation costs severance expenses and acquisition costs partially offset by reductions in environmental costs and professional fees 

other income for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a 128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the alon earnout agreement and associated derivative instruments as discussed in notes 2 17 and 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates and the nonrecurrence of a 14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 95 senior notes as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements these decreases were partially offset by a 55 million increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and 27 million of income in 2009 resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to the uds acquisition due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 

interest and debt expense increased mainly due to interest incurred on 1 billion of debt issued in march 2009 

income tax expense decreased 16 billion from 15 billion of expense in 2008 to a 97 million benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of almost all of the 40 billion goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 results of operations as discussed above excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss on the effective tax rate for 2008 our 2009 effective tax rate was lower than 2008 primarily due to a higher percentage of the pretax loss being attributable to the aruba refinery in 2009 the profits or losses of which are not taxed through december 31 2010 

“loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” increased 15 billion from the year ended december 31 2008 to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the aftertax effect of the following changes in the results of operations related to the delaware city refinery i a 19 billion loss related to the permanent shutdown of the delaware city refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009 ii a 360 million increase in asset impairment losses and iii a 260 million increase in operating losses the shutdown of the delaware city refinery is discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements

general 

operating revenues increased 26 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices offsetting the higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs 

operating income decreased 59 billion or 89 and income from continuing operations decreased 54 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to a 61 billion decrease in refining segment operating income the decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of 40 billion related to continuing operations that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements the goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and regional operating income amounts for the year ended december 31 2008 for comparability purposes the refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 exclude i the operations of the lima refinery and the gain on its sale effective july 1 2007 and ii the operations of the delaware city refinery due to its permanent shutdown in november 2009 which are both classified as discontinued operations as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment decreased from 71 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 to 995 million for the year ended december 31 2008 resulting mainly from the 40 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above an 11 decrease in throughput margin per barrel a 10 increase in refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense and a 5 decline in throughput volumes these decreases were partially offset by a 305 million gain on the sale of our krotz springs refinery effective july 1 2008 which is discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors 

 

 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 061 per barrel or 16 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail operating income was 369 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 249 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this 48 increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a 0055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased instore sales in our us retail operations the significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense decreased 83 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a 13 million termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with nustar energy lp 

other income decreased for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to a 91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets these decreases were partially offset by income related to the alon earnout agreement discussed in notes 2 17 and 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements lower costs incurred under our accounts receivable sales program an increase in earnings from our equity investment in cameron highway oil pipeline company and a 14 million gain in 2008 on the redemption of our 95 senior notes as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities partially offset by higher average debt balances 

income tax expense decreased 520 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating income excluding the effect on operating income of the 40 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect excluding this goodwill impairment loss our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 

“loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes” for the year ended december 31 2008 represents a 119 million net loss on the operations of the delaware city refinery which was reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the permanent shutdown of the refinery effective november 20 2009 “income from discontinued operations net of income taxes” for the year ended december 31 2007 represents a 426 million aftertax gain on the sale of the lima refinery effective july 1 2007 243 million of net income from the lima refinery operations prior to its sale and 188 million of net income from the operations of the delaware city refinery 

outlook 

high crude oil prices in 2008 and a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009 caused a large reduction in demand for refined products over the past two years this demand reduction plus the addition of new refining capacity around the world have resulted in a significant amount of excess global refining capacity which led to an increase in global refined product inventories and lower refined product margins in addition the decrease in demand for refined products contributed to lower production of sour crude oil versus sweet crude oil which narrowed the differentials between sour and sweet crude oil prices 

as 2010 progresses we expect the united states and worldwide economies to begin to recover and we expect refined product demand to begin to grow accordingly the increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils these expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil production should result in improved refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials however improvements in refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials are expected to be significantly constrained during 2010 by the startup of new worldwide refining capacity that will mitigate the reduction in spare capacity that would otherwise result from the improved demand 

until the economy recovers and demand improves we expect that the current low refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials will result in production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry in july we temporarily shut down our aruba refinery due to poor economics resulting from the current unfavorable industry fundamentals the aruba refinery continues to be shut down temporarily and it is expected to remain shut down until industry conditions improve in addition in the fourth quarter of 2009 we permanently shut down our delaware city refinery we are currently monitoring and will continue to monitor all of our other refineries to assess whether complete or partial shutdown of certain of those facilities is appropriate until conditions improve we expect that refinery production cutbacks and shutdowns of less profitable refineries will occur throughout the refining industry during 2010 until industry conditions improve 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 18 billion compared to 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the 44 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under “ results of operations ” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss asset 

impairment losses and gain on the sale of the krotz springs refinery all of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities this decrease was partially offset by a 16 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net 14 billion favorable effect from changes in receivables inventories and accounts payable in the two years changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to a significant increase in gasoline distillate and crude oil prices at december 31 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2009 combined with 998 million of proceeds from the issuance of 1 billion of notes in march 2009 as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 799 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in june 2009 as discussed in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements 100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables and 115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 31 billion compared to 53 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “ results of operations ” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 operating income that had no effect on cash changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at december 31 2008 compared to such prices at the end of 2007 receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the lima refinery to husky and the timing of receivable collections at yearend 2007 the change in working capital for 2007 includes a 900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2008 combined with 15 billion of available cash on hand and 463 million of proceeds from the sale of our krotz springs refinery were used mainly to 

 

cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the delaware city refinery and the lima refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows in millions 

 

capital investments 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we expended 23 billion for capital expenditures and 415 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2009 included 390 million of costs related to environmental projects

for 2010 we expect to incur approximately 20 billion for capital investments including approximately 15 billion for capital expenditures approximately 795 million of which is for environmental projects and approximately 510 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

in january 2010 we acquired two ethanol plants from asa ethanol holdings llc for a total purchase price of approximately 200 million the plants are located in linden indiana and bloomingburg ohio in february 2010 we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near jefferson wisconsin from renew energy llc for 72 million plus certain receivables and inventories 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 are summarized below in millions

 

debt and capital lease obligations 

payments for debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and minimum rental payments respectively

in march 2009 we issued 750 million of 9375 notes due march 15 2019 and 250 million of 105 notes due march 15 2039 proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled 998 million before deducting underwriting discounts and other issuance costs of 8 million 

on april 1 2009 we made scheduled debt repayments of 200 million related to our 35 notes and 9 million related to our 5125 series 1997d industrial revenue bonds 

on october 15 2009 we redeemed 76 million of our 100 million of 675 senior notes with a maturity date of october 15 2037 as further discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 1 billion of eligible trade receivables we amended our agreement in june 2009 to extend the maturity date to june 2010 as of december 31 2008 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty entities and financial institutions was 100 million during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold additional eligible receivables under this program of 950 million and repaid 850 million as of december 31 2009 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty entities and financial institutions was 200 million subsequent to december 31 2009 we have reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by 100 million resulting in a current balance of 100 million of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty entities and financial institutions proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheets 

in february 2010 we issued 400 million of 450 notes due in february 2015 and 850 million of 6125 notes due in february 2020 proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled approximately 124 billion before deducting underwriting discounts of 8 million and will be used for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of debt 

also in february 2010 we called for redemption our 750 senior notes with a maturity date of june 15 2015 for 294 million or 1025 of stated value the redemption date will be march 15 2010 these notes will have a carrying amount of 296 million as of the redemption date resulting in a small gain on the redemption 

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 

 

we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment dock facilities transportation equipment and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases the operating lease

obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in “other longterm liabilities” 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2009 our shortterm and longterm purchase obligations increased by 93 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2008 the increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008

other longterm liabilities 

our other longterm liabilities are described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2009

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2009 our committed lines of credit were as follows

 

in october 2009 aurora bank fsb aurora formerly lehman brothers bank fsb one of the participating banks under our 25 billion revolving credit facility failed to fund its loan commitment related to our borrowing under this facility aurora’s aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility was 84 million as a result our borrowing capacity under that revolving credit facility was effectively reduced to 24 billion 

in june 2008 we entered into a oneyear committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to 300 million to support certain of our crude oil purchases in june 2009 we amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to june 2010 we are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with this letter of credit facility 

as of december 31 2009 we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities however we had 259 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted shortterm bank credit facilities 299 million of letters of credit outstanding under our two us committed revolving credit facilities and cdn 22 million of letters of credit outstanding under our canadian committed revolving credit facility these letters of credit expire during 2010 and 2011 

common stock offering 

on june 3 2009 we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock which included 6 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriters at a price of 1800 per share and received proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs of 799 million

stock purchase programs 

as of december 31 2009 we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately 35 billion of our common stock

pension plan funded status 

during 2009 we contributed 72 million to our qualified pension plans based on a 580 discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2009 the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 97 of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2009

we have less than 1 million of minimum required contributions to our qualified plans during 2010 under the employee retirement income security act however we plan to contribute approximately 50 million to our qualified plans during 2010 of which 30 million was contributed during february 2010 

environmental matters 

as discussed in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations

currently some of the proposed federal “capandtrade” legislation would require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government other businesses or through an auction process in addition refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated with the transportation fuels gasoline diesel and jet fuel sold and consumed in the united states as a result of such a program we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell although it is not possible at this time to predict the final form of a capandtrade bill or whether such a bill will be passed by congress any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions – including a capandtrade program – could result in material increased compliance costs additional operating restrictions for our business and an increase in the cost of the products we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity 

tax matters 

as discussed in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive tax liabilities new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties

effective january 1 2007 the government of aruba goa enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in aruba the turnover tax which initially was 3 for onisland sales and services but has subsequently been reduced to 15 and 1 on export sales is being assessed by the goa on sales by our aruba refinery we disputed the goa’s assessment of the turnover tax in arbitration proceedings with the netherlands arbitration institute nai pursuant to which we sought to enforce our rights under a tax holiday agreement related to the refinery and other agreements the arbitration hearing was held on february 34 2009 we also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in aruba 

in april 2008 we entered into an escrow agreement with the goa and caribbean mercantile bank nv cmb pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on exports into an escrow account with cmb pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in aruba under this escrow agreement we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the aruba proceedings on april 20 2009 we were notified that the aruban tax court overruled our protests with respect to the turnover tax assessed in january and february 2007 totaling 8 million under the escrow agreement we expensed and paid 8 million plus 1 million of interest to the goa in the second quarter of 2009 amounts deposited under the escrow agreement which totaled 115 million and 102 million as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively are reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets in addition to the turnover tax described above the goa has asserted other tax amounts including approximately 35 million related to various dividends we also challenged approximately 35 million in foreign exchange payments made to the central bank of aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday as well as other reasons both the dividend tax and the foreign exchange payment matters were also addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed above 

on november 3 2009 we received an interim first partial award from the nai arbitral panel the panel’s ruling validated our tax holiday agreement but the panel also ruled in favor of the goa on our dispute of the 35 million in foreign exchange payments previously made to the central bank of aruba the panel’s decision did not however fully resolve the remaining two items in the arbitration the applicable dividend tax rate and the turnover tax with respect to the dividend tax the panel ruled that the dividend tax was not a profit tax covered by the tax holiday agreement but the panel did not address the fact that aruban companies with tax holidays are subject to a 0 dividend withholding rate rather than the 5 rate alleged by the goa with respect to the turnover tax the panel did reject our contractual claims but it decided that our noncontractual claims against the turnover tax merited further discussion with and review by the panel before a final decision could be rendered prior to this interim decision no expense or liability had been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to unfunded amounts in light of the uncertain timing of any final resolution of these claims as a result of the first partial award from the panel we recorded a loss contingency accrual of approximately 140 million including interest with respect to both the dividend and turnover taxes 

following the november ruling we entered into settlement discussions with the goa on february 24 2010 we signed a settlement agreement that details the parties’ proposed terms for settlement of these disputes and provides a framework for taxation of our operations in aruba on a goforward basis as our tax holiday was set to expire on december 31 2010 under the proposed settlement we will make a payment to the goa of 118 million in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to the effective date of the settlement including the turnover tax disputed in the netherlands arbitration the goa will eliminate the turnover tax on exports as of the effective date of the settlement in addition we will agree to exit the tax holiday regime following the effective date of the settlement agreement and will enter into a new tax regime under which we will be subject to a net profit tax of less than 10 on an overall basis beginning on the second anniversary of the settlement agreement’s effective date we will also begin to make an annual prepayment of taxes of 10 million with the ability to carry forward any 

excess tax prepayments to future tax years the proposed settlement will not be effective until the settlement agreement is approved by the aruban parliament and certain laws and regulations are modified andor established to provide for the terms of the settlement the parties anticipate that this will occur on or before june 1 2010 if the settlement is not effective as of june 1 2010 we both have the right to terminate the settlement agreement and return to arbitration and the onisland proceedings to continue litigation

other 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets excluding goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives equity method investments and deferred tax assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the

carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations 

due to the effect of the current unfavorable economic conditions on the refining industry and our expectations of a continuation of such conditions for the near term we will continue to monitor both our operating assets and our capital projects for additional potential asset impairments until conditions improve due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions as well as changes in assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair values and changes in potential asset sales proceeds could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be reasonable providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates 

environmental liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives such as potential capandtrade legislation as discussed in “ liquidity and capital resources – environmental matters ” could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is included in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2009 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2010 in millions

 

see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

tax liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes we are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time in addition we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the 

sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes see note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities 

legal liabilities 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss see note 25 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil refined product and grain prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges from time to time we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases cash flow hedges we also use commodity derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income finally we enter into commodity derivative instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes see “ derivatives and hedging ” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions 

the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following tables provide information about our commodity derivative instruments as of december 31 2009 and 2008 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including 

fair value hedges – fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories which had a carrying amount of 44 billion as of both december 31 2009 and 2008 and a fair value of 89 billion and 51 billion as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and our unrecognized firm commitments  ie binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period

cash flow hedges – cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument if any is recognized in income as incurred

economic hedges – economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to

 

in addition through august 2009 we used economic hedges to manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the threeyear earnout agreement with alon that was entered into in connection with the sale of our krotz springs refinery but which was settled in the third quarter of 2009 as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements the derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income

interest rate risk 

in general our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt in addition we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense the recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2009 and 2008

foreign currency risk 

we enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge 

as of december 31 2009 we had commitments to purchase 456 million of us dollars and commitments to sell 604 million of us dollars these commitments matured on or before february 1 2010 resulting in a 3 million loss in the first quarter of 2010

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with items 1 1a and 2 “business risk factors and properties” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” included in this report in the discussions that follow all pershare amounts assume dilution 

cautionary statement for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

this report including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading “ results of operations – outlook ” includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 you can identify our forwardlooking statements by the words “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “plan” “intend” “estimate” “project” “projection” “predict” “budget” “forecast” “goal” “guidance” “target” “could” “should” “may” and similar expressions 

these forwardlooking statements include among other things statements regarding 

 

we based our forwardlooking statements on our current expectations estimates and projections about ourselves and our industry we caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict in addition we based many of these forwardlooking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forwardlooking statements differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forwardlooking statements could result from a variety of factors including the following 

 

 

any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forwardlooking statements ultimately prove to be accurate our forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forwardlooking statements we do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so 

all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forwardlooking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

overview 

in this overview we describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of operations during the year ended december 31 2008 we reported a loss from continuing operations of 11 billion or 216 per share for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to income from continuing operations of 46 billion or 772 per share for the year ended december 31 2007 the 2008 results included a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of 41 billion 40 billion after tax resulting from the impairment of goodwill 

the goodwill impairment loss which represented a writeoff of the entire balance of our goodwill was associated with a significant decline in our market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2008 that resulted in large part from severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets in performing our goodwill impairment test under applicable accounting rules we estimate fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows from our refineries the decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in the use of higher riskadjusted discount rates in determining the fair values of our reporting units which reflected the significant risk premium implied by our stock price as of december 31 2008 as a result of applying these higher discount rates to the cash flows of our reporting units the fair values in each of our reporting units were below their net book values including goodwill thus indicating potential impairment due to this conclusion of potential impairment existing accounting rules required additional analysis for each of the reporting units to determine the amount of the loss and this additional analysis indicated that all of the goodwill in each of our reporting units should be written off 

effective july 1 2008 we sold our refinery in krotz springs louisiana to a subsidiary of alon usa energy inc the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 305 million or 170 million after tax as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements net cash proceeds from the sale were 463 million including approximately 135 million from the sale of working capital in addition we received contingent consideration in the form of a threeyear earnout agreement based on certain product margins 

our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil referred to as the “refined product margin” the weakening of industry fundamentals for refined products that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 continued throughout 2008 gasoline margins declined significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to 2007 the decline in margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production margins on certain secondary refined products such as petroleum coke and petrochemical feedstocks also declined during 2008 due to a significant increase in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks used to produce them however these decreases were partially offset by the effect of favorable diesel margins in 2008 which increased compared to 2007 primarily due to strong global demand 

because more than 65 of our total crude oil throughput consists of sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices referred to as the “sour crude oil differential” during 2008 sour crude oil differentials remained wide and improved somewhat in 2008 compared to 2007 levels 

regarding operations on january 25 2008 our aruba refinery was shut down due to a fire in its vacuum unit we resumed partial operation of the refinery in midfebruary and during the second quarter of 2008 we completed the repairs and resumed full operations of the refinery during the third quarter of 2008 certain of our refineries were shut down as a result of two hurricanes that impacted the gulf coast 

although we avoided major damage from the hurricanes repair costs and downtime attributable to the hurricanes and the aruba downtime reduced our results of operations for 2008 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from 012 per share to 015 per share and purchased 230 million shares of our common stock under our boardauthorized programs which represented more than 4 of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2008 we also redeemed 350 million of 95 callable debt that was due in 2013 and invested 32 billion in capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs

general 

operating revenues increased 25 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices refined product prices were significantly higher in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 but fourth quarter 2008 refined product prices declined to levels substantially below the fourth quarter of 2007 this resulted in a 101 billion decrease in fourth quarter 2008 revenues compared to 2007 which lowered the revenue increase for the year to 238 billion offsetting the higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs 

operating income decreased 64 billion or 92 and income from continuing operations decreased 57 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to a 66 billion decrease in refining segment operating income the decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of 41 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements also see “ impairment of assets ” under “ critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates ” below for a detailed analysis of the methodology and assumptions used in the determination of this goodwill impairment loss the goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and regional operating income amounts for the year ended december 31 2008 for comparability purposes the refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 exclude the operations of the lima refinery and the gain on its sale which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery effective july 1 2007 as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment decreased from 74 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 to 797 million for the year ended december 31 2008 resulting mainly from the 41 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above a 12 decrease in throughput margin per barrel a 12 increase in refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense and a 6 decline in throughput volumes these decreases were partially offset by a 305 million gain on the sale of our krotz springs refinery effective july 1 2008 which is discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors 

 

 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 078 per barrel or 20 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 perbarrel operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs as well as the effect of the throughput volume decline discussed above refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 9 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail operating income was 369 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 249 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this 48 increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a 0055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased instore sales in our us retail operations the significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense decreased 83 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a 13 million termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with nustar energy lp 

“other income net” decreased for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to a 91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets these decreases were partially offset by income related to the alon earnout agreement discussed in notes 2 and 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements lower costs incurred under our accounts receivable sales program an increase in earnings from our equity investment in cameron highway oil pipeline company and a 14 million gain in 2008 on the redemption of our 95 senior notes as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities partially offset by higher average debt balances 

income tax expense decreased 694 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating income excluding the effect on operating income of the 41 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect excluding this goodwill impairment loss our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 

income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2007 represents a 426 million aftertax gain on the sale of the lima refinery effective july 1 2007 and net income from its operations prior to the sale

general 

operating revenues increased 9 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices operating income decreased 804 million or 10 and income from continuing operations decreased 722 million or 14 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to an 827 million decrease in refining segment operating income the refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the lima refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment decreased from 82 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 to 74 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 resulting mainly from increased refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of 631 million in addition total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by 196 million due to a 014 per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 040 per barrel or 11 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense employee compensation and related benefits outside services and energy costs as well as increased accruals for sales and use taxes refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24 from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects increased turnaround and catalyst amortization and the writeoff of costs related to the mckee refinery as a result of a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit in february 2007 

total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors 

 

 

retail 

retail operating income was 249 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 182 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this 37 increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased instore sales and improved retail fuel margins in our us and canadian retail operations partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 44 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses an increase in employee compensation and benefits including incentive compensation a 13 million termination fee paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with nustar energy lp and increased charitable contributions partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to premcor headquarters personnel that were not incurred during 2007 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2007 included a 91 million pretax gain related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary “other income net” for the year ended december 31 2006 included a pretax gain of 328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in nustar gp holdings llc as discussed in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding these effects “other income net” increased 54 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007 

interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 225 billion of notes in june 2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements increased interest on tax liabilities and reduced capitalized interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction 

income tax expense decreased 450 million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased from the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of pretax income contributed by the aruba refinery the profits of which are nontaxable in aruba through december 31 2010 combined with favorable tax law changes 

income from discontinued operations net of income tax expense increased 493 million from the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2007 due primarily to a pretax gain of 827 million or 426 million after tax on the sale of the lima refinery in july 2007 combined with a 67 million increase in net income from the operations of the lima refinery between the two years the increase in net income from the operations of the lima refinery was mainly attributable to a 94 increase in the refinery’s throughput margin per barrel from 899 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2006 to 1741 per barrel for the six months ended june 30 2007 which more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of operations in 2007 prior to its sale 

outlook 

based on current forward market indicators we expect both refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials for 2009 to be lower than the corresponding amounts reported in 2008 we expect the current economic slowdown to unfavorably impact demand for refined products although gasoline margins in the first quarter of 2009 have recovered somewhat from the negative margins experienced in late 2008 gasoline margins are expected to remain under pressure until demand begins to recover distillate margins are also expected to be unfavorably affected by reduced demand attributable to the current economic recession we believe that distillate margins will continue to depend primarily on the pace of global economic activity and the rate at which new refining capacity is brought online 

in regard to feedstocks thus far in 2009 sour crude oil differentials have decreased from fourth quarter 2008 levels and are expected to remain lower for the first half of 2009 reduced overall crude oil production by opec has caused a reduction in the supply of sour crude oil and a resulting increase in the price of such crude oils relative to sweet crude oils in light of the current and expanding weakness in the us and global economies we expect 2009 will be a challenging year for the refining industry and our company 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 30 billion compared to 53 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “ results of operations ” after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 operating income that had no effect on cash changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at december 31 2008 compared to such prices at the end of 2007 receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the lima refinery to husky and the timing of receivable collections at yearend 2007 the change in working capital for 2007 includes a 900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility as discussed below in the discussion of 2007 versus 2006 cash flows 

see the 2007 cash flow discussion below for information related to the cash flows of the discontinued operations of the lima refinery 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2008 combined with 15 billion of available cash on hand and 463 million of proceeds from the sale of our krotz springs refinery were used mainly to 

 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 53 billion compared to 63 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “ results of operations ” and a 900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility as discussed in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline distillate and crude oil prices at december 31 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006 

cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the lima refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash flows for each period presented cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was 260 million and 215 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively cash used in investing activities related to the lima refinery was 14 million and 133 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

capital investments during the year ended december 31 2008 we expended 28 billion for capital expenditures and 408 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2008 included 479 million of costs related to environmental projects 

in connection with our acquisition of the st charles refinery in 2003 the seller was entitled to receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level see the discussion in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements payments due under this earnout arrangement were limited based on annual and aggregate limits in january 2008 we made a 25 million earnout payment related to the st charles refinery which was the final payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement subsequent to this payment we have no further commitments with respect to contingent earnout agreements 

for 2009 we expect to incur approximately 27 billion for capital investments including approximately 22 billion for capital expenditures approximately 635 million of which is for environmental projects and approximately 490 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure 

estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant

krotz springs refinery disposition effective july 1 2008 we consummated the sale of our krotz springs refinery to alon refining krotz springs inc alon a subsidiary of alon usa energy inc the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 305 million or 170 million after tax cash proceeds net of certain costs related to the sale were 463 million including approximately 135 million from the sale of working capital to alon primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary in addition to the cash consideration received we also received contingent consideration in the form of a threeyear earnout agreement based on certain product margins which had a fair value of 171 million as of july 1 2008 we have hedged the risk of a decline in the referenced product margins by entering into certain commodity derivative contracts in addition we entered into various agreements with alon as further described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 are summarized below in millions 

 

debt and capital lease obligations payments for debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and minimum rental payments respectively 

on february 1 2008 we redeemed our 950 senior notes for 367 million or 10475 of stated value in addition in march 2008 we made a scheduled debt repayment of 7 million related to certain of our other debt 

as of december 31 2008 “current portion of debt and capital lease obligations” as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of 200 million related to our 35 notes that matures in april 2009 100 million of debt secured by certain of our accounts receivable that matures in june 2009 discussed below and the remaining 9 million of our 5125 series 1997d industrial revenue bonds that matures in april 2009 

we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 1 billion of eligible trade receivables in june 2008 we amended the agreement to extend the maturity date from august 2008 to june 2009 as of december 31 2008 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty entities and financial institutions was 100 million the proceeds from the sale are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 the amount outstanding as of december 31 2008 was repaid in february 2009 note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements includes additional discussion of this program 

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment 

grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase as of december 31 2008 all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 

 

we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and longterm financing and the cost of such financings 

operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment dock facilities transportation equipment and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases the operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in “other longterm liabilities” 

purchase obligations a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2008 our shortterm and longterm purchase obligations decreased by 182 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2007 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower crude oil and other feedstock prices at december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 

other longterm liabilities our “other longterm liabilities” are described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2008 

other commercial commitments as of december 31 2008 our committed lines of credit were as follows 

 

in june 2008 we entered into a oneyear committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to 300 million in july 2008 we entered into another oneyear committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to 275 million both of these credit facilities support certain of our crude oil purchases we are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with these letter of credit facilities 

as of december 31 2008 we had 201 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted shortterm bank credit facilities 431 million of letters of credit outstanding under our three us committed revolving credit facilities and cdn 19 million of letters of credit outstanding under our canadian committed revolving credit facility these letters of credit expire during 2009 and 2010 

stock purchase programs on february 28 2008 our board of directors approved a new 3 billion common stock purchase program this program is in addition to the remaining amount under the 6 billion program previously authorized this new 3 billion program has no expiration date as of december 31 2008 we had made no purchases of our common stock under the new 3 billion program as of december 31 2008 we have approvals under these stock purchase programs to purchase approximately 35 billion of our common stock 

during 2008 we purchased 180 million shares of our common stock for 667 million under our 6 billion common stock purchase program and 50 million shares for 288 million in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans these purchases represented approximately 4 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2008 

pension plan funded status during 2008 we contributed 110 million to our qualified pension plans based on a 540 discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2008 the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 76 of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2008 the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was in excess of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of december 31 2007 however due primarily to a significant decline in the fair value of the plan assets during 2008 resulting from unfavorable economic and market conditions the qualified pension plans were underfunded as of december 31 2008 

although we have only 8 million of minimum required contributions to our qualified plans during 2009 under the employee retirement income security act we plan to contribute approximately 130 million to our qualified plans during 2009 in january 2009 50 million of this total expected contribution was contributed to our main qualified plan 

environmental matters as discussed in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas 

emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 

tax matters as discussed in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive tax liabilities new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

effective january 1 2007 the government of aruba goa enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in aruba the turnover tax which is 3 for onisland sales and services and 1 on export sales is being assessed by the goa on sales by our aruba refinery however due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our aruba refinery by the goa through december 31 2010 as well as other reasons we believe that exports by our aruba refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax accordingly no expense or liability has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to this turnover tax on exports we commenced arbitration proceedings with the netherlands arbitration institute pursuant to which we are seeking to enforce our rights under the tax holiday and other agreements related to the refinery the arbitration hearing was held on february 34 2009 we anticipate a decision sometime later this year we have also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in aruba in april 2008 we entered into an escrow agreement with the goa and caribbean mercantile bank nv cmb pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on exports into an escrow account with cmb pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in aruba under this escrow agreement we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the aruba proceedings amounts deposited under this escrow agreement which totaled 102 million as of december 31 2008 are reflected as “restricted cash” in our consolidated balance sheet 

in addition to the turnover tax described above the goa has also asserted other tax amounts aggregating approximately 25 million related to dividends and other tax items the goa through the arbitration is also now questioning the validity of the tax holiday generally although the goa has never issued any formal assessment for profit tax at any time during the tax holiday period we believe that the provisions of our tax holiday agreement exempt us from all of these taxes and accordingly no expense or liability has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements we are also challenging approximately 30 million in foreign exchange payments made to the central bank of aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday as well as other reasons these taxes and assessments are also being addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed above 

other in july 2008 we entered into an agreement to participate as a prospective shipper on the 500000 barrelperday expansion of the keystone crude oil pipeline system which is expected to be completed by 2012 once completed the pipeline will enable crude oil to be transported from western canada to the us gulf coast at port arthur texas in addition to our commitment to ship crude oil through the pipeline we have an option to acquire an equity interest in the keystone partnerships we have also secured commitments from several canadian oil producers to sell to us heavy sour crude oil for shipment through the pipeline 

during the first quarter of 2007 our mckee refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit resulting in business interruption losses for which we submitted claims to our insurance 

carriers under our insurance policies we reached a settlement with the insurance carriers on our claims resulting in pretax income of approximately 100 million in the first quarter of 2008 that was recorded as a reduction to “cost of sales” 

on january 25 2008 our aruba refinery was shut down due to a fire in its vacuum unit during the second quarter we completed the repairs and resumed full operations of the refinery this incident reduced our operating income for the year ended december 31 2008 

in november 2007 we announced plans to explore strategic alternatives related to our aruba refinery we are continuing to pursue potential transactions for this refinery which may include the sale of the refinery 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

impairment of assets longlived assets excluding goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives equity method investments and deferred tax assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 

goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings due to adverse changes in market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed further below in our discussion of goodwill we evaluated our significant operating assets for potential impairment as of december 31 2008 and we determined that the carrying amount of each of these assets was recoverable our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be reasonable providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates 

in regard to goodwill we have historically performed our goodwill impairment test as of october 1 of each year however during the fourth quarter of 2008 there were severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets that contributed to a significant decline in our common stock price thus causing our market capitalization to decline to a level substantially below our net book value because a low market capitalization relative to net book value represents a key indicator that goodwill may be impaired we determined that goodwill needed to be evaluated for impairment as of december 31 2008 in addition to our normal annual testing date as of the date of this goodwill impairment evaluation all of our goodwill was allocated among four reporting units namely each of the four geographic regions of our refining segment the gulf coast midcontinent northeast and west coast regions no goodwill was reported in our retail segment 

goodwill impairment testing is comprised of two steps the first step step 1 is to compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value including any goodwill assigned to that reporting unit if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its recorded net book value no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required if however the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its recorded net book value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test step 2 is required to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment loss if any in the second step the estimated fair value derived for the reporting unit in step 1 is deemed to represent the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of that reporting unit the fair values of each of the reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities are determined as they would be in a purchase business combination and the excess of the deemed purchase price over the net fair value of all of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of the goodwill of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of that reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds this implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to the implied fair value determined in this hypothetical purchase price allocation 

because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available the impairment testing rules required management to exercise its judgment to determine the estimated fair values of our four reporting units for purposes of performing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test management considered the cyclicality of the refining business in deriving the set of prices that were applied to the anticipated charge and production volumes in each reporting unit in determining the present values of each reporting unit’s cash flow streams management utilized discount rates that were commensurate with the risks involved in the assets to this applicable discount rate management added a reasonable risk premium in order to consider the impact of volatility within the refining industry and current tightness in the capital markets on an investor’s required rate of return 

an important requirement related to this fair value determination process is to reconcile the sum of the fair values determined for the various reporting units to our market capitalization in order to perform this reconciliation we first determined a fair value for our retail segment using an appropriate discount rate then we compared the sum of the fair values of the retail segment and the four refining reporting units to our total enterprise value with our market capitalization determined based on our common stock price as of december 31 2008 for this purpose we also added a control premium to our market capitalization in recognition of the fact that an acquiring entity generally is willing to pay more for equity ownership that gives it a controlling interest than an individual investor would pay for shares that constitute less than a controlling interest the control premium that we added to our market capitalization represented a reasonable premium for acquisitions in our industry because the enterprise value including the control premium was comparable to the sum of the fair values determined above we concluded that the assumptions utilized to determine the fair values of our reporting units were reasonable the computed fair value of each of the reporting units was less than its net book value including goodwill and therefore the goodwill in each of the reporting units was potentially impaired 

we then applied step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to each of the reporting units with the fair value for each reporting unit derived in step 1 constituting the assumed purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of each of those reporting units in allocating value to the property plant and equipment of each of the reporting units we used current replacement costs for the refineries that comprised each reporting unit and applied a depreciation factor based on historical depreciation we adjusted deferred income taxes based on the fair value assigned to property plant and equipment and reflected the fair value of inventory and other working capital included in each reporting unit our calculations indicated that the net fair value of each reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities was significantly in excess of the deemed purchase price and therefore no implied fair value of goodwill existed in any of the four reporting units as a result we concluded that an impairment of the entire amount of recorded goodwill was required which resulted in a 41 billion pretax goodwill impairment loss or 40 billion after tax in the fourth quarter of 2008 

environmental liabilities our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental 

laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is included in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various longterm bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65 equities and 35 bonds which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2008 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2009 in millions 

 

tax liabilities our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes we are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time in addition we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and 

different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes 

legal liabilities a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges from time to time we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases cash flow hedges we also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income finally we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes see “derivative instruments” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions 

the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors 

the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2008 and 2007 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including 

fair value hedges – fair value hedges are used to hedge certain recognized refining inventories which had a carrying amount of 44 billion and 38 billion as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and a fair value of 51 billion and 100 billion as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and our unrecognized firm commitments  ie binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period

cash flow hedges – cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument if any is recognized in income as incurred

economic hedges – economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to

 

the derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income 

trading activities – these represent derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes the derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income

the following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the weightedaverage pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million british thermal units for natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements for futures the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume while the market value amount represents the periodend market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume the pretax fair value for futures swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract the pretax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes for futures and options the pretax fair value represents i the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions or ii the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions additionally for futures and options the weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weightedaverage receive price represents the contract price for short positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for options represents their strike price 

 

 

 

interest rate risk 

in general our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt in addition we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense the recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2008 and 2007 

the following table provides information about our debt instruments dollars in millions the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

we enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge 

as of december 31 2008 we had commitments to purchase 280 million of us dollars our market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 30 2009 resulting in a 2009 gain of 2 million

overview 

in this overview we discuss the major transactions of our business during the year ended december 31 2007 and describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of operations during the year although we reported strong earnings from continuing operations for 2007 they decreased from comparable earnings reported in 2006 we reported income from continuing operations of 46 billion or 772 per share for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 53 billion or 836 per share for the year ended december 31 2006 our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil referred to as the “refined product margin” gasoline and distillate margins in 2007 improved compared to such margins in 2006 primarily due to supply limitations caused by industrywide refinery downtime both planned and unplanned lower imports into the united states and tighter product specifications however rapidly rising crude oil prices resulted in lower margins for certain of our secondary products such as asphalt fuel oils petroleum coke and sulfur the prices of which did not increase nearly as much as the cost of the feedstocks used to produce them 

in addition our contribution to earnings resulting from processing sour crude oil rather than sweet crude oil at many of our refineries decreased compared to 2006 since more than 60 of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil our profitability is significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices referred to as the “sour crude oil differential” sour crude oil differentials relative to wti crude oil for 2007 although good decreased compared to the strong differentials in 2006 

the fourth quarter of 2007 demonstrated the advantages of our complex and geographically diverse refining system while refined product margins were reduced due to a significant increase in feedstock costs relative to product prices our complex refineries were able to mitigate this unfavorable effect by benefiting from wide sour crude oil differentials in addition while product margins in the west coast region were low we were able to compensate somewhat for the effect of the low west coast margins with earnings in the other geographic regions in which we operate 

on february 16 2007 our mckee refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit which reduced operating income by approximately 325 million during the year ended december 31 2007 the refinery recommenced operations in april at a reduced throughput rate with run rates increasing to near full capacity by the end of the third quarter of 2007 all repairs have now been completed and the refinery is running at normal capacity as of february 2008 

effective july 1 2007 we sold our refinery in lima ohio to husky refining company husky a wholly owned subsidiary of husky energy inc the sales price was approximately 24 billion including approximately 550 million from the sale of working capital to husky primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 827 million during 2007 we also recognized a pretax gain of 91 million related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary in the second quarter of 2007 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program under which we purchased 421 million shares of our common stock which was subsequently funded mainly with proceeds from our issuance of 225 billion of new debt during 2007 

during 2007 we continued our ongoing effort to increase shareholder value by using a balanced approach to allocating our cash flow for the year ended december 31 2007 we generated 53 billion of net cash from operating activities using portions of that cash to increase our 2007 common stock dividends from 008 per share to 012 per share and to purchase 422 million shares of our common stock in addition to the 421 million shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above during 2007 we repurchased 14 of our shares that were outstanding at the beginning of 2007  we also invested 28 billion of capital into our refining system and other assets

general 

operating revenues increased 9 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices operating income decreased 804 million or 10 and income from continuing operations decreased 722 million or 14 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to an 827 million decrease in refining segment operating income the refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the lima refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment decreased from 82 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 to 74 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 resulting mainly from increased refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of 631 million in addition total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by 196 million due to a 014 per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased 040 per barrel or 11 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense employee compensation and related benefits outside services and energy costs as well as increased accruals for sales and use taxes refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24 from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects increased turnaround and catalyst amortization and the writeoff of costs related to the mckee refinery as a result of a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit in february 2007 

total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors 

 

retail 

retail operating income was 249 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 182 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this 37 increase in operating income was primarily attributable to 

increased instore sales and improved retail fuel margins in our us and canadian retail operations partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 44 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses an increase in employee compensation and benefits including incentive compensation a 13 million termination fee paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with nustar energy lp and increased charitable contributions partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to premcor headquarters personnel that were not incurred during 2007 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2007 included a 91 million pretax gain related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary “other income net” for the year ended december 31 2006 included a pretax gain of 328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in nustar gp holdings llc as discussed in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding these effects “other income net” increased 54 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007 

interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of 225 billion of notes in june 2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements increased interest on tax liabilities and reduced capitalized interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction 

income tax expense decreased 450 million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased from the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of pretax income contributed by the aruba refinery the profits of which are nontaxable in aruba through december 31 2010 combined with favorable tax law changes 

income from discontinued operations net of income tax expense increased 493 million from the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2007 due primarily to a pretax gain of 827 million or 426 million after tax on the sale of the lima refinery in july 2007 combined with a 67 million increase in net income from the operations of the lima refinery between the two years the increase in net income from the operations of the lima refinery was mainly attributable to a 94 increase in the refinery’s throughput margin per barrel from 899 per barrel for the year ended december 31 2006 to 1741 per barrel for the six months ended june 30 2007 which more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of operations in 2007 prior to its sale

 general 

operating revenues increased 9 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from the former premcor refinery operations operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2006 increased significantly compared to the year ended december 31 2005 operating income increased 25 billion or 47 from 2005 to 2006 due to a 25 billion increase in the refining segment the refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the lima refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment increased from 57 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 to 82 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 resulting from a 15 increase in throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of 137 per barrel or 12 partially offset by increased refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of 11 billion in addition the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a 621 million pretax lifo charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the premcor acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying valero’s lifo accounting policy 

the change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following factors 

 

 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense were 29 higher for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily due to the premcor acquisition on september 1 2005 excluding the effect of the premcor acquisition operating expenses increased 5 due mainly to increases in maintenance expense employee compensation and related benefits outside services and catalyst and chemicals partially offset by reduced energy costs refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 38 from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the premcor acquisition the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail operating income was 182 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 154 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this 18 increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased instore sales in the us system 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 47 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits stockbased compensation expense environmental expenses and charitable contributions as well as the favorable resolution of a california excise tax dispute in 2005 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses attributable to premcor headquarters personnel 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2006 included a pretax gain of 328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in nustar gp holdings llc as discussed in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the premcor acquisition partially offset by a reduction in other debt outstanding capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects including projects at the three former premcor refineries 

income tax expense increased 990 million from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55 increase in income from continuing operations before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 increased from the year ended december 31 2005 as a lower percentage of our pretax income was contributed by the aruba refinery the profits of which are nontaxable in aruba through december 31 2010 this increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the effects of new tax legislation in both texas and canada in 2006 

outlook 

based on current forward market indicators our outlook for refined product margins for the remainder of 2008 is positive with respect to the gasoline market wintergrade gasoline inventories increased in late 2007 and early 2008 in anticipation of the normal cycle of industrywide plant maintenance that occurs in the first quarter as spring maintenance activities occur refined product supplies are expected to decline in addition the industry will soon be making the transition from wintergrade gasoline to summergrade gasoline which is more difficult and costly to produce due to more stringent specifications and thus generally contributes to a decline in inventories furthermore we expect strong diesel margins to continue and provide an incentive to refiners to maximize diesel production thereby further limiting gasoline supplies these anticipated supply constraints combined with a typical seasonal increase in demand are expected to result in higher gasoline margins as the summer driving season approaches 

our outlook for onroad diesel margins is also favorable as onroad diesel demand continues to be good and onroad diesel inventory levels in 2008 are below 2007 levels on a daysofsupply basis as a result we expect onroad diesel margins to remain strong 

in regard to feedstocks sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable during 2008 residual fuel oil prices have not increased as much as crude oil prices which should support wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for a portion of their sour crude oil requirements if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to process than crude oil in addition new supplies of medium sour crude oil from the gulf of mexico in 2008 should contribute to continuing wide sour crude oil differentials 

on january 25 2008 our aruba refinery experienced a fire in its vacuum unit we are in the process of making the necessary repairs and we resumed partial operation of the refinery in midfebruary we expect to resume full operations in the second quarter of 2008 although we have not completed our assessment of the extent of damages we do not believe that this incident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2008 

regarding other operations for 2008 we began scheduled maintenance on our coker drums at our port arthur refinery in the first quarter that will reduce throughput volumes in the gulf coast region for about three months beginning in early february otherwise our turnaround schedule for 2008 is relatively light which should benefit our results of operations during the year 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 53 billion compared to 63 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” and a 900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility as discussed in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline distillate and crude oil prices at december 31 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006 

cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the lima refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash flows for each period presented cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was 260 million and 

215 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively cash used in investing activities related to the lima refinery was 14 million and 133 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2007 combined with 22 billion of proceeds from the issuance of longterm notes 24 billion of proceeds from the sale of our lima refinery a 311 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stockbased compensation cost and 159 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2006 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 63 billion compared to 59 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” partially offset by a 12 billion decrease from an unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a 10 billion increase in current income tax expense changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements the primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable working capital change in 2005 attributable to a 400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately 200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the premcor acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to higher prices for gasoline and crude oil at december 31 2006 compared to such prices at the end of 2005 

cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was 215 million and 121 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively cash used in investing activities related to the lima refinery was 133 million and 42 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2006 combined with 880 million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in nustar gp holdings llc a 206 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stockbased compensation cost and 122 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans were used mainly to 

 

 

 

capital investments 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we expended 23 billion for capital expenditures and 518 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2007 included 614 million of costs related to environmental projects in addition we expended 75 million for amounts due under contingent earnout agreements 

in connection with our acquisition of the st charles refinery in 2003 the seller was entitled to receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level see the discussion in note 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements in connection with the premcor acquisition we assumed premcor’s obligation under a contingent earnout agreement related to premcor’s acquisition of the delaware city refinery from motiva enterprises llc payments due under these earnout arrangements were limited based on annual and aggregate limits during 2007 we made earnout payments of 50 million related to the acquisition of the st charles refinery and 25 million related to the acquisition of the delaware city refinery the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement in january 2008 we made a 25 million earnout payment related to the st charles refinery which was the final payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement 

for 2008 we expect to incur approximately 45 billion for capital investments including approximately 41 billion for capital expenditures approximately 575 million of which is for environmental projects and approximately 400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

in may and june of 2007 we made cash capital contributions of 190 million and 25 million respectively to the cameron highway oil pipeline project representing our 50 portion of the amount required for the cameron highway oil pipeline joint venture to redeem its fixedrate notes and variablerate debt respectively our capital contributions along with equal capital contributions from the other 50 joint venture partner were used to redeem all of the joint venture’s outstanding debt 

lima refinery disposition 

effective july 1 2007 we sold our lima refinery to husky proceeds from the sale were approximately 24 billion including approximately 550 million from the sale of working capital to husky primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 827 million or 426 million after tax which is presented in “income from discontinued operations net of income tax expense” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2007 in connection with the sale we entered into a transition services agreement with husky under which we agreed to provide certain accounting and administrative services to husky with the services terminating by july 31 2008 a significant portion of these services has been transitioned to husky as of february 27 2008

in april 2007 we borrowed 3 billion under a 364day term credit agreement with a financial institution to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements in may 2007 we repaid 500 million of the borrowings under the 364day term credit agreement the remaining balance of 25 billion was repaid in june 2007 using available cash and proceeds from the issuance of 225 billion of notes as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2007 “current portion of longterm debt and capital lease obligations” as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of our 95 senior notes with a stated value of 350 million and a maturity date of february 2013 which were redeemed in february 2008 as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase as of december 31 2007 all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows 

 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment dock facilities transportation equipment and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases the operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in “other longterm liabilities” 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2007 our shortterm and longterm purchase obligations increased by 70 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2006 the increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at december 31 2007 compared to december 31 2006 

other longterm liabilities 

our “other longterm liabilities” are described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2007 

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2007 our committed lines of credit were as follows 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had 502 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted shortterm bank credit facilities 292 million of letters of credit outstanding under our committed revolving credit facility and cdn 11 million of letters of credit outstanding under our canadian committed revolving credit facility these letters of credit expire during 2008 and 2009 

stock purchase programs 

during the first quarter of 2007 we had two stock purchase programs that had been previously approved by our board of directors one program authorized our purchase of our common stock in open market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements and the other was a 2 billion common stock purchase program stock purchases under the programs are made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements subject to market conditions and other factors the programs do not have a scheduled expiration date 

on april 25 2007 our board of directors approved an amendment to our 2 billion common stock purchase program to increase the authorized purchases under the program to 6 billion in conjunction with the increase in our common stock purchase program we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase 3 billion of our shares under an accelerated share repurchase program and in late april 2007 421 million shares were purchased under this agreement the purchase of these shares was funded with a shortterm bridge loan which we subsequently replaced with longerterm financing as described in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements the cost of the shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program was to be adjusted with the final purchase cost based on a discount to the average trading price of our 

common stock weighted by the daily volume of shares traded during the program period any adjustment to the cost could be paid in cash or stock at our option 

the accelerated share repurchase program was completed on july 23 2007 and we elected to pay in cash an additional 94 million for the shares purchased this cash payment had a dilutive effect on our computation of earnings per common share from continuing operations assuming dilution for the year ended december 31 2007 see note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

during 2007 we purchased 705 million shares of our common stock for 49 billion under our 6 billion common stock purchase program including shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above and 138 million shares for 915 million in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans these purchases represented approximately 14 of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december 31 2006 during 2008 through february 22 we have purchased 49 million shares of our common stock for 317 million under our two stock purchase programs 

on february 28 2008 our board of directors approved a new 3 billion stock purchase program this program is in addition to the 6 billion program discussed above this new 3 billion program has no expiration date 

pension plan funded status 

during 2007 we contributed 143 million to our qualified pension plans based on a 600 discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2007 the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 120 of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2007 

although we have only 2 million of minimum required contributions to our qualified pension plans during 2008 under the employee retirement income security act we expect to use expected available cash to contribute approximately 100 million to our qualified plans during 2008 

environmental matters 

as discussed in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 

tax matters 

as discussed in note 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements we are subject to extensive tax liabilities new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties 

effective january 1 2007 the government of aruba goa enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in aruba the turnover tax which is 3 for onisland sales and services and 1 on export sales is being assessed by the goa on sales by our aruba refinery however due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our aruba refinery by the goa through december 31 2010 as well as other reasons we believe that exports by our aruba refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax no amounts have been accrued on exports with respect to this turnover tax we have commenced arbitration 

proceedings with the netherlands arbitration institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under the tax holiday we have also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in aruba 

other 

during the first quarter of 2007 our mckee refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit resulting in business interruption losses for which we have submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies in the fourth quarter of 2007 we received an immaterial initial payment from the insurance carriers on our claims the proceeds from which were recorded as a reduction to “cost of sales” no additional amount has been accrued related to these claims pending future settlements with the insurance carriers 

in november 2007 we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our aruba refinery in january 2008 we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our memphis and krotz springs refineries 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from the public and private capital markets and bank markets to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

accounts receivable sales facility 

as of december 31 2007 we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 1 billion of eligible trade receivables which matures in august 2008 we use this program as a source of working capital funding under this program one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables without recourse to the thirdparty financial institutions we remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program during the third quarter of 2007 we reduced the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty financial institutions by 900 million therefore as of december 31 2007 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty financial institutions was 100 million note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program 

termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet however as of december 31 2007 the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity particularly considering the reduction in the utilization of the program during 2007 as discussed above and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities we are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets excluding goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives equity method investments and deferred tax assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans however providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates 

environmental liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits 

additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 is included in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control for example the discount rate assumption is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65 equities and 35 bonds which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2007 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2008 in millions 

 

tax liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes we are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad 

valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time in addition we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes 

legal liabilities 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges the carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was 39 billion and 37 billion as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and the fair value of such inventories was 101 billion and 66 billion as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively from time to time we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases cash flow hedges we also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales finally we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of 

market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes see “derivative instruments” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions 

the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors 

the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including 

 

 

 

the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument if any is recognized in income as incurred for our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income 

the following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in “accumulated other comprehensive income” pending consummation of the forecasted transactions 

contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the weightedaverage pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million british thermal units for natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements for futures the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume while the market value amount represents the periodend market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume the pretax fair value for futures swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract the pretax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes for futures and options the pretax fair value represents i the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions or ii the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions additionally for futures and options the weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weightedaverage receive price represents the contract price for short positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for options represents their strike price 

 

 

interest rate risk 

in general our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixedrate and floatingrate debt in addition we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense the recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and longterm debt balances are adjusted accordingly we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2007 and 2006 

the following table provides information about our longterm debt instruments dollars in millions the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

we enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge 

as of december 31 2007 we had commitments to purchase 507 million of us dollars our market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 29 2008 resulting in a 2008 loss of 2 million

valero’s operations 

refining 

on december 31 2006 our refining operations included 18 refineries in the united states canada and aruba with a combined total throughput capacity of approximately 33 million barrels per day bpd the following table presents the locations of these refineries and their feedstock throughput capacities these capacities exclude any throughput enhancements completed after december 31 2006 

 

   we process a wide slate of feedstocks including sour crude oils intermediates and residual fuel oil resid which can typically be purchased at differentials below west texas intermediate a benchmark crude oil in 2006 sour crude oils acidic sweet crude oils and resid represented 55 of our throughput volumes sweet crude oils represented 30 and the remaining 15 was composed of blendstocks and other feedstocks our ability to process significant amounts of sour crude oils enhances our competitive position in the industry relative to refiners that process primarily sweet crude oils because sour crude oils typically can be purchased at differentials below sweet crude oils 

  

in 2006 gasolines and blendstocks represented 48 of our refined product slate distillates – such as home heating oil diesel fuel and jet fuel – represented 32 petrochemicals represented 3 and asphalt lubricants gas oils no 6 fuel oil petroleum coke and other products comprised the remaining 17

f eedstock s upply 

approximately 65 of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market our term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at marketrelated prices directly or indirectly from various foreign national oil companies including feedstocks originating in saudi arabia mexico iraq kuwait venezuela colombia and africa as well as international and domestic oil companies about 75 of these crude oil feedstocks are imported from foreign sources and about 25 are domestic in the event we become unable to purchase crude oil from any one of these sources we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available 

the us network of crude oil pipelines and terminals allows us to acquire crude oil from producing leases domestic crude oil trading centers and ships delivering cargoes of foreign and domestic crude oil our quebec city and aruba refineries rely on foreign crude oil that is delivered to the refineries’ dock facilities by ship we use the futures market to manage a portion of the price risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of our delivery date and holding inventories of crude oils and refined products 

r efining s egment s ales

 risk factors 

our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins 

our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship or margin between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon numerous factors beyond our control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined products these in turn are dependent upon among other things the availability and quantity of imports the production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers levels of refined product inventories us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation 

historically refining margins have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future earnings on a diluted basis for 2004 2005 and 2006 were 327 per share 610 per share and 864 per share respectively refining margins were a significant contributing factor to the increase in our earnings between 2004 and 2006 the increase in our earnings for these periods is more fully described in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance 

the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change  eg  california’s ab32 “global warming solutions act” the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 

disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations 

a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in saudi arabia mexico iraq kuwait venezuela colombia and africa we are therefore subject to the political geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in and supplies originating from those areas if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices our results of operations could be materially adversely affected including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs 

  

competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 

the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets we compete with numerous other companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks many of our competitors however obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from companyowned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets and greater brandname recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 

some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry in addition we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial commercial and individual consumers 

a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business 

our refineries are our principal operating assets as a result our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident be damaged by severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster such as an act of terrorism or otherwise be forced to shut down if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected to the extent not recoverable through insurance because of lost production and repair costs 

our operations expose us to many operating risks not all of which are insured 

our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry including explosions fires toxic emissions maritime hazards and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas they are also subject to the additional hazards of loss from severe weather conditions as protection against operating hazards we maintain insurance coverage against some but not all such potential losses we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates as a result of market conditions premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage for example insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future certain of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties

overview 

the strong industry fundamentals we experienced throughout 2005 continued during 2006 resulting in the highest net income in our history of 55 billion 52 higher than the net income reported in 2005 our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil referred to as the “refined product margin” refined product margins for the year 2006 both for gasoline and distillates were comparable to the strong margins realized in 2005 heavy industrywide turnaround activity the implementation of more restrictive sulfur regulations on gasoline and diesel increased use of ethanol and decreased use of mtbe in the reformulated gasoline pool and limited capacity expansions due to the high cost of compliance with environmental regulations resulted in tighter supplies of refined products and strong margins during most of 2006 since approximately 60 of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices referred to as the “sour crude oil differential” sour crude oil differentials for 2006 were also about as wide as the very favorable differentials experienced in 2005 in addition to these continuing strong industry fundamentals we benefited significantly from the addition of the four former premcor refineries which generated 25 billion of operating income or 31 of our total operating income of 80 billion with average throughput volumes of 792000 barrels per day during 2006 

in addition to the operating income effects discussed above we monetized our entire ownership interest in valero lp by selling all of our units in valero gp holdings llc during 2006 generating proceeds of 880 million and recognizing a pretax gain of 328 million this sale along with our favorable operating results resulted in a strong balance sheet as of december 31 2006 we reduced debt by 245 million during 2006 and increased our cash balance to 16 billion at yearend while at the same time purchasing 20 billion or approximately 5 of our outstanding shares

   general 

operating revenues increased 12 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from the former premcor refinery operations operating income and net income for the year ended december 31 2006 increased significantly compared to the year ended december 31 2005 operating income increased 26 billion or 47 from 2005 to 2006 due to a 26 billion increase in the refining segment and a 28 million increase in the retail segment partially offset by a 47 million increase in general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment increased from 59 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 to 85 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 resulting from a 19 increase in throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of 115 per barrel or 10 partially offset by increased refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of 12 billion in addition the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a 621 million pretax lifo charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the premcor acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying valero’s lifo accounting policy 

the change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following factors 

 

  

  

  

   

 refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense were 32 higher for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 due primarily to the premcor acquisition on september 1 2005 excluding the effect of the premcor acquisition operating expenses increased 5 due mainly to increases in maintenance expense employee compensation and related benefits outside services and catalyst and chemicals partially offset by reduced energy costs refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 42 from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the premcor acquisition the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail operating income was 182 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 154 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this 18 increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased instore sales in the us system partially offset by higher selling expenses due mainly to an increase in credit card processing fees 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 47 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits stockbased compensation expense environmental expenses and charitable contributions as well as the favorable resolution of a california excise tax dispute in 2005 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses attributable to premcor headquarters personnel 

“other income net” for the year ended december 31 2006 includes a pretax gain of 328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in valero gp holdings llc in 2006 as discussed in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the premcor acquisition partially offset by a reduction in other debt outstanding capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects including projects at the four former premcor refineries 

income tax expense increased 10 billion from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55 increase in income before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 increased from the year ended december 31 2005 as a lower percentage of our pretax income was contributed by the aruba refinery the profits of which are nontaxable in aruba through december 31 2010 this increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the effects of new tax legislation in both texas and canada in 2006

      general 

operating revenues increased 50 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of significantly higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations operating income and net income for the year ended december 31 2005 increased significantly compared to the year ended december 31 2004 operating income increased 25 billion or 83 from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to a 26 billion increase in the refining segment partially offset by a 30 million decrease in the retail segment and a 123 million increase in general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment increased from 33 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 to 59 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 resulting mainly from an increase in refining throughput margin of 370 per barrel or 50 and a 15 increase in throughput volumes partially offset by an increase in refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of 977 million and the 2005 lifo charge discussed in the “2006 compared to 2005 results of operations” 

refining throughput margin for 2005 increased primarily due to the following factors 

 

  

   

 the above increases in throughput margin for 2005 were partially offset by the effects of 

 

  

 refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense were 37 higher for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 due mainly to 420 million of expenses related to the refineries acquired in the premcor acquisition a full year of operations of the aruba refinery and increases in energy costs employee compensation expense and maintenance expense refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 39 from 2004 to 2005 due mainly to depreciation expense resulting from the premcor acquisition on september 1 2005 implementation of new capital projects increased turnaround and catalyst amortization a 15 million gain in 2004 on the sale of certain property discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements and the writeoff of costs in 2005 resulting from the decision to convert wholesale sites marketing under the diamond shamrock brand to the valero brand 

retail 

retail operating income was 154 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 184 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 16 between the periods the decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses in the us and canada as higher retail fuel prices resulted in higher credit card processing fees in addition canada’s selling expenses increased 15 million due to an increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 123 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits the recognition of increased variable compensation expense resulting in large part from a significant increase in our common stock price during 2005 and expenses attributable to premcor headquarters personnel these increases were partially offset by the successful resolution in the first quarter of 2005 of a california excise tax dispute 

“other income expense net” improved 101 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to the combined effect of a 55 million gain realized on the sale of our equity interests in javelina company and javelina pipeline company in november 2005 and a 2004 impairment charge of 57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp this combined effect as well as an increase in bank interest income due to higher cash balances was partially offset by our 50 interest in certain debt refinancing costs incurred in 2005 by the cameron highway oil pipeline joint venture and increased costs related to our accounts receivable sales program 

  

interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2004 to 2005 due to interest incurred in 2005 on the debt resulting from the premcor acquisition capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects including projects at the four former premcor refineries 

income tax expense increased 791 million from 2004 to 2005 mainly as a result of a 95 increase in income before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2005 however decreased from the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of a change in permanent booktotax differences which included a deduction from income in 2005 for qualified domestic manufacturing activities as allowed under the american jobs creation act of 2004 

outlook 

in january 2007 we saw industry fundamentals for refined products remain consistent with what we experienced at the end of 2006 the gulf coast gasoline margin for january 2007 was 462 per barrel while the west coast gasoline margin averaged 2034 per barrel regarding distillates the gulf coast onroad diesel margin was 1300 per barrel and the west coast onroad diesel margin was 2894 per barrel 

our outlook for gasoline margins is positive gasoline supplies are expected to tighten as spring maintenance activity gets underway in addition the industry will soon be making the transition from wintergrade gasoline specifications to summergrade specifications which generally leads to declines in inventories and higher margins as we head toward the summer driving season while these factors are expected to reduce supplies gasoline demand is expected to remain positive this year as a result of lower pump prices and a continuing strong economy this positive demand trend combined with the expected pressure on supplies should create a tightening of the supplydemand balance 

the outlook for lowsulfur distillate margins is also favorable as onroad diesel demand continues to be strong currently approximately 80 of our us onroad distillate production is ultralowsulfur diesel ulsd and we are on schedule to meet the epa’s phasein requirements for ulsd by the end of the transition period in june 2007 in addition specifications requiring a reduction in the amount of sulfur in offroad diesel excluding marine and railroad uses go into effect in june of this year which may further tighten supplies as a result we expect the favorable spread between onroad and offroad diesel prices to continue 

sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable for the foreseeable future persistently weak residual fuel oil prices support wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for a portion of their sour crude oil purchases if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to process than crude oil in addition the flexibility of many of our refineries to process alternative sour crude oils allows us to continue to find attractively priced feedstocks 

operationally during 2007 we expect to benefit from our recently completed port arthur crude unit expansion which allows us to process up to 325000 barrels per day of sour crude oil at that refinery 

on february 16 2007 our mckee refinery experienced a fire in its propane deasphalting unit as of the filing of this annual report the entire mckee refinery remains shut down while efforts are underway to determine the cause of the accident assess damages and establish a plan for making repairs full scale efforts to assess damages make repairs and restart the refinery are underway though we do not yet have a firm estimated date for commencement of operations although we are in the preliminary stages of assessing the extent of damages we do not believe that this incident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the first quarter of 2007 

  

overall we believe that we are wellpositioned to capitalize on the expected continuing positive industry fundamentals during 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2006 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 63 billion compared to 59 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” partially offset by a 12 billion decrease from an unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a 10 billion increase in current income tax expense changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 are shown in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements the primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable working capital change in 2005 attributable to the factors discussed below in “cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005” both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to price increases for gasoline and crude oil 

the net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2006 combined with 880 million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in valero gp holdings llc a 206 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stockbased compensation cost and 122 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans were used mainly to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 59 billion compared to 30 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 29 billion the increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” and an 879 million increase from favorable working capital changes between the years as reflected in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 working capital was positively impacted by a 400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately 200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the premcor acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose both receivables and accounts payable increased significantly due to commodity price increases from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 

the net cash generated from operating activities during 2005 combined with 428 million of available cash on hand 182 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans 78 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in the javelina joint venture 45 million of proceeds from the sale of the denver refinery and a 38 million net return of investment from the cameron highway oil pipeline joint venture resulting mainly from the refinancing of the joint venture’s debt in june 2005 were used mainly to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 capital investments 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we expended 32 billion for capital expenditures and 569 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2006 included approximately 16 billion of costs related to environmental projects in addition we expended 101 million for amounts due under contingent earnout agreements 

in connection with our acquisitions of basis petroleum inc in 1997 and the st charles refinery in 2003 the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years respectively following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level see the discussion in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements in connection with the premcor acquisition we assumed premcor’s obligation under a contingent earnout agreement related to premcor’s acquisition of the delaware city refinery from motiva enterprises llc motiva under this agreement motiva was entitled to receive two separate annual earnout contingency payments depending on a the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through may 2007 and b the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through may 2006 the earnout contingency related to the gasification facility expired in 2006 with no payment required payments due under all of these earnout arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits during 2006 we made earnout payments of 26 million the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement related to the acquisition of basis petroleum inc 50 million related to the acquisition of the st charles refinery and 25 million related to the acquisition of the delaware city refinery in january 2007 we made an earnout payment of 50 million related to the st charles refinery based on estimated margin levels through april 2007 earnout payments of 25 million the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement related to the acquisition of the delaware city refinery would be due in the second quarter of 2007 

for 2007 we expect to incur approximately 35 billion for capital investments including approximately 31 billion for capital expenditures approximately 800 million of which is for environmental projects and approximately 400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earnout agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 are summarized below in millions 

 

   

longterm debt 

payments for longterm debt are at stated values 

during march 2006 we made a scheduled debt repayment of 220 million related to our 7375 notes in addition during 2006 we made debt payments of 29 million related to various notes as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2006 “current portion of longterm debt and capital lease obligations” as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included mainly 230 million of notes which become due in april 2007 and 50 million of notes which become due in november 2007 as well as 175 million of notes with a maturity date of february 2010 which were redeemed in february 2007 as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase as of december 31 2006 all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above “investment grade” level as follows 

 

 operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment dock facilities transportation equipment and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities feedstock and storage to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2006 our shortterm and longterm purchase obligations decreased by approximately 20 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2005 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in obligations under crude oil supply contracts partially offset by new contracts in 2006 we have not made in the past nor do we expect to make in the future payments for feedstock or services that we have not received or will not receive nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions 

  

other longterm liabilities 

our “other longterm liabilities” are described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for most of these liabilities the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of december 31 2006 however certain expected payments related to our anticipated pension contribution in 2007 and our other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements for purposes of reflecting amounts for other longterm liabilities in the table above we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31 2006 

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2006 our committed lines of credit were as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2006 we had 343 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted shortterm bank credit facilities cdn 85 million of letters of credit outstanding under our canadian committed revolving credit facility and 245 million of letters of credit outstanding under our committed revolving credit facility these letters of credit expire during 2007 2008 and 2009 

stock purchase programs 

our board of directors has approved our purchase of treasury stock in open market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements as well as purchases under our publicly announced stock purchase programs under these authorizations we purchased approximately 5 of our outstanding shares during 2006 we purchased 289 million shares for 16 billion related to our employee benefit plans and 57 million shares for 361 million under our former stock purchase program 

on october 19 2006 our board of directors approved a new 2 billion common stock purchase program this new authorization is in addition to our existing authorization for employee benefit plan requirements stock purchases under this program will be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and are subject to market conditions and other factors the program does not have a scheduled expiration date during 2006 we purchased no shares under our new 2 billion stock purchase program 

sale of investment in valero gp holdings llc 

on july 19 2006 valero gp holdings llc consummated an initial public offering ipo of 17250000 of its units representing limited liability company interests to the public at 2200 per unit before an underwriters’ discount of 1265 per unit on december 22 2006 valero gp holdings llc completed a secondary public offering of 20550000 units representing limited liability company interests at a price of 2162 per unit before an underwriters’ discount of 08648 per unit in addition 4700000 unregistered units of valero gp holdings llc were sold to its chairman of the board of directors who was at that time also chairman of valero’s board of directors at 2162 per unit all such units were sold by our subsidiaries that held various ownership interests in valero gp holdings llc as a result valero gp holdings llc did not receive any proceeds from these offerings and our indirect ownership interest in valero gp holdings llc was reduced to zero 

proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the ipo totaled approximately 355 million net of the underwriters’ discount and other offering expenses which resulted in a pretax gain to us of 132 million on the sale of the units proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the secondary offering and private sale of units totaled 

  

approximately 525 million net of the underwriters’ discount and other offering expenses which resulted in an additional pretax gain to us of 196 million the total pretax gain of 328 million is included in “other income expense net” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2006 the funds received from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes 

pension plan funded status 

during 2006 we contributed 343 million to our qualified pension plans based on a 575 discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2006 the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 104 of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2006 

although we have no expected minimum required contribution to our qualified pension plans during 2007 under the employee retirement income security act we expect to contribute approximately 100 million to our qualified plans during 2007 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations for additional information regarding our environmental matters see note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

tax matters 

we are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future for example effective january 1 2007 the government of aruba goa enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in aruba the turnover tax which is 3 for onisland sales and services and 1 on export sales is being assessed by the goa on sales by our aruba refinery however due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our aruba refinery by the goa through december 31 2010 we believe that sales by our aruba refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax we have filed a request for arbitration with the netherlands arbitration institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under this tax holiday 

other 

during the third quarter of 2005 certain of our refineries experienced property damage and business interruption losses associated with hurricanes katrina and rita as a result of these losses we submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies as of december 31 2006 we have recorded a receivable related to our property damage claims which was recorded as a reduction of repair and maintenance expense no amounts related to the potential business interruption insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 as we had not reached a final settlement with the insurance carriers during 2006 we reached a final business interruption settlement with our insurance carriers the proceeds from which were recorded as a reduction to “cost of sales” amounts received or to be received for these matters are immaterial to our results of operations and financial position 

on february 1 2007 we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives for our lima refinery which we acquired in the premcor acquisition 

  

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from the public and private capital markets and bank markets to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

accounts receivable sales facility 

as of december 31 2006 we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 1 billion of eligible trade receivables which matures in august 2008 we use this program as a source of working capital funding under this program one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables without recourse to the thirdparty financial institutions we remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program as of december 31 2006 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty financial institutions was 1 billion note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program 

termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet however as of december 31 2006 the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities we are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had nor is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets excluding goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives equity method investments and deferred tax assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset its estimated remaining life and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans however providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates we recognized an impairment charge of 57 million in 2004 related to our equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp as discussed in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as our own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the 

  

determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 is included in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65 equities and 35 bonds which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2006 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2007 in millions 

 

 tax liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities including federal state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise salesuse payroll franchise withholding and ad valorem taxes new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time in addition we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts 

we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations a contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable the recording of our tax 

  

liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due in addition in determining our income tax provision we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be recovered through future taxable income significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance if any that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change the valuation allowance may need to be revised however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved the various potential interpretations of the tax laws and the wide range of possible outcomes 

legal liabilities 

a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages however an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges the carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was 42 billion and 38 billion as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and the fair value of such inventories was 71 billion as of both december 31 2006 and 2005 from time to time we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases cash flow hedges we also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales finally we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes see “derivative instruments” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions 

the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors 

  

the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2006 and 2005 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of “other comprehensive income” and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument if any is recognized in income as incurred for our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income 

the following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in “accumulated other comprehensive income” pending consummation of the forecasted transactions 

contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the weightedaverage pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million british thermal units for natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements for futures the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume while the market value amount represents the periodend market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume the pretax fair value for futures swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract the pretax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes for futures and options the pretax fair value represents i the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions or ii the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions additionally for futures and options the weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weightedaverage receive price represents the contract price for short positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for options represents their strike price 

  

   

   

interest rate risk 

our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt in addition we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged is recorded in interest expense the recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and longterm debt balances are adjusted accordingly 

the following table provides information about our longterm debt and interest rate derivative instruments dollars in millions all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented for interest rate swaps the table presents notional amounts and weightedaverage interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract weightedaverage floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 

 

  

 on may 1 2006 we terminated the 875 million of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at that date for a payment of 54 million substantially all of this payment was deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments that were being hedged 

  

foreign currency risk 

we enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge 

as of december 31 2006 we had commitments to purchase 290 million of us dollars our market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 19 2007 resulting in a 2007 gain of 4 million

overview 

as of december 31 2005 we owned and operated 18 refineries in the united states canada and aruba with a combined throughput capacity including crude oil and other feedstocks of approximately 33 million barrels per day 

we market refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a network of approximately 5000 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the united states canada and aruba under various brand names including primarily valero â  diamond shamrock â  shamrock â  ultramar â and beacon â  during the second quarter of 2005 we announced our plan to retire the diamond shamrock brand and convert those us retail and wholesale sites to the valero brand this program is progressing well with 385 sites having been converted to the valero brand by the end of 2005 and 894 sites remaining to be rebranded during 2006 and early 2007

general 

operating revenues increased 50 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of significantly higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations operating income and net income for the year ended december 31 2005 increased significantly compared to the year ended december 31 2004 operating income increased 25 billion or 83 from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to a 26 billion increase in the refining segment partially offset by a 34 million decrease in the retail segment and a 107 million increase in general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment increased from 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 to 58 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 resulting mainly from an increase in refining throughput margin of 370 per barrel or 50 and a 15 increase in throughput volumes partially offset by an increase in refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of 989 million 

refining total throughput margin for 2005 increased primarily due to the following factors 

 

the above increases in throughput margin for 2005 were partially offset by the effects of 

 

 

 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense were 37 higher for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 due mainly to 420 million of expenses related to the refineries acquired in the premcor acquisition a full year of operations of the aruba refinery and increases in energy costs employee compensation expense and maintenance expense refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 39 from 2004 to 2005 due mainly to depreciation expense resulting from the premcor acquisition on september 1 2005 implementation of new capital projects increased turnaround and catalyst amortization a 15 million gain in 2004 on the sale of certain property discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements and the writeoff of costs in 2005 resulting from the decision to convert wholesale sites marketing under the diamond shamrock brand to the valero brand 

retail 

retail operating income was 141 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 175 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 19 between the periods the decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses in the us and northeast as higher retail fuel prices resulted in higher credit card processing fees in addition northeast selling expenses increased 15 million due to an increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 107 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits these increases were mainly related to the recognition of increased variable compensation expense resulting in large part from a significant increase in our common stock price during 2005 and expenses attributable to premcor headquarters personnel these increases were partially offset by the successful resolution in the first quarter of 2005 of a california excise tax dispute 

“other income expense net” improved 101 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to the combined effect of a 55 million gain realized on the sale of our equity interests in javelina company and javelina pipeline company in november 2005 and a 2004 impairment charge of 57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp this combined effect as well as an increase in bank interest income due to higher cash balances was partially offset by our 50 interest in certain debt refinancing costs incurred in 2005 by the cameron highway oil pipeline joint venture and increased costs related to our accounts receivable sales program 

interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2004 to 2005 due to interest incurred in 2005 on the debt resulting from the premcor acquisition however the increased interest incurred was almost entirely offset by increased capitalized interest due to an increase in capital projects including those at the four former premcor refineries 

income tax expense increased 791 million from 2004 to 2005 mainly as a result of a 95 increase in income before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2005 however decreased from the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of a change in permanent booktotax differences

general 

operating revenues increased 44 from the year ended december 31 2003 to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations the increases in operating income from 12 billion for 2003 to 30 billion for 2004 and net income from 622 million for 2003 to 18 billion for 2004 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for our refining segment as discussed below 

refining 

operating income for our refining segment was 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 19 billion from the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45 increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and an 18 increase in refining throughput volumes partially offset by a 586 million increase in refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense 

refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors 

 

the above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of 

 

 

refining operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense were 29 higher for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the st charles refinery in july 2003 and the aruba refinery in march 2004 higher energy costs primarily related to an increase in natural gas prices increased maintenance expense an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation and increases in insurance expense injected catalyst professional fees and regulatory costs although total refining operating expenses increased 29 from 2003 to 2004 this increase was 9 on a perbarrel basis the lower percentage increase on a perbarrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the st charles and aruba acquisitions refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24 from the year ended december 31 2003 to the year ended december 31 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new capital projects the acquisitions of the st charles and aruba refineries and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 

retail 

retail operating income was 175 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 37 million from the year ended december 31 2003 retail fuel margins in the united states decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to the consumer and fuel sales declined in the united states due to fewer stores retail depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations in the northeast operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a significant increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004 

corporate expenses and other 

general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 68 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 41 million from 2003 to 2004 including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately 21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective years the remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions 

equity in earnings of valero lp represents our equity interest in the earnings of valero lp after march 18 2003 on march 18 2003 our ownership interest in valero lp decreased from 736 to 495 as a result of this decrease in ownership of valero lp combined with certain other partnership governance changes we ceased consolidating valero lp as of that date and began using the equity method to account for our investment in valero lp the minority interest in net income of valero lp represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of valero lp during the periods that we consolidated such operations 

“other income expense net” for the year ended december 31 2004 includes an impairment charge of 57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp as further described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding the effect of this impairment charge other income declined 6 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a 17 million gain recognized in 2003 related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the golden eagle business described further in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements partially offset by a 10 million increase in equity income in 2004 from the javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices 

distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption of the 832 trust originated preferred securities toprs in june 2003 and the settlement of the premium equity participating security units peps units in august 2003 

income tax expense increased 541 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175 increase in income before income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2004 however decreased from the year ended december 31 2003 due mainly to income contributed by the aruba refinery in 2004 the operations of which are nontaxable in aruba through december 31 2010 

outlook 

in january 2006 we saw a continuation of the positive refining industry fundamentals that we experienced in 2005 refined product margins for january 2006 were well above historical fiveyear averages for example the gulf coast gasoline margin for january 2006 was 666 per barrel compared to the historical january average for the last five years of 518 per barrel while the gulf coast distillate margin was 784 per barrel 323 per barrel above the historical january average for the last five years of 461 per barrel despite a drop in refined product margins in february due primarily to an unusually warm winter and record imports of wintergrade gasolines we expect these strong fundamentals to remain in place throughout 2006 

our outlook for gasoline margins is positive as we expect demand for gasoline during 2006 to remain strong due to continuing strong economic activity in the united states and abroad we expect that the supply required to satisfy the high demand will be tight for several reasons first gasoline inventories in early 2006 on a daysofsupply basis have been low for this time of year second a very high level of turnaround activity is projected for the first half of 2006 for the us refining industry which should reduce gasoline production third the industry’s typical switch to summergrade gasoline in early march will be complicated this year by the lower sulfurcontent specifications that have taken effect fourth the effective elimination by congress of mtbe in the gasoline pool by early in the second quarter of 2006 is expected to result in a loss of gasoline production that will have to be made up through increased imports or the blending of highercost blendstocks either of which will require higher margins to attract the necessary supply and finally a limited amount of new refining capacity in the us is expected to come online in 2006 

the outlook for lowsulfur distillate margins is also favorable inventories of onroad diesel on a daysofsupply basis are near historical fiveyear lows we expect that supplies of onroad diesel will remain tight throughout 2006 as demand is expected to exceed production capacity particularly in light of the epa’s tightening diesel fuel specifications that take effect on june 1 2006 

sour crude oil discounts are also expected to remain wide for the foreseeable future the combination of high refined product margins and the new lowsulfur specifications for refined products has resulted in increased demand for sweet crude oil versus sour crude oil due to its higher yield of light products and lower sulfur content higher utilization rates globally by certain less complex refineries have also resulted in the production of more residual fuel oil the increased supply of resid supports wider discounts for heavy sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute resid for a portion of their heavy sour crude oil purchases if resid becomes more economic to process than crude oil 

overall we believe that we are wellpositioned to capitalize on the expected continuing positive industry fundamentals and our resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts during 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 58 billion compared to 30 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 28 billion the increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under “results of operations” and an 879 million increase from favorable working capital changes between the years as reflected in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 working capital was positively impacted by a 400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately 200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the premcor acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose both receivables and accounts payable increased significantly due to commodity price increases from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 

the net cash generated from operating activities during 2005 combined with 15 billion of proceeds from debt borrowings 428 million of available cash on hand 227 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our benefit plans 78 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in the javelina joint venture and 45 million of proceeds from the sale of the denver refinery and a 38 million net return of investment from the cameron highway oil pipeline joint venture resulting mainly from the refinancing of the joint venture’s debt in june 2005 were used mainly to 

 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2004 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 30 billion compared to 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 12 billion the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income in 2004 as described above under “results of operations” partially offset by a 226 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years as reflected in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 working capital requirements decreased by 203 million compared to a 429 million decrease for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease for 2004 was largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities while 2003 benefited primarily from a 350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program 

in addition to the 30 billion of net cash provided by operating activities we generated cash from various other sources during 2004 including proceeds of 406 million from the sale of common stock 135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our benefit plans 108 million of proceeds from dispositions of property plant and equipment and 64 million of net borrowings borrowings net of debt repayments we used these proceeds to 

 

 

capital investments 

on september 1 2005 we completed our merger with premcor we paid the 34 billion cash portion of the merger consideration from available cash and proceeds from a 15 billion fiveyear bank term loan due in august 2010 see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the 15 billion term loan in addition we assumed premcor’s existing debt which had a fair value of 19 billion as of september 1 2005 

during the year ended december 31 2005 we incurred 21 billion for capital expenditures and 441 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2005 included approximately 11 billion of costs related to environmental projects in addition 85 million of contingent earnout payments were made 62 million was expended for minor acquisitions 29 million was contributed to valero lp in conjunction with its acquisition of kaneb pipe line partners lp kaneb partners and kaneb services llc together the kaneb acquisition to maintain our 2 general partner interest in valero lp and 20 million was expended on the conversion of us retail and wholesale sites from the diamond shamrock brand to the valero brand with approximately 45 million of additional spending anticipated during 2006 and early 2007 on this program 

in connection with our acquisitions of basis petroleum inc in 1997 and the st charles refinery in 2003 the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years respectively following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level see the discussion in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements in connection with the premcor acquisition we assumed premcor’s obligation under an earnout contingency agreement related to premcor’s acquisition of the delaware city refinery from motiva enterprises llc motiva under this agreement motiva is entitled to receive two separate annual earnout contingency payments depending on a the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through may 2007 and b the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through may 2006 any payments due under all of these earnout arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits during 2005 we made earnout payments of 50 million related to the acquisition of the st charles refinery and 35 million related to the basis petroleum acquisition in january 2006 we made an earnout payment of 50 million related to the st charles acquisition based on estimated margin levels through april 2006 earnout payments of 26 million maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement related to the basis petroleum acquisition and 25 million related to the acquisition of the delaware city refinery would be due in the second quarter of 2006 

for 2006 we expect to incur approximately 34 billion for capital investments including approximately 30 billion for capital expenditures approximately 13 billion of which is for environmental projects and approximately 400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs the capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earnout agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 are summarized below in millions 

 

longterm debt 

payments for longterm debt are at stated values 

in conjunction with the premcor acquisition we assumed debt with a fair value of 19 billion and 14 million of capital lease obligations in august 2005 we entered into a 15 billion term bank loan to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the premcor acquisition which was fully repaid by december 31 2005 

during january 2005 we repurchased 40 million of our 7375 notes due in march 2006 and 42 million of our 6125 notes due in april 2007 at a premium of 4 million in addition during 2005 we made scheduled debt repayments of 410 million related to various notes as discussed in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements during september 2005 we repurchased 190 million of the 775 senior subordinated notes assumed in the premcor acquisition we also repurchased the 125 senior notes assumed in the premcor acquisition for 182 million in october 2005 and the ohio water development authority environmental facilities revenue bonds for 10 million in november 2005 

as of december 31 2005 “current portion of longterm debt and capital lease obligations” included mainly 220 million of notes which become due in the first quarter of 2006 

our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase following the completion of the premcor acquisition standard  poor’s ratings services affirmed its rating of our senior unsecured debt of bbb minus and recently changed our outlook from negative to stable while moody’s investors service affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of baa3 with a stable outlook in february 2006 fitch ratings upgraded its rating of our senior unsecured debt to bbb with a stable outlook 

operating lease obligations 

our operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment dock facilities transportation equipment and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 

purchase obligations 

a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply 

arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities feedstock and storage to operate our refineries substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on our usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on a fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and b fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions as of december 31 2005 our shortterm and longterm purchase obligations increased by approximately 191 billion from the amount reported as of december 31 2004 the increase is primarily attributable to purchase obligations arising from the premcor acquisition totaling approximately 130 billion and an increase in obligations under crude oil supply contracts resulting from significantly higher crude oil prices as of december 31 2005 and new contracts in 2005 we have not made in the past nor do we expect to make in the future payments for feedstock or services that we have not received or will not receive nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions 

other longterm liabilities 

our “other longterm liabilities” are described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for most of these liabilities the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of december 31 2005 however certain expected payments related to our anticipated pension contribution in 2006 and our other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in note 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

other commercial commitments 

as of december 31 2005 our committed lines of credit were as follows 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had 232 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted shortterm bank credit facilities cdn 8 million of letters of credit outstanding under our canadian committed revolving credit facility and 254 million of letters of credit outstanding under our 5year committed revolving credit facility all of these letters of credit expire during 2006 

under our revolving bank credit facility’s definitions our debttocapitalization ratio net of cash was 248 as of december 31 2005 compared to 307 as of december 31 2004 

equity 

on september 1 2005 we issued 85 million shares of common stock as partial consideration for the premcor acquisition the common stock issued was recorded at a price of 3741 per share representing the average price of our common stock from two days before to two days after the announcement of the premcor acquisition in april 2005 resulting in an aggregate recorded amount of 32 billion for the common stock issued in addition we issued stock options with a fair value of 595 million 

we purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions to meet our obligations under employee benefit plans we also purchase shares of our common stock from our employees and nonemployee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options the vesting of restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions during 2005 we expended 571 million for the purchase of 13 million shares of our common stock under these programs through february 24 2006 we have purchased in the open market an additional 

37 million common shares at a cost of 199 million no shares were purchased during 2005 or through february 24 2006 under our 400 million stock repurchase program that was publicly announced on december 3 2001 

pension plan funded status 

during 2005 we contributed 61 million to our qualified pension plans based on a 55 discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2005 the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans were equal to approximately 76 of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2005 however the qualified pension plans were more than 90 funded based on their “current liability” which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations 

although our expected minimum required contribution to our qualified pension plans during 2006 is less than 5 million under the employee retirement income security act we expect to contribute approximately 65 million to our qualified pension plans during 2006 including the former premcor qualified pension plans discussed below during january 2006 we contributed 15 million to our qualified pension plans 

in connection with the premcor acquisition we became the plan sponsor for two additional qualified pension plans prior to september 1 2005 premcor had contributed 20 million to these plans during 2005 we made no further contributions to these plans in 2005 

environmental matters 

we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations for additional information regarding our environmental matters see note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

other 

during the third quarter of 2005 certain of our refineries experienced business interruption losses associated with hurricanes katrina and rita as a result of these losses we have submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies no amounts related to these potential business interruption insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 

our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable 

we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from the public and private capital markets and bank markets to fund our ongoing operating requirements we expect that to the extent necessary we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings under an existing shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the sec in august 2004 we have 35 billion of securities registered for potential future issuance however there can be no assurances

regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us 

as of june 30 2005 we owned 455 of the outstanding units including the 2 general partner interest of valero lp a limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined product pipeline terminalling and storage tank assets on july 1 2005 our ownership interest decreased to 234 as a result of the completion of the kaneb acquisition by valero lp historically valero lp has issued common units to the public which have resulted in increases in our proportionate share of valero lp’s capital because the issuance price per unit exceeded our carrying amount per unit at the time of issuance these increases in our investment in valero lp however have not been recognized in our consolidated financial statements through december 31 2005 and we are not permitted to do so until valero lp’s subordinated units that we own convert to common units which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2006 see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the amounts that will be recognized either in income or directly as a credit to equity upon the conversion of the subordinated units to common units subsequent to the conversion of the subordinated units any credits or charges generated upon the issuance of new units to the public by valero lp will be recognized immediately by us either in income or directly in equity depending on the accounting policy we adopt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

accounts receivable sales facility 

as of december 31 2005 we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of thirdparty financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to 1 billion of eligible trade receivables which matures in august 2008 we use this program as a source of working capital funding under this program one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables without recourse to the thirdparty financial institutions we remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program as of december 31 2005 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty financial institutions was 1 billion note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program 

termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet however as of december 31 2005 the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities we are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had or is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable 

impairment of assets 

longlived assets excluding goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives equity method investments and deferred tax assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount a loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount 

in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset estimated remaining life of the asset and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting our earnings our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans however providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates we recognized an impairment charge of 57 million in 2004 related to our equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp as discussed in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements and an impairment charge of 26 million in 2003 related to our former headquarters buildings as discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental liabilities 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as our own 

internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 

the balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is included in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures 

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control for example the discount rate assumption is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65 equities and 35 bonds which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2005 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2006 in millions 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges the carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was 38 billion and 21 billion as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively and the fair value of such inventories was 71 billion and 33 billion as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively we also from time to time use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases cash flow hedges we use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales finally we use derivative commodity instruments that we mark to market for trading purposes based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions see “derivative instruments” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions 

the types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors 

the following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2005 and 2004 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including 

 

 

 

contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the weightedaverage pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million british thermal units for natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements for futures the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume while the market value amount represents the periodend market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume the fair value for futures swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract the fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes for futures and options the fair value represents i the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions or ii the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions 

additionally for futures and options the weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weightedaverage receive price represents the contract price for short positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for options represents their strike price 

 

 

interest rate risk 

our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our longterm debt obligations we manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt in addition we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and longterm debt balances are adjusted accordingly 

the following table provides information about our longterm debt and interest rate derivative instruments dollars in millions all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented for interest rate swaps the table presents notional amounts and weightedaverage interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract weightedaverage floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

we enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge 

during may 2002 we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in our canadian operations that we intended to redeem in the future under these contracts we sold 400 million of canadian dollars and bought 253 million of us dollars in february 2004 we redeemed our remaining balance of this investment in our canadian operations as a result we liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by us of approximately 34 million with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts 

as of december 31 2005 we had commitments to purchase 303 million of us dollars our market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 27 2006

retail valero’s retail segment operations include the following  valero is one of the largest independent retailers of refined products in the central and southwest united states and eastern canada valero’s retail operations are supported by valero’s proprietary credit card program which had approximately 750000 accounts as of december 31 2004 valero’s retail operations are segregated geographically into two groups the us system and the northeast system   us system sales in the us system represent sales of transportation fuels and convenience store merchandise through valero’s companyoperated retail sites for the year ended december 31 2004 total sales of refined products through the us system’s retail sites averaged approximately 122000 bpd on december 31 2004 valero had 1043 companyoperated sites in its us system of which approximately 75 were owned and 25 were leased valero’s companyoperated stores are operated primarily under the brand names corner store ® and stop n go ®  transportation fuels sold in valero’s us system stores are sold primarily under the brands valero ® and diamond shamrock ®  in addition to transportation fuels valero’s companyoperated convenience stores sell snacks candy beer fast foods cigarettes and fountain drinks valero maintains an ongoing program to modernize and upgrade the convenience stores it operates to identify appropriate markets for further investment and to identify underperforming stores where future investment is deemed nonstrategic in 2004 valero opened 10 new stores reimaged and upgraded 146 stores closed 112 stores and divested 152 stores some of which had been closed in prior years   northeast system sales in valero’s northeast system include the following  valero’s northeast system includes retail operations in eastern canada where valero is a major supplier of refined products serving quebec ontario and the atlantic provinces of newfoundland nova scotia new brunswick and prince edward island for the year ended december 31 2004 total retail sales of refined products through the northeast system averaged approximately 77000 bpd gasoline and diesel fuel are sold under the ultramar ® brand through a network of approximately 1025 outlets throughout eastern canada on december 31 2004 valero owned or leased approximately 470 retail stores in the northeast system and distributed gasoline to approximately 555 dealers and independent jobbers in addition the northeast system operated 87 cardlocks which are card or keyactivated selfservice unattended stations that allow the purchase of gasoline and diesel fuel 24 hours a day the northeast system operations also include a large home heating oil business that provides home heating oil to approximately 180000 households in eastern canada valero’s home heating oil business tends to be seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter 14 

competition the refining and marketing industry continues to be highly competitive valero’s competitors include fully integrated major oil companies  eg  exxonmobil and conocophillips and other independent refining and marketing entities  eg  sunoco and premcor that operate in all of valero’s market areas many of valero’s competitors are engaged on a national or international basis in many segments of the petroleum business including exploration production transportation refining and marketing on scales much larger than valero’s these competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these segments all of valero’s crude oil and feedstock supplies are purchased from thirdparty sources while some competitors have proprietary sources of crude oil available for their own refineries financial returns in the refining and marketing industry depend largely on refining margins and retail fuel margins both of which fluctuate significantly refining margins are impacted by levels of refined product inventories the balance of refined product supply and demand quantities of refined product imports and utilization rates of domestic refineries historically refining margins have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future valero’s ability to process significant amounts of sour crude oils enhances valero’s competitive position in the industry relative to refiners that process primarily sweet crude oils because sour crude oils typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oils valero’s retail business faces competition from fully integrated major oil companies and independent jobbers selling gasoline under national and private brands valero also competes with large grocery stores and other merchandisers the socalled “hypermarts” that also sell transportation fuels 

environmental matters the principal environmental risks associated with valero’s operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by the us environmental protection agency epa and numerous federal state and local authorities under extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention and characteristics and compositions of fuels the significant federal laws applicable to valero’s operations include the clean air act the clean water act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the solid waste disposal act as amended by the resource conservation and recovery act rcra a discussion of significant environmental regulations affecting valero’s operations follows epa’s tier ii gasoline and diesel standards  the epa’s tier ii standards adopted under the clean air act phase in limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline which began in 2004 and diesel fuel sold to highway consumers beginning in 2006 most of valero’s refineries are being modified to comply with the tier ii gasoline and diesel standards valero believes that capital expenditures of approximately 2 billion will be required through 2008 for its refineries to meet the tier ii specifications of which approximately 790 million has been spent through december 31 2004 this estimate includes amounts related to projects at three valero refineries to provide hydrogen necessary for removing sulfur from gasoline and diesel valero expects that its cost estimates will change as additional engineering is completed and progress is made toward construction of these various projects 15 

epa’s section 114 initiative in 2000 the epa issued to a majority of refiners operating in the united states a series of information requests pursuant to section 114 of the clean air act as part of an enforcement initiative valero received a section 114 information request pertaining to all of its refineries owned at that time valero completed its response to the request and it has not been named in any enforcement proceeding by the epa several other refiners however have either reached global settlements with the epa regarding this enforcement initiative or have been subject to enforcement proceedings by the epa valero believes that it will be able to reach a settlement with the epa during 2005 applicable to all of its us refineries valero expects to incur penalties and related expenses in connection with a potential settlement but valero believes that any settlement penalties will be immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition valero expects that a settlement of this matter will require significant capital improvements or changes in operating parameters or both at most of valero’s refineries however valero expects that most of the required capital improvements or changes in operating parameters will be consistent with many of valero’s existing or forecasted strategic capital projects or emission reduction projects already planned for the next several years houstongalveston sip  valero’s houston and texas city refineries are located in the houstongalveston area which is classified as “severe nonattainment” for compliance with the epa’s onehour airquality standard for ozone in october 2001 the epa approved a state implementation plan sip to bring the houstongalveston area into compliance with the onehour ozone standard by 2007 the epaapproved plan was based on a requirement for industry sources to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox by 90 from a 19971999 average actual emissions baseline certain industry and business groups challenged the plan based on technical feasibility of the 90 nox control and its effectiveness in achieving compliance with the ozone standard in december 2002 the texas commission on environmental quality tceq adopted a revised approach for the houstongalveston sip this alternative plan requires an 80 reduction in nox emissions and a 64 reduction in socalled highly reactive volatile organic compounds hrvoc this alternative plan is subject to epa review and approval valero will be required to install nox and hrvoc control and monitoring equipment and implement certain operating practices by 2007 at its houston and texas city refineries at a cost estimated by valero to be approximately 68 million based on the proposed tceq approach capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations  in 2004 valero’s capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were approximately 523 million and are currently estimated to be approximately 900 million for 2005 and approximately 745 million for 2006 the estimates for 2005 and 2006 do not include amounts related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures relating to compliance with environmental regulations is not determinable government regulations are complex are subject to different interpretations and are becoming increasingly more stringent therefore future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time in addition because certain air emissions at valero’s refineries have been grandfathered under particular environmental laws any major upgrades at any of its refineries could require potentially material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 16 

properties valero’s principal properties are described above under the caption “valero’s operations” in addition valero owns feedstock and refined product storage facilities in various locations valero believes that its properties and facilities are generally adequate for its operations and that its facilities are maintained in a good state of repair as of december 31 2004 valero was the lessee under a number of cancelable and noncancelable leases for certain properties valero’s leases are discussed more fully in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements valero’s patents relating to its refining operations are not material to valero as a whole the trademarks and tradenames under which valero conducts its retail and branded wholesale business – including valero ®  diamond shamrock ®  shamrock ®  ultramar ®  beacon ®  corner store ® and stop n go ® – and other trademarks employed in the marketing of petroleum products are important to valero’s wholesale and retail marketing operations 17

overview generally valero’s operations are affected by  valero’s profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil referred to as the “refined product margin” since approximately 50 of valero’s total throughput represents sour crude oil feedstocks valero’s profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices referred to as the “sour crude oil discount” for the year 2004 both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts were the best ever experienced by valero the strength of those positive industry fundamentals significantly enhanced valero’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2004 resulting in earnings per share of 653 this represented a 156 increase over the 255 per share earnings reported for 2003 as adjusted to reflect the effect of a twoforone stock split discussed below valero’s operating results during 2004 benefited significantly from recent investments that increased valero’s capacity to process lowercost feedstocks in march 2004 valero continued its strategic growth through the acquisition of the aruba refinery and related marine bunkering and marketing operations the aruba refinery which processes heavy sour crude oil contributed approximately 290 million to valero’s operating income for 2004 in addition the 45000 bpd coker unit at the texas city refinery which began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 and also processes heavier lowercost crude oil generated nearly 200 million of operating income in 2004 furthermore during 2004 valero realized the benefits from a full year of operations of the st charles refinery that was acquired on july 1 2003 the st charles refinery generated approximately 335 million of operating income in 2004 the positive 2004 results from valero’s operations as well as certain investing and financing activities during 2004 significantly improved valero’s financial position and are expected to favorably position valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return continued growth and improved earnings stability valero’s debttocapitalization ratio net of cash decreased from approximately 40 at december 31 2003 to 307 at the end of 2004 during 2004 valero’s debttocapitalization ratio was positively impacted by the generation of 30 billion of cash from operating activities and the sale of 156 million shares of common stock which partially funded the aruba acquisition as discussed further under “ outlook ” below valero’s increasing ability to process heavier sour crude oils is expected to enable valero to further benefit from wide sour crude oil discounts that valero believes will occur valero believes that it is wellpositioned to benefit from an expected continuation of favorable refining industry fundamentals on july 15 2004 valero’s board of directors approved a twoforone split of valero’s common stock which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on october 7 2004 to stockholders of record on september 23 2004 all share and per share data except par value in this form 10k have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented 27

general operating revenues increased 44 from the year ended december 31 2003 to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations the increases in operating income from 12 billion for 2003 to 30 billion for 2004 and net income from 6215 million for 2003 to 18 billion for 2004 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for valero’s refining segment as discussed below refining operating income for valero’s refining segment was 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 19 billion from the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45 increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and an 18 increase in refining throughput volumes partially offset by an increase in operating expenses refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors  the above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of  refining operating expenses were 29 higher for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the st charles refinery in july 2003 and the aruba refinery in march 2004 higher energy costs primarily related to an increase in natural gas prices increased maintenance expense an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation and increases in insurance expense injected catalyst 32 

professional fees and regulatory costs although total refining operating expenses increased 29 from 2003 to 2004 this increase was 9 on a perbarrel basis the lower percentage increase on a perbarrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the st charles and aruba acquisitions refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24 from the year ended december 31 2003 to the year ended december 31 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new capital projects the acquisitions of the st charles and aruba refineries and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization retail retail operating income was 1750 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 367 million from the year ended december 31 2003 retail fuel margins in the united states decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to the consumer and fuel sales declined in the united states due to fewer stores retail depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations in the northeast operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a significant increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004 corporate expenses and other general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 676 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 employee compensation and benefits increased approximately 41 million from 2003 to 2004 including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately 21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective years the remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions equity in earnings of valero lp represents valero’s equity interest in the earnings of valero lp after march 18 2003 on march 18 2003 valero’s ownership interest in valero lp decreased from 736 to 495 as a result of this decrease in ownership of valero lp combined with certain other partnership governance changes valero ceased consolidating valero lp as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in valero lp the minority interest in net income of valero lp represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of valero lp during the periods that valero consolidated such operations “other income expense net” for the year ended december 31 2004 includes an impairment charge of 572 million to write off the carrying amount of valero’s equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp as further described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements excluding the effect of this impairment charge other income declined 60 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a 170 million gain recognized in 2003 related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the golden eagle business described further in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements partially offset by a 10 million increase in equity income in 2004 from the javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption of the 832 trust originated preferred securities toprs in june 2003 and the settlement of the premium equity participating security units peps units in august 2003 income tax expense increased 5412 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175 increase in income before income tax expense valero’s effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2004 33

 general operating revenues increased 31 from the year ended december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2003 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations the increases in operating income from 4709 million for 2002 to 12 billion for 2003 and net income from 915 million for 2002 to 6215 million for 2003 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for valero’s refining segment as discussed below refining operating income for valero’s refining segment was 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 7448 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 28 increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and a 15 increase in refining throughput volumes partially offset by an increase in operating expenses refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following factors  the above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the effects of  refining operating expenses were 24 higher for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of the st charles refinery in july 2003 higher energy costs primarily related to natural gas an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation and increased maintenance expense associated with unplanned downtime although total operating expenses increased 24 the increase in refining operating expenses on a per barrel basis was 8 from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 7 from the year ended 38 

december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the st charles refinery and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization retail retail operating income was 2117 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 832 million from the year ended december 31 2002 as a result of higher retail fuel margins in both the us and northeast retail systems and operational improvements during 2003 valero continued to implement its us retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in certain key stores and disposing of certain underperforming or nonstrategic stores during 2003 valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores these changes contributed to improved operating income for the retail segment in 2003 corporate expenses and other general and administrative expenses including corporate depreciation and amortization expense increased 769 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 part of the increase was due to the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately 21 million in 2003 as a result of improved financial performance in 2003 as compared to 2002 also in december 2003 a 258 million impairment charge was recognized and reflected in corporate depreciation and amortization expense to write down the carrying amount of valero’s former headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs as described further in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements the remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits expenses ad valorem taxes and litigation costs equity in earnings of valero lp represents valero’s equity interest in the earnings of valero lp after march 18 2003 the date valero ceased consolidating valero lp and began using the equity method to account for its investment in valero lp the minority interest in net income of valero lp represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of valero lp during the periods that valero consolidated such operations the increase in “other income net” from 2002 to 2003 was due mainly to a gain of 170 million related to the sale of notes receivable from tesoro refining and marketing company tesoro in connection with the sale of the golden eagle business in 2002 this gain was offset by a 71 million decrease in equity income from joint ventures and 42 million of expense resulting from the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation net interest and debt expense decreased 244 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in debt levels from 5 billion as of december 31 2002 to 42 billion as of december 31 2003 and an increase in capitalized interest attributable to a larger capital investment program distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased 132 million from the year ended december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2003 due to the redemption of the 832 toprs in june 2003 and the settlement of the peps units in august 2003 income tax expense increased from 582 million in 2002 to 3651 million in 2003 due to the significant increase in pretax income 39 

outlook sour crude oil discounts in january and february 2005 have improved significantly from early 2004 levels and are expected to remain strong throughout 2005 two primary factors support an expectation of continuing wide sour crude oil discounts first a projected increase in the global demand for crude oil in 2005 is expected to result in higher production of medium and heavy sour crude oils however global conversion capacity to process this incremental sour crude oil is limited lack of conversion capacity will result in higher yields of residual fuel byproduct for which demand is declining due to tighter environmental standards sour crude oil discounts will stay wide to justify the yield of lowvalue resid in lowconversion refineries refineries with conversion capacity to upgrade the resid will benefit secondly as refiners seek to meet the requirements of the global movement to cleaner fuels the demand for sweet crude oils continues to grow due to their higher yield of clean products leading to increased prices for sweeter crude oils in addition to the very favorable outlook for sour crude oil discounts the outlook for refined product margins appears favorable as a result of continued strong demand for both gasoline and diesel the favorable factors that were in place in 2004 are expected to continue in 2005 as worldwide demand continues to exceed production capacity in addition refined product margins should benefit from a further tightening of fuel specifications worldwide making it more difficult for foreign refiners to meet the us specifications on imports operationally valero expects to benefit during 2005 from the fullyear effect of the aruba refinery that was acquired in march 2004 and also expects to benefit from strategic projects that were completed during 2004 and will be completed during 2005 particularly those projects that further valero’s strategy of processing heavier and more sour feedstocks for 2005 throughput volume is expected to increase approximately 100000 bpd compared to 2004 as a result of these factors valero believes it is wellpositioned to capitalize on the expected positive industry fundamentals and the resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts during 2005 liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 30 billion compared to 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 12 billion the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due to the significant increase in income in 2004 as described above under “ results of operations ” partially offset by a 2266 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years as reflected in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 working capital requirements decreased by approximately 203 million largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities while 2003 benefited primarily from a 350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under valero’s accounts receivable sales program other significant working capital changes for 2004 which substantially offset each other included increases in receivables accounts payable inventories and taxes other than income taxes all of these changes were attributable to increases in both throughput volumes and commodity prices from december 31 2003 to december 31 2004 valero’s cash balance increased by 4944 million during 2004

in addition to the 30 billion of net cash provided by operating activities valero generated cash from various other sources during 2004 including proceeds of approximately 406 million from the sale of common stock approximately 135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to valero’s benefit plans approximately 109 million of proceeds from dispositions of property plant and equipment and approximately 64 million of net borrowings borrowings net of debt repayments valero used these proceeds to  cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 18 billion compared to 2723 million for the year ended december 31 2002 an increase of 15 billion the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the significant increase in income in 2003 as described above under “ results of operations ” and changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further reflected in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements the primary cause of the change in working capital between the years related to changes in the amount of receivables sold under valero’s accounts receivable sales program during 2003 the amount of receivables sold under the program increased by 350 million while during 2002 working capital was increased by a 123 million decrease in the amount of receivables sold for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition to the 350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold changes in working capital included a 4158 million increase in accounts payable which more than offset a 2700 million increase in inventories inventories increased due to higher volumes of feedstock and refined product inventories on hand at december 31 2003 attributable primarily to i lower than normal feedstock levels at december 31 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers’ strike in venezuela and ii increased refinery utilization rates during 2003

in addition to the 18 billion of net cash provided by operating activities valero generated cash from various other sources during 2003 including proceeds of approximately 300 million from the issuance of senior notes in june 2503 million from the issuance of common stock in march 3799 million from the contribution and sale of certain assets to valero lp 896 million from the sale of tesoro notes held by valero and 942 million from the disposition of certain parts of its home heating oil business and other property plant and equipment valero used these proceeds to  41 

 the remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under valero’s committed and uncommitted bank credit facilities aruba acquisition on march 5 2004 valero completed the purchase of el paso corporation’s aruba refinery and related marine bunkering and marketing operations consideration for the purchase consisted of 200 million in existing cash approximately 27 million in borrowings under valero’s existing bank credit facilities and approximately 406 million in net proceeds from the sale of 156 million shares of valero common stock in addition upon termination on may 4 2004 of an agreement in existence with a thirdparty marketing firm on the date of acquisition valero paid 678 million related to certain refined product inventories owned by the thirdparty marketing firm

receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically valero has not had any significant problems collecting its accounts receivable on august 25 2004 the securities and exchange commission declared effective a new shelf registration statement on form s3 filed by valero to register 35 billion of securities for potential future issuance valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from the public and private capital markets and bank markets to fund its ongoing operating requirements valero expects that to the extent necessary it can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms acceptable to valero equity on february 5 2004 valero sold in a public offering 156 million shares of its common stock which included 20 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter at a price of 2663 per share and received proceeds net of underwriter’s discount commissions and other issuance costs of 4058 million these shares were issued under valero’s prior shelf registration statement to partially fund the aruba acquisition

although valero has no minimum required contributions to its qualified pension plans during 2005 under the employee retirement income security act valero expects to contribute approximately 60 million to its qualified pension plans during 2005 environmental matters valero is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of valero’s refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations for additional information regarding valero’s environmental matters including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental regulations see “environmental matters” in items 1  2 “business  properties” and note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements

termination of this program would require valero to obtain alternate working capital funding which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on valero’s consolidated balance sheet however as of december 31 2004 the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on valero’s liquidity and would not have affected valero’s ability to comply with restrictive covenants in its credit facilities valero is not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity valero’s board of directors has approved an extension of this program which is subject to finalization of the terms of the agreements with the thirdparty financial institutions guarantees in connection with the sale of the golden eagle business in may 2002 valero guaranteed certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by tesoro which totaled approximately 34 million as of december 31 2004 this lease expires in 2010 during the year ended december 31 2004 valero was not required to and did not make any payments under this guarantee

new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for valero’s financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had or is not expected to have a material effect on valero’s consolidated financial statements except as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements under “ fasb statement no 123 revised 2004 ” critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about valero’s critical accounting policies including separate identification of those involving critical accounting estimates and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes valero’s significant accounting policies 46 

critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved as well as the impact on valero’s consolidated financial position and results of operations valero believes that all of its estimates are reasonable impairment of assets longlived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value

in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset estimated remaining life of the asset and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting valero’s earnings valero’s impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with valero’s business plans however providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates valero recognized an impairment charge of 572 million in 2004 related to its equity investment in clear lake methanol partners lp as discussed in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements and an impairment charge of 258 million in 2003 related to valero’s former headquarters buildings as discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements valero did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2002 environmental liabilities valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time

accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations as well as valero’s own internal environmental policies however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation the timing of such remediation and the determination of valero’s obligation in proportion to other parties such estimates are subject to change due to many factors including the identification of new sites requiring remediation changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts and potential improvements in remediation technologies an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes 47 

the balance of and changes in valero’s accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is included in note 24 of notes to consolidated financial statements valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its environmental exposures pension and other postretirement benefit obligations valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside valero’s control for example the discount rate assumption is based on moody’s published aa corporate bond rate as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for valero by an outside consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through 2001 with an asset allocation of 65 equities and 35 bonds representative of the asset mix in valero’s qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in valero’s consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2004 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2005 in millions

 

other critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are less sensitive to management estimates but are presented to enable a more complete understanding and comparability of valero’s more significant accounting policies inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing and refined products are determined under the lastin firstout lifo method of inventory pricing the cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weightedaverage cost method valero utilizes the dollarvalue lifo method and uses average purchase prices during the year to value any increments to its lifo inventory

property plant and equipment valero records depreciation expense on its property plant and equipment primarily using the composite method of depreciation under the composite method of depreciation the costs of minor property units net of salvage value retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation while gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in income although accounting for property plant 

and equipment requires various judgments and estimates including a determination of remaining useful lives salvage values and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and losses changes in such estimates for any particular asset are not expected to significantly affect valero’s results of operations or financial condition due to valero’s use of the composite method of depreciation refinery turnaround costs refinery turnaround costs which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at valero’s refineries are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straightline basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs the frequency of refinery turnarounds varies with each refinery operating unit as of december 31 2004 valero had 3204 million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet

income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements valero must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income to the extent valero believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets valero had a valuation allowance recorded as of december 31 2004 and 2003 due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets primarily consisting of certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards before they expire the valuation allowance is based on valero’s estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable if actual results differ from the estimates or valero adjusts the estimates in future periods valero may need to revise the valuation allowance however significant changes in such valuation allowances have not had in the past and are not expected to have in the future a material effect on valero’s financial condition or results of operations the net deferred income tax assets as of december 31 2004 and 2003 were 5267 million and 6001 million respectively net of valuation allowances of 833 million and 826 million respectively

asset retirement obligations effective january 1 2003 valero adopted statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost an entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made

in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things projected cash flows a creditadjusted riskfree rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation these estimates and assumptions are very subjective however valero believes it has adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations and that changes in estimates in future periods would not have a significant effect on valero’s financial condition or results of operations see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the effect of valero’s adoption of statement no 143 49 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases cash flow hedges in addition valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases refined product sales and natural gas purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales finally valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions see “derivative instruments” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions the types of instruments used in valero’s hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options valero’s positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero’s stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero’s board of directors the following tables provide information about valero’s derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2004 and 2003 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including     contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the weightedaverage pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million british thermal units for natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements the gain loss on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes for futures and options the gain loss represents i the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions or ii the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions additionally for futures and options the weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weightedaverage receive price represents the contract price for short positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for options represents their strike price 50 

 

 

interest rate risk valero’s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to its longterm debt obligations valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt in addition valero utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and longterm debt balances are adjusted accordingly the following table provides information about valero’s longterm debt and interest rate derivative instruments dollars in millions all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented for interest rate swaps the table presents notional amounts and weightedaverage interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract weightedaverage floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date  

 

on march 25 2004 valero entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of 200 million these interest rate swap contracts currently have an estimated pay rate of 36 and hedge 200 million of debt with a fixed interest rate of 475 foreign currency risk valero enters into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge during may 2002 valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its canadian operations that valero intended to redeem in the future under these contracts valero sold 400 million of canadian dollars and bought 2534 million of us dollars in february 2004 valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its canadian operations as a result valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by valero of approximately 34 million with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts as of december 31 2004 valero had other commitments to purchase 50 million of us dollars valero’s market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 6 2005 as of december 31 2004 valero had also entered into a foreign currency exchange contract relating to the purchase of commercial paper which requires valero to sell 200 million of us dollars in may 2005 the effect on this contract of a hypothetical 10 change in the yearend exchange rate would be approximately 2 million 54

jean gaulin refinery  the jean gaulin refinery is located in lévis canada near quebec city it generally processes lowerquality light sweet acidic crude oils and sour crude oils into conventional gasoline lowsulfur diesel jet fuels heating oil and propane the refinery receives crude oil by ship at its deepwater dock on the st lawrence river valero charters large icestrengthened doublehulled crude oil tankers that can navigate the st lawrence river yearround the refinery’s production is transported primarily by unit trains to markets in quebec and new brunswick and by tankers and trucks primarily to markets in canada’s atlantic provinces paulsboro refinery  the paulsboro refinery is located in paulsboro new jersey approximately 15 miles south of philadelphia on the delaware river the refinery processes primarily sour crude oils into a wide slate of products including gasoline distillates a variety of lube oil basestocks asphalt and fuel oil feedstocks and refined products are typically transported by tanker and barge via refineryowned dock facilities along the delaware river exxon mobil corporation’s product distribution system an onsite truck rack railcars and the colonial pipeline which allows products to be sold into the new york harbor market   feedstock supply approximately 70 of valero’s crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market valero’s term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks directly or indirectly from various foreign national oil companies including feedstocks originating in saudi arabia mexico iraq kuwait venezuela ecuador and africa as well as international and domestic oil companies at marketrelated prices approximately 80 of valero’s crude oil feedstocks are imported from foreign sources and approximately 20 are domestic the us network of crude oil pipelines and terminals including those facilities owned by valero lp allows valero to acquire crude oil from producing leases domestic crude oil trading centers and ships delivering cargoes of foreign and domestic crude oil access to the valero lp network also allows valero to transport crude oil supplies to many of its us refineries at a competitive cost compared to facilities that lack proprietary supply networks valero’s jean gaulin refinery relies on foreign crude oil that is delivered to its st lawrence river dock facility by ship 12 

valero’s cost to acquire feedstocks and the price for which valero ultimately can sell refined products depend on a number of factors beyond valero’s control including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil gasoline diesel and other feedstocks and refined products these in turn are dependent upon among other things the availability of imports the production levels of domestic and foreign suppliers us relationships with foreign governments political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation valero uses the futures market to manage the price risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of its delivery date and in maintaining valero’s inventories   refining segment sales valero’s refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets these sales include refined products that are manufactured in valero’s refining operations as well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties most of valero’s refineries have access to deepwater transportation facilities and interconnect with commoncarrier pipeline systems allowing valero to sell products in most major geographic regions of the united states and eastern canada no customer accounted for more than 10 of valero’s total operating revenues in 2003   wholesale marketing valero is a leading wholesale marketer of branded and unbranded transportation fuels valero markets on a wholesale basis in about 40 us states and canada primarily through an extensive rack marketing network the principal purchasers of valero’s transportation fuels from terminal truck racks are wholesalers distributors retailers and truckdelivered end users throughout the united states the majority of valero’s rack volumes are sold through unbranded channels the remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the valero brand family in the united states these distributors and dealers operate approximately 2400 branded sites representing currently branded sites and sites under contract for branding with valero these sites are independently owned and are supplied by valero under multiyear contracts valero is consolidating the number of brands used in its various markets for wholesale branded sites valero promotes its valero ® and beacon ® brands in california and its valero ® and shamrock ® brands on the us east coast in the midcontinent and southwest regions valero promotes its diamond shamrock ® and shamrock ® brands valero’s canadian wholesale operations use the ultramar ® brand valero also sells a variety of other products produced at its refineries including asphalt lube base oils and commodity petrochemicals these products are transported via pipelines barges trucks and railcars in connection with the ability of valero’s refineries to process significant amounts of heavy sour crude oil valero produces approximately 60000 bpd of asphalt which is sold to customers in the paving and roofing industries valero is the second largest producer of asphalt in the united states valero produces asphalt at nine refineries and markets asphalt in 20 states through 13 terminal facilities lubricant base oils and process oils are produced at valero’s paulsboro refinery the refinery can produce 12000 bpd of highly refined paraffinic and aromatic oils for use in a variety of lubricant and process applications these products are sold to a variety of customers including exxonmobil under a longterm agreement exxonmobil purchases about 50 of the paulsboro refinery’s lubricant oil production with the balance sold to independent blenders additive manufacturers and industrial and marine customers 13 

valero produces and markets a variety of commodity petrochemicals including aromatic solvents benzene toluene and xylene refinery and chemicalgrade propylene and anhydrous ammonia aromatic solvents and propylene are sold to customers in the chemical industry for further processing into such products as paints plastics and adhesives ammonia produced at valero’s mckee refinery is sold to customers in the agriculture industry to be used as fertilizer valero also sells petroleum coke and sulfur to domestic and international customers principally in the utility and agricultural sectors respectively   product supply and trading valero sells a significant portion of its gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels valero’s bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain bulk endusers such as railroads airlines and utilities valero’s bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline barges and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs valero also enters into refined product exchange and purchase agreements these agreements enable valero to minimize transportation costs optimize refinery utilization balance refined product availability broaden geographic distribution and sell to markets not connected to valero lp’s refined product pipeline system exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by valero to unaffiliated companies at valero’s and third parties’ terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to valero by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations purchase agreements involve valero’s purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations most of these agreements are longstanding arrangements however they generally can be terminated with 30 to 90 days notice valero does not anticipate an interruption in its ability to exchange or purchase refined products in the near future   logistics through agreements with valero lp valero has access to a logistics system that complements its refining and marketing business primarily in the us gulf coast west coast and midcontinent regions valero lp is a publicly traded master limited partnership that as of december 31 2003 owned almost 800 miles of crude oil pipelines with related storage and batching facilities approximately 3800 miles of refined product pipelines and a 25mile hydrogen pipeline valero lp also owned 19 refined product terminals with 166 tanks that have storage capacity of approximately 4 million barrels and it owned 58 crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks and related assets with a storage capacity of approximately 11 million barrels valero assumed its ownership interest in valero lp formerly known as “shamrock logistics lp” upon completion of the uds acquisition valero owns approximately 46 of valero lp which includes its 2 general partner interest valero lp’s refined product pipelines transport refined products from valero’s mckee three rivers ardmore and corpus christi refineries directly or indirectly to markets in the midcontinent southwest and the texasmexico border region of the united states in addition valero lp’s crude oil pipelines and storage facilities supply valero’s corpus christi west texas city mckee three rivers ardmore and benicia refineries with crude oil and other feedstocks and provide access to domestic and foreign crude oil sources 14 

retail valero’s retail segment operations involve the sale of transportation fuels at retail stores and unattended selfservice cardlocks the sale of convenience store merchandise in retail stores and the sale of home heating oil to residential customers valero is one of the largest independent retailers of refined products in the central and southwest united states with strong brand identification in an 11state retail area including texas california colorado and arizona and in eastern canada valero’s retail operations are supported by valero’s proprietary credit card program which had approximately 700000 accounts as of december 31 2003 valero uses electronic pointofsale pos credit card processing at substantially all of its company and dealeroperated stores valero added satellite technology at selected locations in 2003 to enhance its credit card processing valero’s retail operations are segregated geographically into two groups the us system and the northeast system   us system sales in the us system represent sales of refined products and convenience store merchandise through valero’s companyoperated retail sites for the year ended december 31 2003 total sales of refined products through the us system’s retail sites averaged approximately 129000 bpd valero has approximately 1150 companyoperated sites in its us system of these sites about onehalf are owned and onehalf are leased companyoperated stores are operated under a variety of brand names including corner store ®  ultramart ® and stop n go ®  stores in valero’s us system sell gasoline and diesel fuel under several brand names in valero’s california retail facilities valero promotes its valero ® brand in valero’s midcontinent and southwest retail facilities valero promotes its diamond shamrock ® brand companyoperated convenience stores sell in addition to gasoline and diesel fuels a wide variety of immediately consumable products such as snacks candy beer fast foods cigarettes and fountain drinks valero has an ongoing program to modernize and upgrade the convenience stores it operates these efforts are focused primarily on improving the uniformity and appearance of existing stores improvements generally include new exterior signage lighting and canopies and pump and interior store upgrades valero continues to review its retail network to identify appropriate markets for further investment and to identify underperforming stores where future investment is deemed nonstrategic in 2003 valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores   northeast system sales in valero’s northeast system represent sales of refined products and convenience store merchandise through valero’s companyoperated retail sites and cardlocks sales of refined products through sites owned by independent dealers and jobbers and sales of home heating oil to residential customers valero’s northeast system includes retail operations in eastern canada where valero is a major supplier of refined products serving quebec ontario and the atlantic provinces of newfoundland nova scotia new brunswick and prince edward island for the year ended december 31 2003 total retail sales of refined products through the northeast system averaged approximately 79000 bpd gasoline and diesel fuel are sold under the ultramar ® brand through a network of approximately 1050 outlets throughout eastern canada as of december 31 2003 valero owned or leased approximately 475 retail stores and distributed gasoline to approximately 575 dealers and independent jobbers in addition the northeast system operates 86 cardlocks which are card or keyactivated selfservice unattended stations that allow commercial trucking and governmental fleets to buy gasoline and diesel fuel 24 hours a day the northeast system operations also include a large home heating oil business valero sells home heating oil under the ultramar ® brand to approximately 163000 households in eastern canada valero’s home heating oil business tends to be seasonal to the extent of increased demand for home heating oil during the winter 15 

competition the refining and marketing industry continues to be highly competitive valero’s competitors include fully integrated major oil companies  eg  exxonmobil and conocophillips and other independent refining and marketing entities  eg  sunoco and premcor that operate in all of valero’s market areas many of valero’s competitors are engaged on a national or international basis in many segments of the petroleum business including exploration production transportation refining and marketing on scales much larger than valero’s these competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these segments all of valero’s crude oil and feedstock supplies are purchased from thirdparty sources while some competitors have proprietary sources of crude oil available for their own refineries financial returns in the refining and marketing industry depend largely on refining margins and retail fuel margins both of which fluctuate significantly refining margins are impacted by levels of refined product inventories the balance of refined product supply and demand quantities of refined product imports and utilization rates of domestic refineries historically refining margins have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future valero’s ability to process significant amounts of sour crude oils enhances valero’s competitive position in the industry as sour crude oils typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oils valero’s retail business faces competition from fully integrated major oil companies that have increased their efforts to capture retail market share in recent years valero also competes with large grocery stores and other merchandisers the socalled “hypermarts” that often sell gasoline at aggressively competitive prices in order to attract customers to their sites in quebec canada and in the adjacent atlantic provinces valero is the largest independent retailer of gasoline 

environmental matters the principal environmental risks associated with valero’s operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil surface water or groundwater valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by the us environmental protection agency epa and numerous federal state and local authorities under extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention and characteristics and compositions of fuels the significant federal laws applicable to valero’s operations include the clean air act the clean water act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the solid waste disposal act as amended by the resource conservation and recovery act rcra a discussion of significant environmental regulations affecting valero’s operations follows epa’s “tier ii” gasoline and diesel standards  the epa’s tier ii standards adopted under the clean air act phase in limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004 and the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold to highway consumers beginning in 2006 modifications will be required at most of valero’s refineries as a result of the tier ii gasoline and diesel standards valero believes that capital expenditures of approximately 15 billion will be required through 2006 for valero to meet the new tier ii specifications of which approximately 500 million was expended by the end of 2003 the aggregate estimate of expenditures includes amounts related to projects at two valero refineries to improve refinery yield and octane balance and to provide hydrogen as part of the process of removing sulfur from gasoline and diesel valero expects that such estimates will change as additional engineering is completed and progress is made toward construction of these various projects factors that will affect the impact of these regulations on valero include its ultimate selection of specific technologies to meet the tier ii standards and uncertainties related to timing permitting and construction of specific units valero expects to meet all tier ii gasoline and diesel standards by their respective effective dates 16 

epa’s section 114 initiative in 2000 the epa issued to a majority of refiners operating in the united states a series of information requests pursuant to section 114 of the clean air act as part of an enforcement initiative valero received a section 114 information request pertaining to all of its refineries owned at that time valero has completed its response to the request several other refiners have reached settlements with the epa regarding this enforcement initiative though valero has not been named in any proceeding it also has been discussing the possibility of settlement with the epa regarding this initiative based in part upon announced settlements and evaluation of its relative position valero expects to incur penalties and related expenses in connection with a potential settlement of this enforcement initiative valero believes that any potential settlement penalties will be immaterial to its results of operations and financial position however valero believes that any potential settlement with the epa in this matter will require various capital improvements or changes in operating parameters or both at some or all of its refineries which could be material in the aggregate houstongalveston sip  valero’s houston and texas city refineries are located in the houstongalveston area which is classified as “severe nonattainment” for compliance with epa airquality standards for ozone in october 2001 the epa approved a state implementation plan sip to bring the houstongalveston area into compliance with the epa’s ozone standards by 2007 the epaapproved plan was based on a requirement for industry sources to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox by 90 from a 19971999 average actual emissions baseline certain industry and business groups challenged the plan based on technical feasibility of the 90 nox control and its effectiveness in meeting the ozone standard in december 2002 the texas commission on environmental quality tceq adopted a revised approach for the houstongalveston sip this alternative plan requires an 80 reduction in nox emissions and a 64 reduction in socalled highly reactive volatile organic compounds hrvoc this alternative plan is subject to epa scrutiny and approval valero’s texas city and houston refineries will be required to install nox and hrvoc control and monitoring equipment and practices by 2007 at a cost estimated by valero to be approximately 60 million based on the proposed tceq approach mtbe restrictions the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states resulting from gasoline leaks primarily from underground storage tanks has led to public concern that mtbe poses a possible health risk as a result of heightened public concern california banned the use of mtbe as a gasoline component in california beginning january 1 2004 and the california air resources board’s specifications for carb phase iii gasoline became effective on that date valero’s costs to permit and modify its california refineries to comply with carb phase iii gasoline specifications and eliminate mtbe as a gasoline component were approximately 60 million other states and the epa also have either passed or proposed or are considering proposals to restrict or ban the use of mtbe if mtbe were to be restricted or banned throughout the united states valero believes that it can modify its remaining noncalifornia mtbeproducing facilities to produce other octane enhancing products for an immaterial capital investment capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations  in 2003 valero’s capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were approximately 540 million and are currently estimated to be approximately 625 million for 2004 and approximately 770 million for 2005 these estimates for 2004 and 2005 do not include amounts related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures relating to compliance with environmental regulations is not determinable 17 

governmental regulations are complex are subject to different interpretations and are becoming increasingly more stringent therefore future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time in addition because certain air emissions at valero’s refineries have been grandfathered under particular environmental laws any major upgrades at any of its refineries could require potentially material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 

employees as of february 29 2004 valero had 19621 employees including salaried and hourly employees of which 16136 were employed in the united states and 3485 were employed in canada

overview as of december 31 2003 valero owned and operated 14 refineries in the united states and canada with a combined throughput capacity including crude oil and other feedstocks of approximately 21 million barrels per day valero markets refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a network of more than 4500 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the united states and eastern canada valero’s operations are affected by  valero’s profitability is determined in large part by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil or the refined product margin additionally since almost 50 of valero’s throughput represents sour crude oil feedstocks valero’s profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices referred to as the sour crude oil discount during 2003 both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts improved significantly from 2002 levels due to various factors including strong refined product demand in both domestic and foreign markets and an anticipated reduction in supply attributable to various factors including the ban on mtbe in certain areas of the united states and implementation of the new cleanfuel tier ii regulations valero believes that the outlook for both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts is favorable the positive 2003 results from valero’s operations as well as certain investing and financing activities during 2003 are expected to favorably position valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return continued growth and improved earnings stability during 2003 valero reduced its debt by approximately 726 million resulting in a decrease in its debttocapitalization ratio net of cash from approximately 50 at december 31 2002 to approximately 40 at the end of 2003 during 2003 valero’s debt and debttocapitalization ratio were positively impacted by the following  in addition during 2003 valero continued its strategic growth through the acquisition of the st charles refinery and the startup of a 45000 barrelperday coker unit at the texas city refinery the st charles refinery operated at 95 of capacity averaging almost 200000 barrels per day of throughput since valero acquired it on july 1 2003 the st charles refinery contributed approximately 39 million to valero’s operating income for the last six months of 2003 the 45000 barrelperday coker unit at the texas city refinery began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will enable the refinery to process heavier lowercost crude oil the ability to process the lowercost crude oil is expected to significantly lower the refinery’s average feedstock costs going forward the st charles acquisition and the startup of the coker unit at the texas city refinery are expected to further enable valero to benefit from wider sour crude oil discounts that valero believes will occur valero believes that it has significantly improved its feedstock flexibility and leverage to benefit from an expected continuation of good refining industry fundamentals 27

the following notes relate to references on pages 28 through 31  general valero’s net income for the year ended december 31 2003 was 6215 million or 509 per share compared to 915 million or 083 per share for the year ended december 31 2002 for the fourth quarter of 2003 valero’s net income was 1316 million or 101 per share compared to 890 million or 081 per share for the fourth quarter of 2002 31 

operating revenues increased 31 from the year ended december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2003 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations the increase in operating income from 4709 million for 2002 to 12 billion for 2003 was attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for valero’s refining segment as discussed below refining operating income for valero’s refining segment was 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 7448 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 28 increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and a 15 increase in refining throughput volumes partially offset by an increase in operating expenses refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following factors  the above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the effects of  refining operating expenses were 24 higher for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of the st charles refinery in july 2003 higher energy costs primarily related to natural gas an increase in employee compensation expense including increased variable compensation and increased maintenance expense associated with unplanned downtime however the increase in refining operating expenses on a per barrel basis was only 8 from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 7 from the year ended december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the st charles refinery and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization 32 

retail retail operating income was 2117 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 832 million from the year ended december 31 2002 as a result of higher retail fuel margins in both the us and northeast retail systems and operational improvements during 2003 valero continued to implement its us retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in certain key stores and disposing of certain underperforming or nonstrategic stores during 2003 valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores these changes contributed to improved operating income for the retail segment in 2003 corporate expenses and other administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization expense increased 769 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 part of the increase was due to the recognition of increased variable compensation expense of approximately 21 million in 2003 as a result of improved financial performance in 2003 as compared to 2002 also in december 2003 a 258 million impairment charge was recognized and reflected in administrative depreciation and amortization expense to write down the carrying value of valero’s current headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs as described further in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements the remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits expenses ad valorem taxes and litigation costs equity in earnings of valero lp represents valero’s equity interest in the earnings of valero lp after march 18 2003 on march 18 2003 valero’s ownership interest in valero lp decreased from 736 to 495 as a result of this decrease in ownership of valero lp combined with certain other partnership governance changes valero ceased consolidating valero lp as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in valero lp valero’s ownership interest in valero lp has been further reduced to 457 as of december 31 2003 primarily as a result of the issuance of additional common units by valero lp in april and august 2003 prior to march 18 2003 valero consolidated the operations of valero lp the minority interest in net income of valero lp represented the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of valero lp during the periods that valero consolidated such operations the increase in other income net from 2002 to 2003 is due mainly to a gain of 170 million related to the sale of notes receivable from tesoro refining and marketing company tesoro in connection with the sale of the golden eagle refinery and related assets in 2002 this gain was offset by a 71 million decrease in equity income from joint ventures and the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation of 42 million net interest expense decreased 244 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in debt levels from 5 billion as of december 31 2002 to 42 billion as of december 31 2003 and an increase in capitalized interest attributable to a larger capital investment program distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased 132 million from the year ended december 31 2002 to the year ended december 31 2003 due to the redemption of the 832 trust originated preferred securities toprs in june 2003 and the settlement of the peps units in august 2003 income tax expense increased from 582 million in 2002 to 3651 million in 2003 due to the significant increase in pretax income 33 

the following is a reconciliation of net income to ebitda in millions  

valero utilizes the financial measure of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda which is not defined under united states generally accepted accounting principles management presents ebitda in its filings under the securities exchange act of 1934 and its press releases management uses this financial measure because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance in addition ebitda is used in the computation of certain debt covenant ratios included in valero’s various debt agreements ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the period nor is it presented as an alternative to operating income or income before income taxes it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles valero’s method of computation of ebitda may or may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies the following is the computation of the ratio of ebitda to interest incurred in millions

the following notes relate to references on pages 35 through 38  general valero’s net income for the year ended december 31 2002 was 915 million or 083 per share compared to net income of 5636 million or 883 per share for the year ended december 31 2001 38 

operating revenues increased 94 for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of the additional throughput volumes from the refinery operations acquired in the uds el paso and huntway acquisitions and the additional revenues generated from the retail operations acquired in the uds acquisition partially offset by a decline in refined product prices however operating income for 2002 declined 5305 million or 53 from the 10 billion reported in 2001 due mainly to a 5421 million decrease in operating income from the refining segment and a 1150 million increase in administrative expenses including related depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by an increase of 1266 million in operating income from the retail segment attributable to the retail operations acquired in the uds acquisition operating income for 2002 benefited from synergies that were created as a result of the merger between valero and uds synergies of the combined company resulted in both gross margin improvements and reductions in operating and administrative expenses the gross margin synergies related primarily to a reduction in inventory levels yield optimization and operational initiatives operating and administrative expense synergies were achieved mainly from incorporating best practices between the two companies’ procurement and energy contract initiatives and eliminating salaries and benefits associated with former uds executives and other employees refining operating income for valero’s refining segment declined from 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 to 6187 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease in refining segment operating income was due principally to a 34 decline in the throughput margin per barrel attributable to depressed sour crude oil discounts and lower refined product margins in all of valero’s markets during 2002 refining total throughput margin was negatively impacted by the following factors  the above decreases in refining throughput margin were partially offset by the increased throughput volumes resulting from the uds huntway and el paso acquisitions a net benefit of approximately 76 million resulting from the settlement in june and august 2002 of petroleum products purchase agreements and related hedges and a 39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of its lifo inventories refining operating expenses and refining depreciation and amortization expense were 57 and 70 higher respectively for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 as a result of the additional refinery operations from the uds el paso and huntway acquisitions however these operating costs on a per barrel basis remained stable from 2001 to 2002 as a result of the additional throughput volumes from these acquisitions 39 

retail retail operating income was 1285 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 19 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the 2002 retail operating income includes both the us and northeast retail operations acquired in the uds acquisition the 2001 retail operations included only 11 northern california retail stores operated by valero at that time during 2002 pursuant to a plan adopted in conjunction with the uds acquisition valero implemented various changes in its retail operations that benefited results in 2002 and are expected to continue to benefit future results for the retail segment as part of these changes 76 stores were reimaged and upgraded in 2002 these changes also included the closure or divestiture of approximately 160 stores and the identification of an additional 150 stores for closure or divestiture gains or losses on divested stores are recognized to the extent of the difference between any net proceeds received on disposition and the net book value of each store retail selling expenses and retail depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2002 were significantly higher than 2001 due to the additional retail stores acquired in the uds acquisition corporate expenses and other administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization expense increased 1150 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the increase was due primarily to additional administrative expenses resulting from the uds acquisition and increases in employee salaries and benefits and professional services partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of the lower level of operating income recognized during 2002 and the nonrecurrence in 2002 of integration and early retirement costs incurred in 2001 in connection with the uds acquisition other income expense net increased 132 million from expense of 46 million for the year ended december 31 2001 to income of 86 million for the year ended december 31 2002 due primarily to a 70 million increase in equity income from valero’s investments in joint ventures and 59 million of interest income related to the amortization of the discount on the notes receivable from tesoro in connection with the sale of the golden eagle business net interest and debt expense increased 1972 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the increase was due primarily to interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance the uds acquisition coupled with interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the uds acquisition as well as the fullyear effect of interest expense on the capital lease obligations associated with the june 1 2001 el paso acquisition the minority interest in net income of valero lp represents the minority unitholders’ share of the net income of valero lp distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts increased to 300 million for the year ended december 31 2002 from 134 million for the year ended december 31 2001 due to the distributions incurred on the 200 million toprs assumed in the uds acquisition income tax expense decreased 2731 million from 2001 to 2002 mainly as a result of lower operating income and higher interest expense 40

outlook during january and february 2004 refining industry fundamentals continued to improve resulting in both higher refined product margins and wider sour crude oil discounts than those realized in the fourth quarter of 2003 in regard to refined products distillate demand has been strong primarily due to the cold weather in the northeast which has helped support heating oil margins at attractive levels gasoline margins have also increased since the end of 2003 as a result of strong demand resulting from improved economies in both the united states and asia in addition gasoline margins have benefited from reduced imports attributable in part to the impact of the new lower sulfur specifications for gasoline that became effective january 1 2004 and the effect of the removal of mtbe from gasoline in several states refined product supplies are expected to be further impacted in the short term as a high level of industrywide turnaround activity is anticipated during the first quarter of 2004 valero expects these factors to continue to support strong gasoline margins as summer approaches in addition to the favorable outlook for refined product margins sour crude oil discounts have widened significantly from the fourth quarter of 2003 and are expected to continue to benefit from various factors these factors include an expected increase in sour crude oil supplies on world markets partly due to certain refiners processing more sweet crude oil and less sour crude oil as a result of the new lower sulfur specifications also the favorable economic environment anticipated for 2004 should result in the production of more sour crude oil to satisfy expected higher refined product demand which should also contribute to wide sour crude oil discounts the significant turnaround activity is also projected to positively impact sour crude oil discounts since a significant amount of the reduced capacity resulting from these turnarounds is sour crude oil processing capacity operationally valero expects to benefit during 2004 from the fullyear effect of the st charles refinery that was acquired in july 2003 and from an expansion of that facility’s crude and coker units in march 2004 valero also expects to benefit throughout 2004 from a new 45000 barrelperday coker unit at the texas city refinery that began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 in addition valero’s acquisition of the aruba refinery in march 2004 is expected to be accretive to valero’s earnings for 2004 and beyond the aruba refinery processes heavy sour crude oil primarily mayan crude oil and therefore complements valero’s strategy of processing heavy sour crude oil that generally sells at a discount to sweet crude oil 41 

as a result of these factors valero believes it is wellpositioned to capitalize during 2004 on the expected positive industry fundamentals and the resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 18 billion compared to 2723 million for the year ended december 31 2002 an increase of 15 billion the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the significant increase in income in 2003 as described above under “results of operations” and changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further described in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements the primary cause of the change in working capital between the years related to changes in the amount of receivables sold under valero’s accounts receivable sales programs during 2003 the amount of receivables sold under the program increased by 350 million while during 2002 working capital was unfavorably impacted by a 123 million decrease in the amount of receivables sold for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition to the 3500 million increase in the amount of receivables sold changes in working capital included a 4158 million increase in accounts payable which more than offset a 2700 million increase in inventories inventories increased due to higher volumes of feedstock and refined product inventories on hand at december 31 2003 attributable primarily to i lower than normal feedstock levels at december 31 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers’ strike in venezuela and ii increased refinery utilization rates during 2003 in addition to the 18 billion of net cash provided by operating activities valero generated cash from various other sources during 2003 including proceeds of approximately 300 million from the issuance of senior notes in june 2503 million from the issuance of common stock in march 3799 million from the contribution and sale of certain assets to valero lp 896 million from the sale of tesoro notes held by valero and 942 million from the disposition of certain parts of its home heating oil business and other property plant and equipment valero used these proceeds to  the remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under valero’s committed and uncommitted bank credit facilities cash flows for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 2723 million compared to 9055 million for the year ended december 31 2001 a decrease of 6332 million the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the unfavorable change in income as described above under “results of operations” and an 801 million increase in the amount of cash used to fund working capital and deferred charges and credits changes in working capital for the year ended december 31 2002 included 42 

 valero’s investing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 provided net cash of 2486 million valero’s investing activities included the receipt of 3009 million from the liquidation of its investment in the diamondkoch joint venture and 9250 million from the sale of the golden eagle business partially offset by payments of 8034 million for capital expenditures deferred turnaround and catalyst costs and earnout payments and net cash requirements related to the golden eagle business of 1835 million during 2002 operating and investing activities provided 5209 million of cash which was used primarily to reduce valero’s debt by 4129 million with a resulting increase of 1095 million in valero’s cash balance capital investments during the year ended december 31 2003 valero expended 11 billion for capital investments of which 9758 million related to capital expenditures including approximately 540 million for environmental projects and 1364 million related to deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2003 included 438 million to fund construction of gasoline desulfurization units at the texas city paulsboro quebec and corpus christi west refineries in response to tier ii sulfur regulations the capital expenditure amount above excludes 134 million and 55 million respectively related to a coker facility at the texas city refinery and the expansion of the former uds headquarters facility which will be valero’s new corporate headquarters both of which were being funded through structured lease arrangements 43 

through december 31 2003 see the discussion below in “structured lease arrangements” under “offbalance sheet arrangements” and in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition to the 11 billion of capital investments discussed above 2750 million was expended for the purchase of certain convenience stores and valero’s current headquarters buildings which were previously subject to structured lease arrangements see the discussion in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements 1061 million was invested in the cameron highway oil pipeline project 506 million of payments were made related to the earnout contingency agreements discussed below and 344 million of cash was expended for strategic acquisitions in connection with valero’s acquisitions of basis petroleum inc in 1997 the paulsboro refinery in 1998 and the st charles refinery in 2003 the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years five years and seven years respectively following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level see the discussion in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements any payments due under these earnout arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits during 2003 valero made earnout contingency payments of 350 million related to the acquisition of basis petroleum inc and 156 million related to the acquisition of the paulsboro refinery no future earnout payments related to the acquisition of the paulsboro refinery will be due as the term of that earnout arrangement expired in september 2003 based on estimated margin levels for 2004 earnout payments related to the basis petroleum and st charles acquisitions of approximately 35 million and 50 million respectively would be due in may 2004 and january 2005 for 2004 excluding the aruba refinery valero expects to incur approximately 15 billion for capital investments including approximately 13 billion for capital expenditures approximately 625 million of which is for environmental projects and approximately 215 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs capital expenditures for 2004 for the aruba refinery are estimated to be approximately 100 million the capital expenditure estimate excludes the purchase of properties previously leased under four structured lease arrangements as further discussed in “structured lease arrangements” under “offbalance sheet arrangements” below the capital expenditure estimate also excludes anticipated expenditures related to the earnout contingency agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions valero continuously evaluates its capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant contractual obligations valero’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 are summarized below in millions  

longterm debt payments for longterm debt are at stated values and include payments for debt related to bank facilities as described below under the caption “other commercial commitments” none of valero’s agreements have rating agency triggers that would automatically require valero to post additional collateral however in the event of certain downgrades of valero’s senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services borrowings 44 

under some of valero’s bank credit facilities structured leases and other arrangements would become more expensive operating lease obligations valero’s operating lease obligations include leases for land office facilities and equipment retail facilities and equipment dock facilities transportation equipment and various facilities and equipment used in the storage transportation production and sale of refined products operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by valero under subleases operating lease obligations exclude longterm operating lease commitments that have been funded through structured lease arrangements with nonconsolidated thirdparty entities as discussed below under the caption “offbalance sheet arrangements” and in note 23 of notes to consolidated financial statements which are reflected separately in the table above purchase obligations a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms including i fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased ii fixed minimum or variable price provisions and iii the approximate timing of the transaction valero has various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements valero enters into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities feedstock and storage to operate its refineries many of valero’s purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements while others are based on valero’s usage requirements the purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both shortterm and longterm obligations and are based on minimum quantities to be purchased andor estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions future payments related to benefit plans are not included in the table above due to the difficulty in estimating such payments that results from the many variables affecting the calculation valero has not made in the past nor does it expect to make in the future payments for feedstock or services that it has not received or will not receive nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions other commercial commitments as of december 31 2003 valero’s committed lines of credit included in millions  

in november 2003 valero replaced its previous 750 million 364day revolving bank credit facility with a new 750 million threeyear revolving credit facility with terms and conditions similar to the 364day facility 45 

valero’s other commercial commitments as of december 31 2003 were as follows in millions  

as of december 31 2003 valero had 2561 million of letters of credit outstanding under its uncommitted shortterm bank credit facilities cdn 78 million of letters of credit outstanding under its canadian committed facility and 2450 million of letters of credit outstanding under its committed facilities under valero’s revolving bank credit facilities valero’s debttocapitalization ratio net of cash was 403 as of december 31 2003 as compared to 504 as of december 31 2002 for purposes of the computation as of december 31 2002 50 of the 200 million of toprs and 20 of the 1725 million of trust preferred securities issued as part of the peps units were included as debt valero’s refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers these concentrations of customers may impact valero’s overall exposure to credit risk either positively or negatively in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions however valero believes that its portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk historically valero has not had any significant problems collecting its accounts receivable valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations and to the extent necessary from the public and private capital markets and bank markets to fund its ongoing operating requirements valero expects that to the extent necessary it can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings however there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms acceptable to valero peps units as of december 31 2002 the “companyobligated preferred securities of subsidiary trusts” in valero’s consolidated balance sheet included 1725 million of 775 peps units 69 million units at 2500 per unit the peps units were issued in 2000 by valero under a shelf registration statement upon issuance each peps unit consisted of a trust preferred security issued by vec trust i and an associated purchase contract obligating the holder of the peps unit to purchase on august 18 2003 a number of shares of common stock from valero for 25 per purchase contract the number of shares of common stock issuable for each purchase contract was to be determined at a price based on the average price of valero common stock for the relevant 20day trading period under the original agreement holders of peps units could settle their purchase contracts by paying cash to valero or by remarketing their pledged trust preferred securities and using the proceeds from the remarketing to settle the purchase contracts in accordance with the original agreement the distribution rate on the trust preferred securities was to be reset on august 18 2003 based on the price for which the trust preferred securities were remarketed in accordance with the terms of the trust on august 12 2003 valero dissolved vec trust i and substituted its senior deferrable notes for the trust preferred securities as a result valero’s senior deferrable notes were scheduled to be remarketed in place of the trust preferred 46 

securities with the interest rate on the senior deferrable notes to be reset on august 18 2003 based upon the price for which the senior deferrable notes were remarketed the remarketing of the senior deferrable notes was scheduled for august 13 2003 the holders of approximately 636 million peps units opted to settle their purchase contract obligations by remarketing the senior deferrable notes totaling 1589 million while holders of approximately 054 million peps units elected to settle their purchase contract obligations with cash and retain their senior deferrable notes totaling 136 million in lieu of participating in the remarketing on august 13 valero received notice from the remarketing agent that a failed remarketing as defined in the prospectus supplement related to the peps units of the senior deferrable notes was deemed to have occurred the 1589 million of senior deferrable notes surrendered to valero to satisfy the holders’ purchase contract obligations were retained by valero in full satisfaction of the holders’ obligations under the purchase contracts and were canceled on august 18 2003 the remaining 136 million of senior deferrable notes mature on august 18 2005 and bear an interest rate of 6797 valero in turn issued 49 million shares of its common stock at a price of 3495 per share in settlement of the 69 million purchase contracts equity on march 28 2003 valero sold in a public offering 63 million shares of its common stock at a price of 4025 per share and received net proceeds of 2503 million these shares were issued under valero’s shelf registration statement with the proceeds used to repay borrowings under valero’s revolving bank credit facilities in connection with the acquisition of the st charles refinery valero issued 10 million shares of 2 mandatory convertible preferred stock valero pays annual dividends of 050 for each share of convertible preferred stock when and if declared by its board of directors dividends are paid quarterly provided that dividends will not accrue or be payable with respect to a particular calendar quarter if valero does not declare a dividend on its common stock during that calendar quarter under common stock repurchase programs approved by valero’s board of directors valero repurchases shares of its common stock from time to time for use in connection with its employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes during 2003 valero repurchased shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of 732 million through february 2004 valero has not had any significant additional common share repurchases under these programs on february 5 2004 valero sold in a public offering 78 million shares of its common stock which included 10 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter at a price of 5325 per share and received proceeds net of underwriter’s discount and commissions of 4060 million these shares were issued under valero’s shelf registration statement to partially fund the acquisition of the aruba refinery and related operations pension plan funded status during 2003 valero contributed approximately 121 million to its qualified pension plans based on a 625 discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december 31 2003 the fair value of the assets in valero’s qualified plans were equal to approximately 68 of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2003 however the qualified plans were more than 90 funded based on their “current liability” which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations environmental matters valero is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment waste management pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters will increase in the future in addition any major upgrades in any of valero’s refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations for additional information regarding 47 

valero’s environmental matters including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental regulations see “environmental matters” in items 1  2 “business  properties” offbalance sheet arrangements accounts receivable sales facility as of december 31 2002 valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with a thirdparty financial institution to sell on a revolving basis up to 250 million of eligible trade and credit card receivables which matures in october 2005 in june 2003 valero amended its agreement to add two additional financial institutions to the program and to increase the size of its facility by 350 million to 600 million under this program wholly owned subsidiaries of valero sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables without recourse to the thirdparty financial institutions valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program as of december 31 2003 the amount of eligible receivables sold to the thirdparty financial institutions was 600 million structured lease arrangements as of december 31 2003 valero had various longterm operating lease commitments that were funded through structured lease arrangements with a financial institution the lessor which are summarized below in millions  

the lessor constructed or purchased the related assets and then leased them to valero the assets held by the lessor were funded through equity contributions of the lessor ranging from 3 to 5 of the fair market value of the asset and borrowings from other financial institutions neither valero its affiliates nor any related parties held any interest in the lessor for each lease valero had the option to purchase the leased assets at any time during the lease term for a price that approximated fair value valero has historically used these structured lease arrangements to provide additional liquidity to fund its ongoing operations however the cost of administering such structured lease arrangements has escalated over the years in large part due to more extensive and increasingly complex accounting rules related to such transactions recent accounting pronouncements including financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” which is discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements as well as speeches by representatives of organizations such as the securities and exchange commission and the fasb have emphasized the need for and the desirability of more transparency in reported financial information to achieve that objective new accounting pronouncements related to structured leases have become more complex and compliance with such pronouncements has become increasingly costly and burdensome valero desires to support the accounting profession’s objectives for enhanced transparency in financial reports and at the same time eliminate the ongoing and increasing costs inherent in ensuring that these arrangements continue to qualify for offbalance sheet treatment as a result in march 2004 valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties under each of its four existing structured lease 48 

arrangements and the leased properties were purchased through borrowings under valero’s existing bank credit facilities valero anticipates refinancing these amounts through the issuance in the near future of term notes at favorable rates if the purchase of the leased properties had occurred as of december 31 2003 valero’s outstanding debt would have increased by 531 million and valero’s debttocapitalization ratio would have been 435 as indicated above in the discussion of “other commercial commitments” valero believes that it has sufficient funds available from various sources to fund its ongoing operating requirements as a result valero does not believe that the above action will significantly affect its liquidity or its ability to fund its ongoing operations guarantees in connection with the sale of the golden eagle business valero guaranteed certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by tesoro which totaled approximately 40 million as of december 31 2003 this lease expires in 2010 new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or will become effective for valero’s financial statements at various dates in the future the adoption of these pronouncements has not had or is not expected to have a material effect on valero’s consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates the following summary provides further information about valero’s critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements which summarizes valero’s significant accounting policies inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing and produced products are determined under the lastin firstout lifo method of inventory pricing the cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weightedaverage cost method valero utilizes the dollarvalue lifo method and uses average purchase prices during the year to value any increments to its lifo inventory property plant and equipment valero records depreciation expense on its property plant and equipment using the composite method of depreciation under the composite method of depreciation the costs of minor property units net of salvage value retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation while gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in income accounting for property plant and equipment requires various judgments and estimates including a determination of remaining useful lives salvage values and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and losses in june 2001 the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop entitled “accounting for certain costs and activities related to property plant and equipment” which addressed accounting for depreciation and replacement of property plant and equipment the exposure draft concluded that component accounting for a replacement of property 49 

plant and equipment should occur at the time of replacement if an entity replaces part of a property plant and equipment asset that has not previously been accounted for as a component and the replacement meets the definition of a component then the entity should capitalize the cost of the replacement account for it as a separate component estimate the net book value of the replaced item and charge the net book value of the replaced item to depreciation expense in the period of replacement therefore a consequence of not previously applying component accounting is that the net book value of the replaced item is charged to depreciation expense in the period of the replacement with net book value calculated using the expected useful life of the total property plant and equipment asset to which the component relates in addition if the provisions of the exposure draft are enacted and component rather than composite accounting is required significant additional estimates and judgments will be required due to the additional volume of assets to be accounted for individually the proposed sop is expected to be considered for approval by the fasb in april 2004 if the proposed sop is approved its provisions would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2004 impairment of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets longlived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired intangible assets that have finite useful lives should be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value in order to test for recoverability management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include but are not limited to assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset estimated remaining life of the asset and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things an assessment of market conditions projected cash flows investment rates interestequity rates and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the longlived asset goodwill and other intangible assets due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future thus affecting valero’s earnings refinery turnaround costs refinery turnaround costs which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at valero’s refineries are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straightline basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs the frequency of refinery turnarounds varies with each refinery operating unit as of december 31 2003 valero had 1923 million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet the aicpa’s exposure draft of a proposed sop entitled “accounting for certain costs and activities related to property plant and equipment” discussed above under “property plant and equipment” also addressed accounting for the costs of planned major maintenance activities the exposure draft concluded that the total cost of planned major maintenance activities cannot be deferred but that the individual costs incurred in such planned major maintenance activities should be evaluated to determine if they represent the acquisition of additional components or the replacement of existing components all other costs incurred in a planned major maintenance activity should be charged to expense as incurred if the provisions of the exposure draft are enacted and turnaround costs are ultimately expensed as incurred valero’s reported income would become more volatile the proposed sop is expected to be considered for approval by the fasb in april 2004 if 50 

the proposed sop is approved its provisions would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2004 income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements valero must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income to the extent valero believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets valero has recorded a valuation allowance as of december 31 2003 and 2002 due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits carried forward before they expire the valuation allowance is based on valero’s estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable if actual results differ from the estimates or valero adjusts the estimates in future periods valero may need to revise the valuation allowance the net deferred income tax assets as of december 31 2003 were 6001 million net of a valuation allowance of 826 million asset retirement obligations effective january 1 2003 valero adopted statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost an entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made in order to determine fair value management must make certain estimates and assumptions including among other things projected cash flows a creditadjusted riskfree rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation these estimates and assumptions are very subjective however valero believes it has adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the effect of valero’s adoption of statement no 143 environmental liabilities valero’s operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment waste management and pollution prevention measures future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations as well as valero’s own internal environmental policies valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its environmental exposures however environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible contamination the timing and extent of remediation the determination of valero’s liability in proportion to other parties improvements in cleanup technologies and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may change in the future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside valero’s control for example the discount rate assumption is based on moody’s published aa corporate bond rate as of the end of each year while the expected return on plan 51 

assets is based on a compounded return calculated for valero by an outside consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through 2001 with an asset allocation of 65 equities and 35 bonds representative of the asset mix in valero’s qualified pension plans these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in valero’s consolidated financial statements for example a 025 decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 025 increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2003 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2004 in millions  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations in order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and natural gas purchases and refined product sales cash flow hedges in addition valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales finally valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions see “derivative instruments” in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions the types of instruments used in valero’s hedging and trading activities described above include swaps futures and options valero’s positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with valero’s stated risk management policy which has been approved by valero’s board of directors 52 

the following tables provide information about valero’s derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2003 and 2002 dollars in millions except for the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including    contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the weightedaverage pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million british thermal units for natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements the gain loss on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes for futures and options the gain loss represents i the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions or ii the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions additionally for futures and options the weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weightedaverage receive price represents the contract price for short positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for options represents their strike price 53 

 

 

interest rate risk valero’s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to its longterm debt obligations valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt in addition valero utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixedrate debt to floating rate these interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and longterm debt balances are adjusted accordingly in connection with the uds acquisition valero assumed certain interest rate swap agreements entered into by uds in order to manage interest rate exposure on certain fixedrate debt obligations these agreements which were all terminated in early 2003 were accounted for as speculative transactions the following table provides information about valero’s longterm debt and interest rate derivative instruments in millions except interest rates all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates for longterm debt principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented for interest rate swaps the table presents notional amounts and weightedaverage interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract weightedaverage floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date  

 

foreign currency risk valero enters into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its canadian operations changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge during may 2002 valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its canadian operations that valero intended to redeem in the future under these contracts valero sold 400 million of canadian dollars and bought 2534 million of us dollars the following tables present the notional amounts of these contracts by expected contractual maturity dates and the total fair value of the contracts as of december 31 2003 and 2002 in millions  

 

in february 2004 valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its canadian operations as a result valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by valero of approximately 34 million with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts as of december 31 2003 valero had other commitments to purchase 167 million of us dollars and sell 67 million of us dollars valero’s market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before january 9 2004 57

district  court  central  district of california  filed january 22 2002  in
2002  union oil company of  california  unocal  sued valero  alleging  patent
infringement  the  complaint  seeks  a 575  cent  per  gallon  royalty  on all
reformulated  gasoline  infringing  on  unocals  393 and 126  patents  these
patents cover certain  compositions of cleanerburning  gasoline  the complaint
seeks  treble  damages for valeros  alleged  willful  infringement  of unocals
patents and valeros  alleged  conduct to induce others to infringe the patents
in a previous lawsuit  involving its 393 patent  unocal prevailed against five
other  major  refiners  in  2001  the ftc  began  an  antitrust  investigation
concerning unocals conduct with a joint industry research group during the time
that unocal was prosecuting its patents at the us patent and trademark  office
pto  on march 4  2003  the ftc  announced  that it was  filing a  complaint
against unocal for antitrust violations the ftcs complaint seeks an injunction
against any future patent enforcement  activity by unocal  each of the 393 and
126  patents is being  reexamined  by the pto  the pto has  issued  notices of
rejection of all claims of each of these patents  these  rejections are subject
to additional proceedings  including  administrative appeal by unocal followed
by an  appeal  in  federal  district  court or the  court of  appeals  ultimate
invalidation  would  preclude  unocal from pursuing  claims based on the 393 or
126 patents unocals patent lawsuit against valero is indefinitely stayed as a
result  of the  pto  reexamination  proceedings  notwithstanding  the  judgment
against the other refiners in the previous  litigation  valero believes that it
has several strong  defenses to unocals  lawsuit  including those arising from
unocals  misconduct  and  valero  believes  it will  prevail  in the  lawsuit
however  due  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  litigation  there  can be no
assurance that valero will prevail  and an adverse result could have a material
adverse effect on valeros results of operations and financial position

     mtbe litigation

valero  is  a  defendant  in  various  cases  alleging  mtbe   contamination  in
groundwater in new york and  california  the plaintiffs  generally  allege that
refiners  and   manufacturers  of  gasoline   containing  mtbe  are  liable  for
manufacturing a defective product  in california  the lawsuits have been filed
by local water providers including the city of santa monica the city of dinuba
and fruitridge vista water company in new york a lawsuit has been filed by the
suffolk  county water  authority  these cases are primarily  based on a product
liabilityproduct defect theory and seek individual  unquantified  compensatory
and punitive  damages and attorneys  fees  valero believes it is unlikely that
the final outcome of any one of these suits filed by local water providers would
have a  material  adverse  effect on its  results  of  operations  or  financial
position  but that an adverse  result in a majority of these cases could have a
material  adverse  effect  on  valeros  results  of  operations  and  financial
position

facilities  in  colorado  in 1992  conoco and crc  received a joint  notice of
additional  work  requiring  the companies to install  interim  measures to meet
state groundwater  standards at sand creek down gradient from both refineries
in 1998 conoco and crc received  duplicate orders from cdphe and epa to install

notices of civil administrative  penalty assessments orders from february 2002
to december 2002 for alleged  noncompliance  with certain njdep emission  limits

and notices of civil administrative  penalty assessments in the aggregate amount
of 318300 from the njdep  the  penalties  are for alleged  failures to repair
certain  leak  detection  points in the  refinery  within the 15day  regulatory

quarter of 2002  valero has  asserted  certain  defenses  to the orders and has
taken certain corrective actions with respect to these incidents

     other litigation

valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary  course of  business  valero  believes it is  unlikely  that the final
outcome of any of the claims or  proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material  adverse  effect on its  financial  position  results of operations or
liquidity  however due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation the range of
any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable  degree of precision and
valero cannot provide  assurance that the resolution of any particular  claim or
proceeding  would not have an  adverse  effect  on its  results  of  operations
financial position or liquidity

general

valeros net income for the year ended december 31 2002 was 915  million  or
083 per share  compared to net income of 5636 million  or 883 per share
for the year ended december 31 2001  for the fourth quarter of 2002  valeros
net income was 890 million or 081 per share  compared to 516 million or
082 per share  for the fourth quarter of 2001  since the uds acquisition was
completed on december 31 2001  the  operations of uds were not included in the
2001  results  in  addition  since the huntway and el paso  acquisitions  were
completed on june 1 2001 the  operations  related to those  acquisitions  were
included in 2001 results for only the last seven months of 2001

operating revenues increased 80 for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result
of the additional  throughput volumes from the refinery  operations  acquired in
the uds el paso and huntway  acquisitions and the additional revenues generated
from the retail operations acquired in the uds acquisition  partially offset by
a decline in refined product prices however operating income for 2002 declined
5305 million  or 53 from the 10 billion  reported in 2001 due mainly to a
5184  million  decrease in operating  income from the  refining  segment and a
1387  million  increase  in   administrative   expenses   including   related
depreciation  and  amortization  expense  partially  offset by an  increase of
1266 million in operating  income from the retail segment  attributable to the
retail operations acquired in the uds acquisition

operating income for 2002 benefited from synergies that were created as a result
of the merger  between  valero and uds the combined  company  benefited in 2002
from  gross  margin   improvements   and  from   reductions   in  operating  and
administrative expenses the improvement in gross margin resulted primarily from
a reduction in inventory levels yield optimization and procurement initiatives
operating  and  administrative  expense  synergies  were  achieved  mainly  from
incorporating best practices between the two companies and eliminating  salaries
and benefits associated with former uds executives and other employees

refining

operating  income for valeros  refining  segment declined from 11608 million
for the year  ended  december  31  2001 to 6424  million  for the year  ended
december 31 2002  the decrease in refining  segment  operating  income was due
principally to a 34 decline in the throughput margin per barrel attributable to
depressed sour crude oil discounts and lower refined  product  margins in all of
valeros markets

during  2002  refining  operating  results  were  negatively  impacted  by  the
following factors
     o    discounts on valeros sour crude oil  feedstocks  during 2002 declined
          approximately  50 from 2001 levels  primarily due to opecs crude oil
          production cuts in 2002  which limited the availability of sour crude
          oil on  the  world  market  whereas  2001  benefited  from  increased
          supplies  of sour  crude  oil  while  demand  for  sweeter  crude  oil
          increased  to meet  lower  sulfur  requirements  for  certain  refined
          products
     o    gasoline and distillate margins declined  significantly in all regions
          of the united  states from 2001 to 2002 due to high  inventory  levels
          for these  products as a result of an  increase  in gasoline  imports
          increased  gasoline  production   particularly  in  california   an
          unusually  warm winter in the  northeastern  part of the united states
          and in europe  and lower jet fuel demand  although  gasoline  demand
          increased  during the year high imports of gasoline kept  inventories
          at abovenormal levels and
     o    valeros  refinery  utilization  rates  were  significantly  below its
          normal  operating  rates  during  2002 as  eight  of  valeros  twelve
          refineries were affected by turnaround activities  in addition to the
          scheduled  downtime  valero also  experienced  significant  unplanned
          maintenance at its  refineries  during 2002 and production at most of
          its  refineries  was reduced at various  times  during the year due to
          uneconomic operating conditions
the above decreases in refining  operating  income were partially  offset by the
increased  throughput  volumes  resulting  from  the  uds  huntway  and el paso
acquisitions  an  approximate  net  76  million  benefit  resulting  from  the
settlement in june and august 2002 of petroleum products purchase agreements and
related hedges and a 39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of its
lifo inventories

refining cash  operating  expenses and refining  depreciation  and  amortization
expense were 57 and 70 higher  respectively  for the year ended december 31
2002 compared to the year ended  december 31 2001 as a result of the additional
refinery  operations  from the uds el paso and huntway  acquisitions  however
these operating costs on a per barrel basis remained stable from 2001 to 2002

retail

retail  operating income was 1285 million for the year ended december 31 2002
compared to 19 million for the year ended  december 31 2001  the 2002 retail
operating income includes both the us and northeast retail operations acquired
in the uds  acquisition  the 2001 retail  operations  included only 11 northern
california retail stores operated by valero at that time

during 2002 pursuant to a plan adopted in conjunction with the uds acquisition
valero  implemented  various  changes in its retail  operations  that  benefited
results in 2002 and are  expected  to further  benefit  future  results  for the
retail segment  as part of these changes  76 stores were reimaged and upgraded
in 2002 these changes also included the closure or divestiture of approximately
160 stores and the  identification  of an  additional  150 stores for closure or
divestiture  gains or losses on closed or divested stores will be recognized to
the extent of the  difference  between any net proceeds  received on disposition
and the net book value of each store  since the value  assigned to these stores
was  established  as part of the final  purchase  price  allocation  for the uds
acquisition and due to the short period of time between the uds acquisition and
the  actual  or  planned  disposition  any  gains or  losses  have been and are
expected to be insignificant

retail cash selling expenses and retail  depreciation  and amortization  expense
for the year ended december 31 2002 were significantly  higher than 2001 due to
the additional retail stores acquired in the uds acquisition

corporate expenses and other

administrative  expenses   including  depreciation  and  amortization  expense
increased  1387  million for the year ended  december 31 2002 compared to the
year ended  december 31 2001  the  increase  was due  primarily to  additional
administrative  expenses  resulting  from the uds  acquisition  and increases in
employee  salaries and benefits and professional  services  partially offset by
reduced  variable  compensation  expense  as a  result  of the  lower  level  of
operating  income  recognized  during  2002  and  the  nonrecurrence  in 2002 of
integration and early  retirement  costs incurred in 2001 in connection with the
uds  acquisition  for the year ended  december  31 2001  cash  administrative
expenses  for  the  combined  operations  of uds  and  valero  would  have  been
approximately  323 million compared to approximately  282 million for the year
ended december 31 2002 the reduction in cash  administrative  expenses was due
mainly to synergies resulting from the uds acquisition  primarily  attributable
to  the  elimination  of  salaries  and  benefits  associated  with  former  uds
executives and other employees

other income expense net increased 132 million from expense of 46 million
for the year ended  december  31  2001 to income of 86  million  for the year
ended  december  31 2002 due  primarily  to a 70  million  increase in equity
income from valeros  investments in joint ventures and 59 million of interest
income related to the  amortization of the discount on the notes receivable from
tesoro in connection with the sale of the golden eagle business

net  interest  and debt  expense  increased  1972  million  for the year ended
december 31 2002 compared to the year ended  december 31 2001 due primarily to
interest expense on borrowings  incurred to finance the uds acquisition  coupled
with interest expense  incurred on the debt assumed in the uds  acquisition  as
well  as  the  fullyear  effect  of  interest  expense  on  the  capital  lease
obligations associated with the june 1 2001 el paso acquisition

the minority interest in net income of consolidated partnership of 141 million
represents the minority unitholders share of the net income of valero lp

distributions  on preferred  securities of subsidiary  trusts increased to 300
million for the year ended  december  31  2002 from 134  million for the year
ended december 31 2001 due to the distributions incurred on the 200 million of
832 trust originated preferred securities assumed in the uds acquisition

income tax expense decreased 2731 million from 2001 to 2002 mainly as a result
of lower operating income and higher interest expense  the effective income tax
rate was 39 for 2002 compared to 37 for 2001 due to the impact of the canadian
operations acquired in the uds acquisition

valero utilizes the financial measure of earnings before interest income taxes
depreciation and amortization ebitda which is not defined under united states
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  management  presents ebitda in its
filings  under  the  securities  exchange  act of 1934 and its  press  releases
management uses this financial measure because it is a widely accepted financial
indicator used by some  investors and analysts to analyze and compare  companies
on the  basis of  operating  performance  in  addition  ebitda  is used in the
computation of certain debt covenant  ratios  included in valeros  various debt
agreements  ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the period  nor
is it presented as an  alternative  to operating  income or income before income
taxes it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure
of  performance  prepared in accordance  with united states  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  valeros method of computation of ebitda may or may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies

general

valeros net income was 5636 million  or 883 per share  for the year ended
december 31 2001 compared to net income of 3391 million  or 560 per share
for the year ended december 31 2000

operating revenues increased 3172 million or 2 to 150 billion during 2001
compared to 2000 due primarily to a 19 increase in average daily sales volumes
offset to a large  extent  by a 14  decrease  in the  average  sales  price per
barrel the increase in average daily sales volumes was due primarily to i the
fullyear  effect of volumes  attributable to the benicia  acquisition  ii an
increase in the sale of feedstocks and products  purchased for resale and iii
higher  throughput  volumes  resulting from the  contribution of the el paso and
huntway  refineries  acquired  in  the  second  quarter  of  2001  and  capacity
expansions at the texas city and other  refineries  during 2001 the decrease in
average sales prices was due primarily to lower refined product prices resulting
from increased refined product inventories industrywide and a decrease in crude
oil prices  operating income increased 3904 million  or 64 to 10 billion
during 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to a 4191 million or 57 increase
in  operating  income from the  refining  segment  partially  offset by a 298
million increase in administrative  expenses including related depreciation and
amortization expense

refining

operating income for valeros  refining segment increased to 12 billion during
the year ended  december 31 2001 compared to 7417  million for the year ended
december  31 2000 due  primarily  to a 21  increase in  throughput  margin per
barrel  partially  offset by a 2248  million  increase in refining  operating
expenses including depreciation and amortization expense during 2001 refining
operating results benefited from the following factors

     o    the  fullyear   contribution  from  the  benicia   acquisition  which
          increased operating income by approximately 66 million

                                       37
page
     o    increased  throughput  volumes  resulting from the huntway and el paso
          acquisitions  completed  in june 2001 and capacity  expansions  of the
          crude oil units at the texas city refinery completed in february 2001
     o    a significant  improvement in sour crude oil discounts  resulting from
          an increase in supplies of heavier  crude oil while demand for sweeter
          crude oil  increased  to meet lower  sulfur  requirements  for certain
          refined products
     o    higher  lube  oil  margins   resulting  mainly  from  improved  market
          conditions
     o    higher prices for no6 fuel oil and other heavy  products  relative to
          crude oil prices and
     o    recognition of an 88 million benefit attributable to the acquisition
          of uds  inventories  on december  31 2001 as  discussed  in note 5 of
          notes to consolidated financial statements
partially  offsetting  the above  increases in  operating  income were i lower
distillate margins  when compared to exceptionally high margins in 2000 due to
strong demand and extremely low industry inventory levels in 2000 resulting from
cold weather and high natural gas prices which caused power  producers to switch
to fuel oil to run their  plants  ii a  significant  decrease  in margins for
propylene and other petrochemical feedstocks to negative levels in 2001 due to
slowing economic activity throughout the world and iii an increase in natural
gas hydrogen and methanol feedstock costs relative to crude oil

refining  cash  operating  expenses were 1628  million  higher during the year
ended  december  31  2001  compared  to the year ended  december  31  2000 due
primarily to the operations of the corpus christi  refinery and related  refined
product  logistics  business  acquired  from el paso in 2001  and  increases  in
employee salaries benefits and variable compensation  maintenance costs and ad
valorem  taxes  partially  offset by reduced  refinery  energy costs  refining
depreciation  and amortization  expense  increased by 620 million from 2000 to
2001 due mainly to an increase  in  turnaround  and  catalyst  amortization  and
increased  depreciation  expense  resulting from the 2001  acquisition of the el
paso facilities and capital expansion projects

corporate expenses and other

administrative  expenses   including  depreciation  and  amortization  expense
increased  298  million  as a result  of an  increase  in  employee  salaries
benefits and variable  compensation  and integration and early retirement costs
incurred in 2001 in connection with the uds  acquisition  partially  offsetting
these  increases in  administrative  expenses was the  nonrecurrence  in 2001 of
costs recorded in 2000 associated with certain litigation and other matters

other income  expense  net decreased 49 million from income of 03 million
during 2000 to expense of 46 million  during 2001 due to lower  equity  income
from valeros 20 equity interest in the javelina  offgas  processing  plant in
corpus christi the javelina plants results were impacted by higher natural gas
feedstock  costs and lower product prices  resulting  from a weak  petrochemical
market  partially  offsetting the reduced  results from the javelina plant were
lower costs related to the agreement entered into by valero in september 1999 to
sell a portion of its accounts receivable

net interest and debt expense increased 122 million from 2000 to 2001 due to a
full year of interest  expense  during 2001 on  borrowings  incurred to fund the
benicia acquisition including interest on the senior notes issued in june 2000
and interest expense recognized on the capital lease obligations associated with
the el paso  acquisition  partially  offset by a  decrease  in bank  borrowings
resulting from valeros earnings and cash flow during 2001

distributions  on preferred  securities of subsidiary  trust increased from 68
million in 2000 to 134 million in 2001 due to a full year of  distributions on
the peps  units  issued in june 2000 in  connection  with  funding  the  benicia
acquisition

income tax expense  increased  from 1891  million in 2000 to 3313 million in
2001 due primarily to the significant  increase in pretax income the effective
income tax rate was 37 for 2001  compared  to 36 for 2000 due to the impact of
higher state income taxes in 2001

outlook

during late january and early february of 2003  domestic crude oil  inventories
declined to one of their lowest  levels since 1976  this low level of crude oil
inventories  combined with the impact that the national oil workers  strike in
venezuela had on crude oil and other feedstock supplies in the market  resulted
in a  significant  narrowing of sour crude oil  discounts and resulted in higher
overall feedstock costs  this in turn caused sweet crude oil and intermediate
feedstock  processing economics to be unfavorable and various refineries reduced
production  valero reduced its refinery operating rates by as much as 15 early
in the first quarter of 2003  since early february  the crude oil fundamentals
have improved with higher opec production  levels and the partial  resumption of
venezuelan  crude oil exports  the increased  availability of sour crude oil on
world markets since early  february has also resulted in a significant  widening
in sour crude oil discounts

in regard to refined  products  the  industry  production  cuts  caused by poor
refining margins early in the first quarter of 2003  combined with a very large
number of scheduled  turnarounds  throughout the refining industry  resulted in
lower gasoline and distillate  production  which contributed to a steep decline
in gasoline and distillate inventories in addition the extreme cold weather in
the  northeast  united states and eastern  canada  further  impacted  distillate
inventories in addition to the reduction of supply the venezuelan oil workers
strike  resulted  in an  increased  demand for us  refined  products  by latin
american and caribbean countries  much of which is being supplied from the gulf
coast and the west coast including increased shipments from valero

although  gasoline  margins in  california  remained  weak in early  2003  carb
gasoline margins  increased from  approximately 7 per barrel at the end of 2002
to over 20 per barrel by early march 2003 this strength in west coast refining
margins is expected  to continue as the supply of carb  gasoline is reduced as a
result of turnarounds  the effect of lower rvp restrictions  effective march 1
and a switch by several  west  coast  refiners  to carb  gasoline  blended  with
ethanol

as the effects of low inventory levels  the venezuelan  strike  continued cold
weather and turnaround activity have made their impact on the markets  refining
economics have improved significantly  in late february valero raised refinery
production  levels back to normal levels as a result of higher refining margins
during  2003   valero  expects  refined   product   inventories  to  remain  at
belowaverage levels which should support continued strong refining margins in
addition valero anticipates that the current favorable supply and demand trends




                                       39
page
should  support  continued  wide sour crude oil  discounts  unlike  much of the
refining  industry  valero has a light schedule of turnaround  activity  during
2003 due to the anticipated  improvement in refining  fundamentals  and the low
number of scheduled  turnarounds  as well as expected income contributions from
strategic projects completed during 2002 and additional  synergies expected from
the uds  acquisition  valero expects that 2003 net income will be significantly
higher than 2002

liquidity and capital resources

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2002
net cash provided by operating  activities  for the year ended december 31 2002
was 2723  million  compared to 9055  million for the year ended december 31
2001 a decrease of 6332  million  the decrease in cash provided by operating
activities  was due primarily to the  unfavorable  change in income as described
above under results of operations and an 801 million  increase in the amount
of cash used to fund working capital and deferred  charges and credits  changes
in working capital for the year ended december 31 2002 included
     o    a significant  increase in accounts  receivable  and accounts  payable
          resulting  from increased  commodity  prices from december 31 2001 to
          december 31 2002
     o    an increase in  receivables  of  approximately  200  million due to a
          reduction in the amount of receivables  sold under  valeros  accounts
          receivable sales facility
     o    the receipt of approximately  141 million of income tax refunds  net
          of payments and
     o    a  decrease  in  accrued   expenses  as  a  result  of  payments   for
          changeincontrol  benefits to former uds  employees and a decrease in
          employee bonuses

valeros investing  activities for the year ended december 31 2002 provided net
cash of 2486 million  valeros investing  activities  included the receipt of
3009 million from the liquidation of its investment in the diamondkoch  joint

offset  by  payments  of  8034  million  for  capital  expenditures  deferred
turnaround  and catalyst costs and earnout  payments and net cash  requirements
related to the golden eagle business of 1835 million

resulting increase of 1095 million in valeros cash balance

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2001
net cash provided by operating  activities  increased  3042  million to 9055
million during 2001 compared to 2000 due mainly to the  significant  increase in
net income discussed above under results of operations partially offset by an
increase  in the  amount  of cash used to fund  working  capital  during  2001
approximately 11 billion of cash was generated from earnings  of which 1812
million  was used for other  operating  activities  primarily  working  capital
requirements  during  2001  accounts  payable  decreased  2376  million  and
accounts  receivable  decreased  1221  million  primarily  due to a decline in
various  commodity prices from december 2000 to december 2001  partially offset
by an increase in volumes purchased and sold accounts payable also declined due
to  valeros  redelivery  to the us  strategic  petroleum  reserve  in 2001 of
approximately  one million barrels of crude oil in settlement of a time exchange
of crude oil entered into in 2000

valeros investing activities for the year ended december 31 2001 used net cash

in september  2002  valero amended the interest  coverage ratio covenant in its
various bank credit facilities and structured lease arrangements  the amendment
provides that valeros trailing fourquarter interest coverage ratio must not be
less than
     o    24 times for the  fourth  quarter  of 2002 and the first  quarter  of
          2003
     o    25 times for the second third and fourth quarters of 2003 and
     o    275 times thereafter

in november 2002  valero renewed its 750 million 364day revolving bank credit
facility

under valeros revolving bank credit facilities valeros debttocapitalization
ratio net of cash was 504 as of  december  31  2002  for  purposes of this
computation  50 of the  200  million  of  832  trust  originated  preferred
securities  assumed  in the uds  acquisition  and 20 of the  1725  million of
aggregate liquidation amount of trust preferred securities issued as part of the
peps units were included as debt

as of  december  31  2002  valero  had  1471  million  of  letters of credit
outstanding  under its  uncommitted  shortterm  bank credit  facilities  998
million of letters of credit  outstanding  under its  committed  facilities  and
cdn64 million of letters of credit outstanding under its canadian facility

in march 2003  the  revolving  credit  facility  for valero lp was amended to
increase the borrowing capacity to 175 million

valero  believes  it has  sufficient  funds from  operations  and to the extent
necessary from the public and private capital markets and bank markets to fund
its  ongoing  operating  requirements   valero  expects  that  to  the  extent
necessary  it can raise  additional  funds from time to time through  equity or
debt financings  however there can be no assurances regarding the availability
of any future  financings or whether such  financings  can be made  available on
terms acceptable to valero

valeros refining and marketing  operations have a concentration of customers in
the refining  industry and customers  who are refined  product  wholesalers  and
retailers  these  concentrations  of  customers  may  impact  valeros  overall
exposure  to  credit  risk  either  positively  or  negatively  in that  these
customers may be similarly  affected by changes in economic or other conditions
however   valero  believes  that  its  portfolio  of  accounts   receivable  is
sufficiently  diversified to the extent  necessary to minimize  potential credit
risk  historically  valero has not had any significant problems collecting its
accounts receivable

valero  repurchases  shares  of its  common  stock  from time to time for use in
connection with its employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes
during 2002 valero  repurchased shares of its common stock under these programs
at a cost of  455  million  through  february  2003  valero  has not had any
significant additional common share repurchases under these programs

environmental matters
valero is subject to extensive federal  state and local  environmental laws and
regulations  including  those  relating to the discharge of materials  into the
environment waste management pollution prevention measures and characteristics
and  composition of gasoline and  distillates  because  environmental  laws and
regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new  environmental  laws
and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed  the level of future
expenditures  required for environmental matters will increase in the future in
addition  any  major  upgrades  in any of  valeros  refineries  could  require
material   additional   expenditures  to  comply  with  environmental  laws  and
regulations   for  additional   information  regarding  valeros  environmental
matters including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental
regulations see environmental matters in items 1  2 business  properties

accounts receivable sales facility
in connection with the uds acquisition  valero assumed a 360 million revolving
accounts  receivable  sales  facility  under which valero  could sell  eligible
credit card and trade  accounts  receivable on an ongoing basis through a wholly
owned  subsidiary to a  thirdparty  financial  institution  valero also had an
existing  accounts  receivable  sales  facility  with  a  thirdparty  financial
institution  to sell on a revolving  basis up to 100 million of eligible  trade
accounts  receivable as of december 31 2001 which was increased during 2002 to
150 million  on october 8 2002  valero renewed and amended its agreement to
among other things  increase the size of its facility from 150 million to 250
million  incorporate  credit card  receivables  into the program and extend the
maturity  date to october  2005  the assumed uds  facility  was  terminated  in
connection with the renewal and amendment of the valero facility under valeros
program  a wholly owned  subsidiary  of valero  sells an  undivided  percentage
ownership  interest  in  the  eligible  receivables   without  recourse  to  a
thirdparty financial institution  valero remains responsible for servicing the
transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables
under the program  as of december 31 2002 the amount of eligible  receivables
sold to the thirdparty financial institution was 250 million

structured lease arrangements
as  of  december  31  2002  valero  had  various  longterm   operating  lease
commitments  that have been funded through  structured lease  arrangements  with
nonconsolidated thirdparty entities which are summarized below in millions

valero  entered  into  these  structured  lease  arrangements  with  thirdparty
entities that  constructed  or purchased the related assets and then leased them
to valero  the assets held by these  thirdparty  entities were funded  through
borrowings by these  entities and equity  contributions  equal to at least 3 of
the asset cost  neither valero its affiliates nor any related parties hold any
interest in these  entities  for each lease  valero has the option to purchase
the  leased  assets  at  any  time  during  the  lease  term  for a  price  that
approximates  fair  value  after the  initial  lease  term  the  leases may be
extended by agreement of the parties  in the case of the headquarters  facility
lease  if valero  exercises its renewal  option at the end of the primary lease
term  valero will be required to provide cash  collateral in an amount equal to
the residual value guarantee  which is currently  estimated to be approximately
146 million  the various  structured lease  arrangements also permit valero to
sell the  leased  properties  to one or more  third  parties  in which case the
leases provide for maximum residual value guarantees  ranging from 82 to 87 of
the  appraised  value of the leased  properties at the end of the lease term as
determined at the inception of the lease

valero uses these structured lease arrangements to provide additional  liquidity
to fund its ongoing  operations  except for the proposed  purchase of an office
building that is subject to a lease that expires in april 2003  valero believes
that it is not  reasonably  likely that it will purchase  these leased assets at
any time during their lease terms and would likely renew  to the extent that it
can the leases for such assets under similar arrangements  however  there can
be  no  assurance   regarding  the  availability  of  future   structured  lease
arrangements  or  whether  such  arrangements  can be made  available  on  terms
acceptable to valero see note 1 of notes to consolidated  financial  statements
for a  discussion  of fasb  interpretation  no 46  consolidation  of variable
interest entities and its potential effect on valeros consolidated  financial
statements

guarantees
in  connection  with the sale of the golden eagle  business  valero  guaranteed
certain lease payment  obligations  related to an mtbe facility lease assumed by
tesoro which totaled approximately 46 million as of december 31 2002

valeros  structured  lease  arrangements  provide  for maximum  residual  value
guarantees  ranging  from  82  to  87 of the  appraised  value  of the  leased
properties  at the end of the lease term  as determined at the inception of the
lease as of december 31 2002 the maximum residual value guarantee on valeros
structured lease arrangments was approximately 541 million

new accounting pronouncements

as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated  financial  statements  certain
new  financial  accounting  pronouncements  have been issued  which  either have
already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or
will become effective for valeros financial  statements at various dates in the
future the adoption of these  pronouncements has not had or is not expected to
have a material effect on valeros consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies

the  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with united  states
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes  actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates  the following  summary provides further  information  about valeros
critical  accounting  policies and should be read in conjunction  with note 1 of
notes  to  consolidated   financial   statements   which  summarizes   valeros
significant accounting policies

inventories
inventories  are  stated at the lower of cost or  market  the cost of  refinery
feedstocks  purchased for processing and produced  products are determined under
the  lastin  firstout  lifo  method  of  inventory  pricing  the  cost  of
feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials supplies
and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted average cost
method  valero utilizes the dollarvalue  lifo method and uses average purchase
prices during the year to value any increments to its lifo inventory

property plant and equipment
valero records depreciation  expense on its property  plant and equipment using
the  composite   method  of   depreciation   under  the  composite   method  of
depreciation  the costs of minor property units net of salvage value  retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated  depreciation while gains or
losses on sales or other  dispositions  of major  units are  recorded in income
accounting  for property  plant and equipment  requires  various  judgments and
estimates  including a determination of remaining useful lives  salvage values
and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and
losses

in june 2001 the american  institute of certified  public  accountants  aicpa
issued an exposure  draft of a proposed  statement  of position  sop  entitled
accounting  for certain  costs and  activities  related to property  plant and
equipment in which  accounting for  depreciation  and replacement of property
plant and equipment was addressed  the exposure draft  concluded that component
accounting  for a replacement of property  plant and equipment  should occur at
the time of  replacement  if an entity  replaces part of a property  plant and
equipment asset that has not previously  been accounted for as a component  and
the  replacement  meets the  definition  of a component  then the entity should
capitalize the cost of the replacement  account for it as a separate component
estimate the net book value of the replaced  item and charge the net book value
of the  replaced  item to  depreciation  expense in the  period of  replacement
therefore a consequence of not previously applying component accounting is that
the net book value of the replaced  item is charged to  depreciation  expense in
the period of the replacement with net book value calculated using the expected
useful  life of the  total  property  plant  and  equipment  asset to which the
component  relates  in addition  if the  provisions of the exposure  draft are
enacted and component rather than composite accounting is required  significant
additional estimates and judgments will be required due to the additional volume
of assets to be accounted for  individually  in february 2003 the fasb and the
aicpa met to deliberate  certain  aspects of the proposed sop the status of the
proposed  sop remains  unchanged  valero is unable to  estimate  when or if the
proposed sop will be enacted

goodwill and other intangible assets
in  connection  with the uds  acquisition  valero  recognized  goodwill of 26
billion and intangible assets of approximately 279 million  fasb statement no
142   goodwill   and  other   intangible   assets   requires  that  goodwill
andintangible  assets that have indefinite useful lives are not to be amortized
but instead must be tested for impairment  annually or more frequently if events
or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  asset  might  be  impaired
intangible  assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized
and  should  be  reviewed  for   impairment   whenever   events  or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of the  asset  may  not be
recoverable

impairment  testing  requires that an entity determine the fair value of each of
its reporting  units  in order to determine  fair value  management  must make
certain estimates and assumptions  including  among other things an assessment
of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interestequity
rates and growth rates  that could  significantly  impact the reported value of
goodwill and other intangible assets due to the significant subjectivity of the
assumptions  used to determine  the fair value of a reporting  unit  changes in
market conditions could result in significant  impairment charges in the future
thus affecting valeros earnings

refinery turnaround costs
refinery  turnaround costs  which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance  activities at valeros  refineries  are deferred when incurred and
amortized on a  straightline  basis over the period of time  estimated to lapse
until the next turnaround occurs  the frequency of refinery  turnarounds varies
with each refinery  operating  unit as of december 31 2002  valero had 1850
million of refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet

the aicpas  exposure draft of a proposed sop entitled  accounting  for certain
costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment discussed above
under property  pland and equipment also addressed  accounting for the costs
of planned major maintenance  activities  the exposure draft concluded that the
total cost of planned major maintenance  activities cannot be deferred but that
the  individual  costs  incurred in such planned  major  maintenance  activities
should be evaluated to determine if they represent the acquisition of additional
components or the replacement of existing  components  all other costs incurred
in a  planned  major  maintenance  activity  should be  charged  to  expense  as
incurred  if the  provisions of the exposure  draft are enacted and  turnaround
costs are ultimately expensed as incurred valeros reported income would become
more  volatile  in  february  2003  the fasb and the aicpa  met to  deliberate
certain  aspects of the  proposed  sop  the status of the  proposed sop remains
unchanged  valero is unable to  estimate  when or if the  proposed  sop will be
enacted  management of valero  estimates that if the provisions of the exposure
draft had been applicable  during 2002  valeros reported net income would have
been reduced by approximately 33 million for the year ended december 31 2002

income taxes
as part of the process of preparing  consolidated  financial statements  valero
must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered
through future taxable  income  to the extent valero  believes that recovery is
not likely a valuation  allowance must be established  significant  management
judgment is required in determining  any valuation  allowance  recorded  against
deferred  income tax assets  valero has  recorded a valuation  allowance  as of
december  31  2002 and 2001  due to  uncertainties  related to its  ability to
utilize some of its deferred income tax assets  primarily consisting of certain
state net  operating  losses  carried  forward and  foreign tax credits  carried
forward  before  they  expire  the  valuation  allowance  is based on valeros
estimates of taxable  income in the various  jurisdictions  in which it operates
and the period over which  deferred  income tax assets will be  recoverable  if
actual  results  differ from the  estimates or valero  adjusts the  estimates in
future  periods  valero may need to revise  the  valuation  allowance  the net
deferred income tax assets as of december 31 2002 were 7838 million net of a
valuation allowance of 391 million

environmental liabilities
valeros  operations are subject to environmental  regulation by federal  state
and local  authorities  relating  primarily to  discharge of materials  into the
environment   waste  management  and  pollution  prevention  measures   future
legislative  action  and  regulatory  initiatives  could  result in  changes  to
required  operating  permits  additional  remedial actions or increased capital
expenditures  and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this
time  accruals for  environmental  liabilities  are based on best  estimates of
probable  undiscounted  future costs using  currently  available  technology and
applying  current  regulations  as well as valeros own internal  environmental
policies  valero believes that it has adequately  accrued for its environmental
exposures  however  environmental  liabilities  are  difficult  to assess  and
estimate   due  to   uncertainties   related  to  the   magnitude   of  possible
contamination  the timing  and  extent of  remediation  the  determination  of
valeros  liability in  proportion  to other  parties  improvements  in cleanup
technologies  and the extent to which  environmental  laws and  regulations may
change in the future

price risk management activities
valeros  financial  position and results of operations are affected by the type
of  derivative  instruments  and the  degree  of hedge  accounting  utilized  by
valeros  management to  accommodate  valeros risk  management  strategies  and
overall risk exposure levels

pension and other postretirement benefit obligations
valero has significant pension and postretirement  benefit liabilities and costs
that are developed from actuarial  valuations  inherent in these valuations are
key assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets future
compensation  increases  and  health  care cost  trend  rates  changes in these
assumptions are primarily  influenced by factors outside valeros  control  for
example the discount rate assumption is based on moodys published aa corporate
bond rate as of the end of each year  while the expected  return on plan assets
is based on a compounded return  calculated for valero by an outside  consultant
using  historical  market  index  data  from  1926  through  2001  with an asset
allocation  of 65  equities and 35 bonds  representative  of the asset mix in
valeros  pension plan these  assumptions can have a significant  effect on the
amounts reported in valeros consolidated  financial statements  for example a
025  decrease  in the  assumptions  related to the  discount  rate or expected
return on plan  assets or a 025  increase  in the  assumptions  related to the
health  care cost trend  rate or rate of  compensation  increase  would have the
following  effects on the projected  benefit  obligation as of december 31 2002
and net  periodic  benefit  cost  for the  year  ended  december  31  2003  in
millions

                                                                     other

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

commodity price risk

valero is exposed to market  risks  related to the  volatility  of crude oil and
refined product  prices  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used
in its  refining  operations  in  order to  reduce  the  risks  of these  price
fluctuations valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of
its refinery  feedstock  and refined  product  inventories  and a portion of its
unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges
valero also uses  derivative  commodity  instruments  to hedge the price risk of
forecasted  transactions such as forecasted  feedstock and natural gas purchases
and  refined  product  sales  cash  flow  hedges  in  addition  valero  uses
derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a
portion of its refined product  inventories and on certain forecasted  feedstock
and refined product  purchases that do not receive hedge  accounting  treatment
these derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in
their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales  finally  valero uses
derivative  commodity  instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental
and technical analysis of market conditions

the  types of  instruments  used in  valeros  hedging  and  trading  activities
described  above  include  swaps  futures and  options  valeros  positions in
derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a
risk control group to ensure  compliance  with valeros  stated risk  management
policy which has been  approved by valeros  board of  directors

the following tables provide  information  about valeros  derivative  commodity
instruments  as of december 31 2002 and 2001  dollars in millions  except for
the weightedaverage pay and receive prices as described below including
     o    fair value hedges held to hedge refining  inventories and unrecognized
          firm commitments
     o    cash  flow  hedges  held to  hedge  forecasted  feedstock  or  product
          purchases and refined product sales
     o    economic hedges held to
          o    manage price volatility in refined product inventories and
          o    manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock  natural gas and
               refined  product  purchases  and
     o    trading activities held or issued for trading purposes

contract  volumes  are  presented  in  thousands  of barrels  for crude oil and
refined products or in billions of british thermal units for natural gas the
weightedaverage  pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel for crude
oil and refined  products  or amounts per million  british  thermal  units for
natural gas volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes which are used
to calculate amounts due under the agreements the gain loss on swaps is equal
to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the
pay price times the notional contract volumes for futures and options the gain
loss  represents  i the excess of the fair value  amount  over the  contract
amount for long  positions  or ii the excess of the contract  amount over the
fair value amount for short  positions  additionally  for futures and options
the  weightedaverage pay price represents the contract price for long positions
and the  weightedaverage  receive price represents the contract price for short
positions the weightedaverage pay price and weightedaverage receive price for
options  represents  their strike price  all derivative  commodity  instruments
assumed in connection  with the uds  acquisition  were recorded at fair value on
december  31  2001  therefore  no gain  loss is shown as of that date in the
tables below  accordingly  swaps assumed in the uds acquisition have zero fair
value as of december 31 2001 as the  weightedaverage pay price is equal to the
weightedaverage receive price additionally for futures and options assumed in
the uds  acquisition  the  contract  amount  is equal to the fair  value of the
assumed contracts as of december 31 2001

approximately 4100 retail outlets in the united states and eastern canada under
various brand names including  diamond  shamrockr  shamrockr  ultramarr
valeror  beaconr  totalr and exxonr  valeros operations are affected
by
     o    companyspecific  factors  primarily  refinery  utilization rates and
          refinery maintenance turnarounds
     o    seasonal  factors  such as the demand for refined products during the
          summer driving season and heating oil during the winter season and
     o    industry  factors  such as  movements  in and the  level of crude oil

generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the consolidated  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes  actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates  on an ongoing  basis  management  reviews  its  estimates  based on
currently available  information  changes in facts and circumstances may result
in revised estimates

cash and temporary cash investments
valeros temporary cash investments are highly liquid lowrisk debt instruments
which have a maturity of three months or less when acquired  cash and temporary
cash  investments   exclude  cash  that  is  not  available  to  valero  due  to
restrictions related to its use such amounts are segregated in the consolidated
balance sheets in restricted cash

inventories
inventories  are  carried at the lower of cost or market  the cost of  refinery
feedstocks  purchased for processing and produced  products are determined under
the lastin  firstout lifo method  valero uses the dollarvalue lifo method
with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year the
cost of feedstocks and products  purchased for resale and the cost of materials
supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined  principally under the
weightedaverage cost method

liabilities  for  future  remediation  costs  are  recorded  when  environmental
assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated  other  than for  assessments  the  timing  and  magnitude  of these
accruals  are  generally  based on the  completion  of  investigations  or other
studies or a commitment  to a formal plan of action  environmental  liabilities
are  based  on best  estimates  of  probable  undiscounted  future  costs  using
currently  available  technology and applying  current  regulations  as well as
valeros own internal environmental policies the environmental liabilities have
not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties of amounts payable by
valero

price risk management activities
effective  january 1 2001  valero adopted  statement no 133  accounting for
derivative  instruments and hedging  activities as amended  statement no 133
established  accounting and reporting  standards for derivative  instruments and
for hedging activities  under statement no 133 all derivative instruments are
recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities  measured at their
fair value  changes in a derivatives  fair value are  recognized  currently in
income unless  specific  hedge  accounting  criteria are met  statement no 133
allows  special hedge  accounting  for  derivative  instruments  designated  and
qualifying  as a fair value  hedge or a cash flow  hedge  the gain or loss on a
derivative  instrument  designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge as well
as the  offsetting  loss or gain on the hedged item  attributable  to the hedged
risk  are  recognized  currently  in income in the same period  the  effective
portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying
as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component  of other  comprehensive  income
and is  reclassified  into income in the same period or periods during which the
hedged forecasted  transaction affects income the remaining ineffective portion
of the  gain  or loss  on the  derivative  instrument  if  any  is  recognized
currently  in income  the  adoption of this  statement  has not resulted in any
significant  changes in valeros business  practices  including its hedging and
trading  activities as described below  however  various system  modifications
have been required

when valero enters into a derivative instrument the derivative is designated as
a fair  value  hedge  a  cash  flow  hedge  an  economic  hedge  or a  trading
instrument  for those derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges
valero formally documents  at inception  the hedging relationship and its risk
management  objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the hedge as required by
statement no 133

valero accounts for its hedging relationships  designated and qualifying as fair
value  hedges  or cash  flow  hedges  in  accordance  with the  requirements  of
statement  no 133  for valeros  economic  hedging  relationships  hedges not
designated  as fair value or cash flow  hedges and for  derivative  instruments
entered  into by valero for  trading  purposes  the  derivative  instrument  is
recorded  at fair  value and the gain or loss on the  derivative  instrument  is
recognized currently in income

valero discontinues hedge accounting  prospectively if i it is determined that
the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value
or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk ii the derivative expires or is
sold terminated  or exercised or iii the derivative is no longer designated
as a hedging  instrument  in any of these  circumstances  valero may designate
prospectively a new hedging  relationship  with a new hedging  instrument or in
the case of i or iii a different hedged item or hedged transaction

when a cash flow hedge is  discontinued  valero continues to report the related
net derivative gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive  income until the
hedged forecasted  transaction  affects income at which time the net derivative

            notes to consolidated financial statements  continued


gain or loss is reclassified  into income  however  if it is probable that the
forecasted  transaction  will  not  occur  either  by the end of the  originally
specified time period or within two months thereafter  valero  reclassifies the
related derivative gain or loss from accumulated other comprehensive income into
income immediately

financial instruments
valeros  financial  instruments  include cash and temporary  cash  investments
restricted cash  receivables  payables  debt interest rate swaps  commodity
contracts  and foreign currency  contracts  the estimated fair values of these
financial  instruments  approximate  their  carrying  values as reflected in the
consolidated  balance sheets  except for certain longterm debt as discussed in
note 11  the fair  value of  valeros  debt  interest  rate  swaps  commodity
contracts and foreign currency  contracts was estimated based on yearend quoted
market prices

stockbased compensation
valero  accounts for its employee stock  compensation  plans using the intrinsic
value  method of  accounting  set forth in apb opinion no 25  accounting  for
stock  issued  to  employees  and  related  interpretations  as  permitted  by
statement  no 123  accounting  for  stockbased  compensation  accordingly
compensation  cost for stock  options is measured as the excess  if any of the
quoted  market price of valeros  common stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock

in december 2002 the fasb issued statement no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and  disclosure  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method
of accounting  for  stockbased  employee  compensation  statement no 148 also
amended the  disclosure  provisions to require  prominent  disclosure  about the
effects on reported net income of an entitys  accounting  policy decisions with
respect to  stockbased  employee  compensation  and amended apb opinion no 28
interim  financial  reporting  to require  disclosure  about those effects in
interim  financial  reports  statement  no  148 was  effective  for  financial
statements for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 since valero has not
changed to the fair value based method of accounting  for  stockbased  employee
compensation  there was no impact on valeros  financial position or results of
operations as a result of adopting this statement

the weightedaverage  fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
december 31 2002  2001 and 2000 was 955  1160 and 964 per stock option
respectively  the fair value of each stock  option  grant was  estimated on the
grant  date using the  blackscholes  optionpricing  model  with the  following
assumptions

                                                 year ended december 31

because  valero  accounts for its employee  stock  compensation  plans using the
intrinsic  value  method  no  compensation  cost  has  been  recognized  in the
statements  of income for  valeros  fixed  stock  option  plans as all  options

matters relates to the measurement of a preacquisition contingency related to a

548 million  barrels and 570 million barrels as of december 31 2002 and 2001

approximately 39 million there were no liquidations of lifo inventories during
the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000

in  determining  the carrying  value of valeros  inventories as of december 31
2001  valero  recognized  a net  reduction  in cost of  sales  of 88  million
resulting  from the effect of the valuation of  inventories  acquired in the uds
acquisition this reduction in cost of sales was attributable to
     o    a 1014  million  reduction in cost of sales due to the  valuation of
          the  2001  lifo  inventory  increment  resulting  primarily  from the
          december 31 2001 uds acquisition  under valeros pricing methodology

the  decrease  in accrued  employee  benefit  costs is due mainly to lower bonus
accruals  as of december  31  2002 as a result of the lower level of  operating
income recognized during 2002 the decrease in changeincontrol  benefits was a
result of  benefits  paid in early 2002 to uds  officers  and key  employees  in
connection  with the uds  acquisition  included in other  accrued  expenses are
amounts primarily related to various accruals for refining retail and corporate
expenses

17 price risk management activities

valero is exposed to market  risks  related to the  volatility  of crude oil and
refined product  prices  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used
in its  refining  operations  to reduce the  impact of this  price  volatility
valero uses derivative  commodity  instruments  swaps  futures and options to
manage its exposure to
     o    changes in the fair value of a portion of its refinery  feedstock  and
          refined  product  inventories and a portion of its  unrecognized  firm
          commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges
     o    changes  in cash  flows of  certain  forecasted  transactions  such as
          forecasted  feedstock  purchases  natural gas  purchases  and refined
          product sales cash flow hedges and
     o    price  volatility on a portion of its refined product  inventories and

          not  designated  as either  fair value or cash flow  hedges  economic
          hedges

foreign currency risk
valero is exposed to exchange rate  fluctuations on transactions  related to its
canadian operations to manage its exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations
valero uses foreign currency  exchange and purchase  contracts  these contracts
are not designated as hedging instruments

during may 2002  valero  entered into foreign  currency  exchange  contracts to
hedge its  exposure  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on an  investment  in its
canadian operations under these contracts valero sold 400 million of canadian
dollars  and bought  2534  million of us  dollars  these  contracts  mature
annually at various  amounts  from 2003 through  2007  as of december 31 2002
these contracts had a fair value of 61 million  which are included in prepaid
expenses and other current  assets and deferred  charges and other  assets  the
gain  recognized  in income on these  contracts  which was 61 million for the
year ended december 31 2002 was substantially offset by a loss of 24 million
recognized  in income from the effect of the exchange  rate  fluctuation  on the
hedged investment for the year

exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions was
two years with the majority of the transactions maturing in less than one year
for the  years  ended  december  31  2002  and  2001  there  were  no  amounts
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into income as a
result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting

market and credit risk
valeros  price risk  management  activities  involve  the receipt or payment of
fixed price commitments into the future  these transactions give rise to market
risk the risk that future  changes in market  conditions may make an instrument
less valuable  valero closely  monitors and manages its exposure to market risk
on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by its board of directors
market risks are  monitored by a risk control  group to ensure  compliance  with
valeros  stated risk  management  policy  concentrations  of  customers in the
refining  industry may impact valeros  overall exposure to credit risk in that
these  customers  may be  similarly  affected  by changes in  economic  or other
conditions  valero  believes  that its  counterparties  will be able to satisfy
their obligations under their price risk management contracts with valero

approximately  17  million of the amt  credit  1 million of the us  federal
income tax credits  and 20 million of the us federal nol  carryforwards  are
subject to annual us federal income tax limitations

valero has recorded a valuation  allowance as of december 31 2002 and 2001 due
to  uncertainties  related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income
tax assets  primarily  consisting of certain state net operating  losses carred
forward and  foreign  tax credits  carried  forward  before  they  expire  the
valuation  allowance  is based on valeros  estimates  of taxable  income in the
various  jurisdictions  in which it operates and the period over which  deferred
income tax assets will be  recoverable  the  realization of net deferred income
tax assets  recorded as of december 31 2002 is dependent upon valeros  ability
to  generate  future  taxable  income  in both the  us  and  canada  although
realization is not assured  valero believes it is more likely than not that the
net deferred income tax assets will be realized

us federal deferred income taxes or canadian  withholding  taxes have not been
provided for on the  undistributed  earnings of valeros  canadian  subsidiaries
based on the determination that those earnings will be indefinitely  reinvested
as of  december  31  2002  the  cumulative  undistributed  earnings  of  these
subsidiaries  were  approximately  80  million  if  those  earnings  were  not
considered  indefinitely  reinvested  us  federal  deferred  income taxes and
canadian  withholding  taxes would have been  recorded  after  consideration  of
foreign tax credits

valeros  separate tax years  through 1998 and udss tax years  through 1994 and
for 1998 are  closed  to  adjustment  by the  internal  revenue  service  udss
separate tax years 1995 through 1997 are  currently  under  examination  valero
believes that adequate  provisions  for income taxes have been  reflected in the
consolidated financial statements

studies or a commitment  to a formal plan of action  environmental  liabilities
are  based  on best  estimates  of  probable  undiscounted  future  costs  using
currently  available  technology and applying  current  regulations  as well as

in  connection   with  its  various   acquisitions   valero   assumed   several
environmental  liabilities  including  but not limited to certain  remediation
obligations site restoration costs and certain liabilities relating to soil and
groundwater contamination

in 2000 the us environmental  protection agency epa issued to a majority of
refiners  operating  in the  united  states a  series  of  information  requests
pursuant  to  section  114 of  the  clean  air  act as  part  of an  enforcement
initiative  valero received a section 114 information request pertaining to all
of its refineries  owned at that time  valero has completed its response to the
request  several other refiners have reached settlements with the epa regarding
this enforcement initiative though valero has not been named in any proceeding

            notes to consolidated financial statements  continued


it also has been discussing the possibility of settlement with the epa regarding
this initiative  based in part upon announced settlements and evaluation of its
relative  position  valero expects to incur  penalties and related  expenses in
connection with a potential  settlement of this enforcement  initiative  valero
believes  that any  potential  settlement  penalties  will be  immaterial to its
financial position  however valero believes that any potential settlement with
the epa in this matter will require various  capital  improvements or changes in
operating  parameters  or both at some or all of its refineries which could be
material in the aggregate

valero believes that it has adequately provided for its environmental  exposures
with the accruals referred to above  these liabilities have not been reduced by
potential future  recoveries from third parties  environmental  liabilities are
difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors such as the magnitude of
possible contamination  the timing and extent of remediation the determination
of valeros  liability in proportion to other parties  improvements  in cleanup
technologies  and the extent to which  environmental  laws and  regulations may
change in the future

24 litigation matters

unocal
in 2002  union oil company of california  unocal sued valero  alleging patent
infringement  the  complaint  seeks  a 575  cent  per  gallon  royalty  on all
reformulated  gasoline  infringing  on  unocals  393 and 126  patents  these
patents cover certain  compositions of cleanerburning  gasoline  the complaint
seeks  treble  damages for valeros  alleged  willful  infringement  of unocals
patents and valeros  alleged  conduct to induce others to infringe the patents
in a previous lawsuit  involving its 393 patent  unocal prevailed against five
other major refiners  in 2001 the federal trade  commission began an antitrust
investigation  concerning  unocals conduct with a joint industry research group
during the time that unocal was  prosecuting  its patents at the us patent and
trademark office pto on march 4 2003 the ftc announced that it was filing a
complaint against unocal for antitrust violations  the ftcs complaint seeks an
injunction against any future patent enforcement activity by unocal each of the
393 and 126 patents is being reexamined by the pto the pto has issued notices
of  rejection  of all  claims of each of these  patents  these  rejections  are
subject to additional  proceedings  including  administrative appeal by unocal
followed  by an  appeal  in  federal  district  court or the  court of  appeals
ultimate  invalidation  would preclude  unocal from pursuing claims based on the
393 or 126 patents  unocals  patent lawsuit  against valero is  indefinitely
stayed as a result of the pto  reexamination  proceedings  notwithstanding  the
judgment against the other refiners in the previous litigation  valero believes
that it has several strong defenses to unocals lawsuit including those arising
from unocals  misconduct  and valero  believes it will prevail in the lawsuit
however  due  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  litigation  there  can be no
assurance that valero will prevail  and an adverse result could have a material
adverse effect on valeros results of operations and financial position

mtbe litigation
valero  is  a  defendant  in  various  cases  alleging  mtbe   contamination  in
groundwater in new york and  california  the plaintiffs  generally  allege that
refiners  and   manufacturers  of  gasoline   containing  mtbe  are  liable  for
manufacturing a defective product  in california  the lawsuits have been filed
by local water providers including the city of santa monica the city of dinuba
and fruitridge vista water company in new york a lawsuit has been filed by the
suffolk  county water  authority  these cases are primarily  based on a product
liabilityproduct defect theory and seek individual  unquantified  compensatory
and punitive  damages and attorneys  fees  valero believes it is unlikely that

            notes to consolidated financial statements  continued


the final outcome of any one of these suits filed by local water providers would
have a  material  adverse  effect on its  results  of  operations  or  financial
position  but that an adverse  result in a majority of these cases could have a
material  adverse  effect  on  valeros  results  of  operations  and  financial
position

valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary  course of  business  valero  believes it is  unlikely  that the final
outcome of any of the claims or  proceedings to which it is a party would have a
material  adverse  effect on its  financial  position  results of operations or
liquidity  however due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation the range of
possible loss if any cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision
and there can be no assurance  that the  resolution of any  particular  claim or
proceeding  would not have an adverse effect on valeros  results of operations
financial position or liquidity
