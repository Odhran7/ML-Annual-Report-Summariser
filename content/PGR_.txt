description of business 

organization 

our executive group oversees the business and corporate groups that support all areas of our organization and consists of the following 



our insurance and claims organizations are generally managed on a statebystate basis due to the nature of insurance legal and regulatory requirements and other local factors and are supplemented by national operations and supported by our corporate functions statespecific organizations typically report to a regional general manager who then reports to the applicable group president in california we operate a separate agency auto organization with its own management 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles which we refer to as our special lines products this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group as of december 31 2021 we wrote our personal lines products in all states however our special lines products are not written in the district of columbia the personal lines business accounted for 78 of our total net premiums written in 2021 82 in 2020 and 83 in 2019 

the personal lines segment consists of personal auto and special lines products 

• personal auto insurance represented approximately 94 of our total personal lines net premiums written in 2021 2020 and 2019 we ranked third in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2020 based on premiums written and we believe we continued to hold that position for 2021 there are approximately 280 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 25 billion of premiums annually comprise about 83 of this market all industry data including ranking and market share based on premiums written has been obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc am best or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

• special lines products which include insurance for motorcycles atvs rvs watercraft snowmobiles and similar items represented the remaining personal lines net premiums written for the years mentioned above due to the seasonal nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 and that we are one of the largest providers of rv and boat insurance 

 1  

our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

• the agency business includes business written by our network of more tha n 40000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states including brokerages in new york and california t hese independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with our mandated procedures the agents and brokers do not have authority to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other transactions or commitments the agency business also writes insurance through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions and national agencies the total net premiums written through the agency channel represented 48 of our personal lines volume in both 2021 and 2020 and 49 in 2019 

• the direct business includes business written directly by us on the internet through mobile devices and over the phone the total net premiums written by the direct business represented 52 of our personal lines volume in both 2021 and 2020 and 51 in 2019 

our personal lines strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a broad range of personal auto and special lines insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers and combined with property insurance and other products when appropriate to match our customers’ needs volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition quality service and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” below for further discussion 

we seek to refine our personal auto segmentation underwriting models and pricing over time and we regularly elevate new product models at any one time we could have multiple product models in the marketplace as new versions are being rolled out from state to state such new product models generally introduce new risk variables intended to improve the accuracy of matching rate to risk increase our competitiveness or make our products more attractive to specific market segments among other enhancements 

we continue to provide customers in both the agency and direct channels the opportunity to improve their auto insurance rates 

based on their personal driving behavior through snapshot ®  our usagebased insurance ubi program we offer snapshot through both our hardwarebased and mobileapp versions in nearly all states this mobile app is intended to improve the user experience while also reducing our monitoring costs in addition to the personal benefits for our customers the data collected via the mobile app affords us a unique perspective on mobile device usage vehicle operations and accidents our updated auto product models discussed above often also include snapshot enhancements to improve its competitiveness and broaden its applicability 

our personal lines business is focused on efforts to form deeper and longerterm relationships with our customers through our destination era strategy through this strategy we seek to leverage progressive home our property business as well as insurance and noninsurance products offered by unaffiliated third parties to provide our customers access to a range of products addressing their diverse needs and if the customer chooses to “bundle” certain of the products together bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda customers who prefer to bundle represent a sizable segment of the insurance market and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs our destination era strategy involves a number of initiatives including 

• in our agency channel we offer customers the opportunity to bundle our auto and progressive home offerings to further drive bundling in the agency channel we offer the platinum program to those select agents who have the appropriate customers for our bundled offering this program combines our auto and home insurance with compensation coordinated policy periods single event deductible and other features that meet the needs and desires that our agents have expressed as of december 31 2021 we had just over 4100 platinum agents 

• we offer independent agents an agency quoting system that makes it easier for them to bundle multiple policies with us our “portfolio” quoting system reduces data entry displays all available products eligible for bundled quotes simplifies the agents’ experience on third party comparative rater systems and provides agents and their customers an overview of premium bundle savings and applied discounts to allow them to add or remove products with one click portfolio is available for all agents appointed to write new business where we offer progressive home products 

• in the direct channel we bundle progressive auto with progressive home products in almost all states as well as with homeowners and renters products provided by unaffiliated insurance carriers nationwide we offer these bundles by providing a single destination to which consumers may come for both their auto and property insurance needs in many cases we may offer discounts to incentivize or reward this bundling

• as we increase our penetration of the more complex multiproduct customers who are critical to our destination era success we are further expanding the roster of products provided by unaffiliated companies that we make available through online and telephonic referrals and for which we receive commissions or other compensation that are reported as service revenues our list of unaffiliated company products includes home security home warranty personal loans and health life pet and travel insurance 

commercial lines 

the commercial lines segment writes autorelated liability and physical damage insurance workers’ compensation insurance primarily for the transportation industry and businessrelated general liability and property insurance predominately for small businesses in june 2021 we acquired protective insurance corporation and subsidiaries protective insurance to expand our portfolio of offerings to larger fleet workers’ compensation coverage for trucking and public transportation fleets along with trucking industry independent contractors and affinity programs protective insurance represented 1 of companywide net premiums written and 6 of commercial lines net premiums written from the date of acquisition see note 17 – acquisition to our financial statements included in our 2021 annual report to shareholders which is filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the annual report for further discussion the commercial lines business accounted for 17 of our total net premiums written in 2021 and 13 in both 2020 and 2019 

the following discussion excludes transportation network company tnc business unless otherwise noted 

we offer our auto products in all states our commercial lines auto customers insure approximately two vehicles per policy during 2021 we wrote about 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel 

there are approximately 340 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 50 other large companiesgroups each with over 200 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 82 of this market our commercial lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2020 based on premiums written and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2021 

the commercial lines business operates in the following commercial auto business market targets 

• business auto – autos vans pickup trucks used by small businesses such as retailing farming services and private trucking and forhire livery nonfleet ie five or fewer vehicles taxis blackcar services and airport taxis 

• forhire transportation – tractors trailers and straight trucks primarily used by regional general freight and expeditortype businesses and longhaul operators 

• contractor – vans pickup trucks and dump trucks used by small businesses such as artisans heavy construction and landscaperssnowplowers 

• forhire specialty – dump trucks log trucks and garbage trucks used by dirt sand and gravel logging and coaltype businesses and 

• tow – tow trucks and wreckers used in towing services and gasservice station businesses 

as with our personal auto products we regularly introduce new commercial auto product models designed to improve our pricing accuracy and competitiveness through improved segmentation the use of additional risk variables and other enhancements new models are typically rolled out on a statebystate basis and as a result we often have more than one product version in the marketplace at a time 

similar to snapshot in the personal auto business the commercial lines business offers its customers ubi options smart haul ® is the ubi program that uses driving data from a motor carrier’s existing electronic logging device smart haul offers owner operators and small fleets the ability to receive discounts on their insurance by sharing their electronic logging device generated data with us snapshot proview ®  which was launched in 2020 is the ubi program for commercial auto customers without their own electronic logging device snapshot proview allows customers to earn upfront discounts and provides valueadded services like fleet management and personalized tips to encourage safe driving both programs are available in almost all states 

in addition we provide commercial auto coverage in the tnc business to uber technologies subsidiaries in 13 states and to lyft’s rideshare operations in 7 states and in the district of columbia tnc represented about 6 of our commercial lines net premiums written for 2021 and 4 for 2020 premiums written in our tnc business are determined in part by estimating the number of miles to be driven over the life of the policy term on a policybypolicy basis these premium estimates are adjusted 

 3  

monthly based both on actual miles driven and an estimate of miles to be driven during the remaining policy term during 2021 our tnc business experienced a strong increase in rideshare miles traveled compared to 2020 when covid19 restrictions were in place see item 1a risk factors – ii insurance risks – iii operating risks and – vii other below for more information 

we also offer businessrelated general liability and property insurance through our business owners policy bop insurance these products are geared specifically to small businesses and are currently available to agents in a majority of states excluding the district of columbia with plans to expand to additional states during 2022 we also continue to act as an agent for business customers to place bop general liability professional liability and workers’ compensation coverage through unaffiliated insurance carriers and are compensated through commissions which are reported as service revenues to further help our direct customers we offer businessquote explorer ® bqx a digital application that allows small business owners to obtain quotes for our bop product and the products offered from a select group of unaffiliated carriers 

property 

our property segment writes residential property and renters insurance in virtually all states primarily in the independent agency channel and through select agents under our platinum program discussed above we also act as a participant in the “write your own” program for the national flood insurance program under which we write flood insurance in virtually all states 100 of this business is reinsured 

our property business accounted for 5 of our total net premiums written in both 2021 and 2020 and 4 in 2019 we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters of the year based on the cyclical nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent as a property insurer we have exposure to losses from catastrophes including hurricanes and other severe storms see item 1a risk factors – ii insurance risks and – iii operating risks below for more information to help mitigate these risks we enter into reinsurance arrangements see the “reinsurance” section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs 

as one of the 15 largest homeowners carriers in the united states we specialize in residential property insurance for homeowners other property owners and renters as well as insurance for manufactured homes personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 385 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide and we compete with many of these companies we primarily compete with about 20 other large companiesgroups each with over 800 million of premiums written annually which comprise about 72 of the market 

as discussed above our property business is an important component of our destination era strategy 

reinsurance 

our reinsurance activity includes both transactions which are regulated and those that are nonregulated eg voluntary the regulated programs include several mandatory state pools such as the michigan catastrophic claims association florida hurricane catastrophe fund and north carolina reinsurance facility as well as other reinsurance facilities required by specific states for various lines of business we are also a participant in the “write your own” program for federally regulated plans for flood national flood insurance program and act as servicing agent for statemandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles caip plans our current caip service contract will expire in 2022 and we currently do not intend to renew it all of these programs are governed by insurance regulations 

our nonregulated arrangements reinsure activities in our property business and our commercial lines business 

property programs 

the reinsurance program in our property business is designed to reduce overall risk while to the extent of coverage purchased protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophic events the property program includes contracts that cover multiyear periods we also maintain an excess of loss reinsurance treaty covering our personal umbrella business 

the occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital and is comprised of privately placed reinsurance reinsurance placed through catastrophe bond transactions and coverage obtained through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund under the occurrence excess of loss reinsurance we are responsible for the first 200 million of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae from each event we may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum coverage limits of the reinsurance that is then in place the coverage limits currently in place are 

• 214 billion for a first event in florida 

• 170 billion for a first event outside of florida and 

coverage for a second event and potentially for subsequent covered events would depend on several factors including the location and the extent of covered losses of the earlier events in the contract period portions of our program include reinstatement limits providing coverage for subsequent events some portions of our occurrence program have an obligatory 

 4  

reinstatement of coverage during 2021 we ceded 200 million of losses and alae under the occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program all related to hurricane ida 

in addition during the 2021 hurricane season we added coverage in our reinsurance program that provided 100 million of coverage for named storms hurricanes and tropical storms that were identified by name according to property claims service pcs this reinsurance arrangement can depending on the circumstances provide additional coverage for a significant covered event or provide coverage for aggregate pcs losses under our occurrence retention during 2021 we ceded no losses under this “hurricane season” coverage we have renewed this coverage for the 2022 hurricane season 

during 2021 our property business also had an aggregate excess of loss program structure which provided a maximum amount of 225 million of coverage for nonnamed storms and in certain cases for named storms in multiple layers with varying retention thresholds starting at 475 million in the aggregate 

each layer in the aggregate excess of loss program was subject to a per occurrence 2 million deductible before each loss could be considered for aggregate retention and each event was subject to a 98 million coverage limit during 2021 no losses were ceded under this aggregate excess of loss agreement related to 2021 accident year storms 

in january 2022 the property business entered into a new aggregate excess of loss program for the 2022 accident year with the following two layers 

• the first layer has a retention threshold of 575 million and provides 75 million of coverage for pcs designated catastrophe event losses and alae except those from named storms 

• the second layer has a retention threshold of 650 million and provides 100 million of coverage for pcs designated catastrophe event losses and alae including coverage for named storms 

similar to the 2021 aggregated excess of loss program each layer is subject to a per occurrence 2 million deductible before each loss could be considered for aggregate retention and each event is subject to a 98 million coverage cap the first layer does not have to be exhausted before the second layer can be applied 

commercial lines programs 

the reinsurance program in our commercial lines business is designed to help manage certain exposures in our commercial auto tnc bop and workers’ compensation products our commercial lines business uses quotashare reinsurance agreements for tnc and certain workers’ compensation and bop coverages under each agreement we cede a portion of premiums losses and in most cases loss adjustment expenses lae 

as part of the commercial lines program we also have excess of loss reinsurance agreements for higherlimit commercial auto liability and certain bop and workers’ compensation coverages which reinsures a portion of loss above a retention threshold the retention threshold for the bop and progressive highlimits auto liability excess of loss agreements is 1 million for each casualty occurrence or each property loss for the protective insurance excess commercial auto business we retain the first 2 million per occurrence and have coverage excess of 2 million up to 5 million under the current program in certain scenarios our retention could be reduced to 1 million depending on the accumulation of losses in excess of 1 million in addition for the workers’ compensation product we have catastrophe workers’ compensation coverage up to 100 million pursuant to a 20 million maximum any one life sublimit in general we retain approximately 15 million per occurrence on workers compensation through the use of excess of loss and quotashare reinsurance 

for our tnc product the amounts ceded vary by state a portion of the quotashare reinsurance contract is written through reinsurers that are owned by the tnc companies reinsurance recoverables under this arrangement are required by our contracts to be collateralized ie secured by assets held by an independent third party or a letter of credit issued by a commercial bank at a target of over 100 of the recoverable balance the remaining portion of reinsurance for the tnc product is written by a panel of thirdparty reinsurers 

program evaluation 

we evaluate our reinsurance programs during our renewal discussions if not more frequently to ensure they continue to effectively respond to the company’s risk tolerance for example when we were looking to renew our occurrence excess of loss contract during the second quarter 2021 we learned the rates being charged by reinsurers for such contracts were increasing however we did not encounter a lack of availability for this coverage in conjunction with our capital position and growing balance sheet we determined that we were able to increase our retention threshold to 200 million from the prior year 80 million retention as a result of this decision the premium costs to us for the renewed annual contract term were about 15 million less than we paid for the prior year we will continue to balance the company’s ability to assume more risk with the availability and costs of various types of reinsurance contracts see item 1a risk factors – ii insurance risks and – vi credit and other financial risks below and note 7 – reinsurance in our annual report for more information 

 5  

claims 

our employees handle nearly all of our personal and commercial lines claims from either physical claims offices throughout the united states or through a virtual environment and are supported by centralized functions at our corporate offices and a nationwide network of nearly 2450 thirdparty repair shops during 2021 we began using independent claims adjusters opportunistically in our vehicle businesses to help support our claim employees manage claims inventory and to timely respond to our customers impacted by hurricane ida we do not intend to use independent adjusters as an ongoing material part of our claims handling model 

for our property business we manage a majority of our claims through a network of independent claims field adjusters with internal claims representatives managing the overall claims process as of december 31 2021 we employed about 530 internal property claim representatives and about 190 staff field adjusters we plan to continue to increase our internal claims staff in 2022 

competitive factors 

the insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology to operate our business and on extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies highquality customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is also affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we sustain security breaches or other “cyber attacks” on our systems or are unable to maintain uninterrupted access to our systems business functions and the systems of certain thirdparty providers see item 1a risk factors – ii insurance risks – iii operating risks – v liquidity risk and – vii other below for more information 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry several of our competitors have many more patents than we do some of the patents we currently hold include a usagebased insurance patent expiring in 2024 or after two us patents on the name your price ® functionality on our website expiring in 2028 or after three multiproduct quoting patents expiring in 2032 or after three patents for our implementation of a mobile insurance platform and architecture expiring in 2032 or after a patent on our system of providing customized insurance quotes based on a user’s price andor coverage preferences expiring in 2033 or after two patents for our loyalty call routing system expiring in 2033 or after a patent for a multivariate predictive system that processes usagebased data expiring in 2035 or after three patents for the implementation of chatbots in online quoting and servicing expiring in 2038 or after a patent for our commercial lines business classification system expiring in 2039 or after and two patents for our automated document classification system expiring 2040 or after 

we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from nearly 43 billion driving miles derived from our usagebased devices and our mobile app we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market 

insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various insurance regulatory authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing jurisdiction such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

 6  

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states the district of columbia bermuda canada and puerto rico the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its jurisdiction of domicile our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of delaware florida illinois indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws we also have subsidiaries that write excess and surplus lines these activities do not require a license but are regulated 

insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

• licensing of insurers and agents 

• capital and surplus requirements 

• statutory accounting principles specific to insurance companies and the content of required financial and other reports 

• requirements for establishing insurance reserves 

• investments 

• acquisitions of insurers and transactions between insurers and their affiliates 

• limitations on rates of return or profitability 

• rating criteria rate levels and rate changes 

• insolvencies of insurance companies 

• assigned risk programs 

• authority to exit a business and 

• numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations including required coverages policy forms underwriting standards and claims handling 

insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with insurance laws and regulations in addition in some jurisdictions the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance which is the target for our vehicle businesses our property business maintains a lower premiumstosurplus ratio thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2021 we had net premiums written of 464 billion and statutory surplus of 164 billion the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 28 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2021 we had access to 42 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes 

the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is determined by a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2021 our rbc ratios were in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

• the insurer’s financial statements under statutory accounting principles 

• details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer 

• specific investments held by the insurer and 

• numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations 

 7  

insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see note 8 – statutory financial information in our annual report for further discussion 

under insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to applicable guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many jurisdictions as a condition of doing business in the jurisdiction to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many jurisdictions also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those jurisdictions 

many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain jurisdictions limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain jurisdictions also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the jurisdiction except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the jurisdiction’s insurance department the insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses in the second quarter of 2022 we will start nonrenewing about 60000 homeowners policies in florida and expect that it will take about one year to complete the process 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of unfairdiscriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information cybersecurity use of credit and other information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development use of artificial intelligence and algorithms rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the federal insurance office is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

investments

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

• commercial automobile insurance proceduresplans caip – we are the only servicing carrier on a nationwide basis for caip plans which are statesupervised plans servicing the involuntary market in nearly all states as a service provider we provide policy issuance and claims adjusting services and collect fee revenue reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations subject to contractual service standards our current caip service contract administered through the automobile insurance plan services office will expire in 2022 we do not intend to renew this contract any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

• commissionbased businesses – we act as an agent for other insurance companies we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by unaffiliated insurance companies in the continental united states in the direct channel we also offer our customers the ability to package their commercial auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies we receive commissions for the policies written under this program which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae which include alae eg defense and cost containment expenses and unallocated lae eg adjusting and other expenses of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or ibnr are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors 

these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary

we employ expansive recruiting practices with a goal towards having qualified and deep candidate pools and are attracting candidates from both established and new sources we believe that our recruitment efforts generally have enabled us to present diverse and highpotential pools of job candidates to our hiring managers in turn we train our hiring managers about unconscious biases they may have during the interview and selection process and the importance of employing individuals with 

 9  

different kinds of experiences and educational backgrounds we believe these strategies collectively enhance our applicant pools and contribute to our continued success 

engage and retain 

we understand that engaged employees are more productive provide better service to our customers and are more likely to stay with progressive each year we survey our people to measure their engagement our 2021 engagement and culture survey results placed us in the top decile of all companies using the survey which is designed by a nationallyknown third party and administered in like form to over 1000 employers in the united states we use the results along with other information to evaluate our human capital strategies and the health of our culture 

employee retention is an important part of our strategy our annualized employee retention rate for 2021 was 84 and as of december 31 2021 more than 15000 employees had over 10 years of tenure at the company promoting from within is also a key part of our strategy many of our leaders including current executive team members joined progressive in a more junior position and advanced to significant leadership positions within the organization in 2021 we filled approximately 72 of our open positions above entry level by promoting from within including just over 2000 managerial positions 

demographic data 

we publish employee and manager demographic information on our website and update this data on an annual basis we also disclose our consolidated eeo1 data online 

• as of december 31 2021 we had about 49000 employees of which 57 were women and 37 were people of color while women comprised 52 and people of color comprised 38 of the us workforce

 item 1a risk factors 

i summary 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives our risk categories include 

• insurance risks  risks associated with assuming or indemnifying for the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders 

• operating risks  risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations 

• market risks  risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios 

• liquidity risk  risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability to meet our shortterm cash collateral or other financial obligations and 

• credit and other financial risks  risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary 

we have also included an “other” section in the discussion below 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold technological advances home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our equity or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time

ii insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents other insured events and associated losses and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events loss costs expenses and inflation among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

• the availability of sufficient reliable data 

• our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data 

• uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions generally 

• our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy 

• our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy 

• our ability to reflect changes in reinsurance costs in a timely manner 

• the development selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies 

• our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies 

• our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis 

• our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately 

• unanticipated court decisions legislation or regulatory actions 

• the frequency severity duration and geographic location and scope of catastrophe events which may be becoming more severe and less predictable as a result of climate change 

• our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices 

• changing vehicle usage and driving patterns which may be influenced by pandemics or changes in oil and gas prices among other factors changes in residential occupancy patterns and the emerging sharing economy 

• advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles 

• unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations 

• unforeseen disruptive technologies and events 

• the ability to understand the risk profile of significant customers such as transportation network companies and 

• unanticipated changes in auto repair costs auto parts prices used car prices or construction requirements or labor and materials costs or the imposition and impacts of tariffs 

we are seeing new insurance regulations various legislative and regulatory challenges political initiatives and other societal pressures that seek to limit or prohibit the use of specific rating factors in insurance policy pricing such as credit education and occupation in our view these efforts have the potential to significantly undermine the effectiveness of riskbased pricing if we are unable to use rating factors that have been shown empirically to be highly predictive of risk we may not be able to as accurately match insurance rates to the applicable risks which may significantly adversely impact our insurance operating results 

the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 13  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

• the availability of sufficient reliable data 

• the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends including the effects of future inflation rates for multiple products in multiple markets 

• unexpected changes in medical costs auto repair costs or the costs of construction labor and materials and the imposition and impacts of tariffs 

• unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations 

• new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coveragerelated issues by courts 

• the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices 

• our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims 

• the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements 

• the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves and 

• the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims 

the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

our insurance operating results have been and will likely continue to be materially adversely affected by severe weather or other catastrophe events and climate change may be exacerbating these impacts 

our insurance operating results have periodically been and in the future will likely continue to be materially adversely affected by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks cyber attacks epidemics pandemics riots and hazardous material releases the frequency severity duration and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover climate change may be contributing to the increase in frequency of severe weather events and other natural disasters how long they last and how much insured damage they cause and may change where the events occur catastrophe losses have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses in addition our property business has a concentration of policies in force in states with significant exposure to hurricanes and hailstorms and its results may be impacted by catastrophe events in these states to a greater relative degree than other insurers 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe event is a function of our total insured exposure in the area affected by the event the nature severity and duration of the event and the extent of reinsurance that we have obtained with respect to such an event we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable due to climate change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency severity or duration or unanticipated changes in geographic location or scope of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines businesses including our workers’ compensation and business owners policies and the transportation network company business and our umbrella insurance business reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we remain 

 14  

liable under our policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute our reinsurance claims and this risk may be heightened to the extent climate change causes higher than anticipated losses for a reinsurer across its businesses further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions which have been and in the future could be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events such as weatherrelated catastrophes in such events we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the unavailability andor increased cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition 

iii operating risks 

we compete in property and casualty insurance markets that are highly competitive 

the markets in which we sell insurance are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other companies potentially including existing insurance companies vehicle manufacturing companies other wellfinanced companies seeking new opportunities or new competitors with technological or other innovations also have entered these markets and may continue to do so in the future many of our competitors have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills innovation operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time such as advances in vehicle technology autonomous or semiautonomous vehicles or vehiclesharing arrangements we may also be adversely affected in our commercial lines business which represents a significant portion of our growth potential by trends or events that decrease the demand for services offered by or decrease the profitability of the commercial auto market including trucking businesses and ridesharing services 

we expect similar and perhaps greater competitive pressures with respect to any new insurance or noninsurance businesses that we decide to enter in the future in such cases we would be selling products or services that are new to us while our competitors could include large wellfinanced companies with significant product and marketing experience in such businesses 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different products and for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again the ability to discern at any point in time whether we are in a “hard” or “soft” market is often difficult as such a conclusion represents an assessment of innumerable data points including among others the operating results of and the dynamic competitive actions taken by us and many competitors in multiple markets involving a variety of products often detailed information on our competitors becomes available on a delayed basis and the nature of the market becomes apparent only in retrospect our ability to predict future competitive conditions is also constrained as a result 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of insurance business in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

 15  

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services which may include technological advances that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed and agility the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver highquality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our businesses and the speed of some of these developments may be increasing risks associated with these developments include 

• our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems including “cloud computing” environments and software as a service applications 

• the development of new modes of communication 

• changing insurance shopping trends 

• our understanding of the operations and needs of significant customers 

• challenges in using machine learning and artificial intelligence in our business processes in a responsible and compliant manner and 

• the availability and uses of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets including the availability of sufficient internal and external talent that understand and can manage the complexity and related risks 

complexity may among other potential difficulties create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences with the speed and agility that may be required require us to modify our business practices adopt new systems or upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies 

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights from time to time has resulted in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

we have made significant investments in our brand over many years and we believe it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to maintain and improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that maintaining and improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns 

 16  

relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by situations that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices adverse financial developments perceptions of our corporate governance or how we address employee matters and concerns or environmental or social responsibility initiatives investments in our portfolio the conduct of our officers directors or employees the actions of a significant customer or other businesses with which we do business or in which we invest including unaffiliated insurers and other companies whose products we offer or make available to our customers or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as consumers and other stakeholders increase or change their expectations regarding the conduct of large public companies sustainability efforts and corporate responsibility these impacts may be further complicated such that perceptions are formed through rapid and broad interactions using modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control any such event could decrease demand for our products reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees and lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our businesses 

our ability to attract develop and retain talent including employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our insurance businesses and investment operations and assess potential expansion into new products and business areas our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or retain talented executives managers and employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks may be heightened when united states labor markets or key segments of those markets are especially competitive 

our workplace policies or perceptions of those policies by current and potential employees including policies with respect to remote and hybrid work or protocols for in person work could impact our ability to attract and retain talent with needed skills and experiences this risk may be heightened during periods in which a pandemic or other widespread health risk exists 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and we must adapt to increases in business due to additions of or expansions with significant customers such as transportation network companies in any such case we must adjust our hiring and training programs and staffing levels appropriately our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

we use thirdparty labor to meet a portion of our staffing needs any significant loss in access to qualified external talent on a costeffective basis could have an adverse effect on our business competitive labor markets can cause increased costs for thirdparty labor and those increases may be material 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees or our culture including any impact arising from an increase in remote workers relative to historic levels in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states puerto rico the district of columbia canada its provinces and bermuda each jurisdiction has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain united states federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information methods of customer communications employment practices and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

 17  

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations that apply to us and judicial interpretations of those laws the pace of change together with shorter time frames between enactment or promulgation and effectiveness of the changes increases this risk insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things an insurer’s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable businesses prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs for us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including potentially material assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

in addition data privacy and security regulations impose complex compliance and reporting requirements and challenges for example the california consumer privacy act which was passed by a consumer initiative in 2018 was amended in 2020 to afford california residents additional rights compliance with this new legislation will be challenging and is expected to require further modifications to our business systems and operations with a january 1 2023 effective date which is a relatively short time frame to build compliance efforts and without the benefit of related regulations which have not yet been released other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering privacy and security legislation or regulations each jurisdiction’s unique requirements and the variations across the jurisdictions present further ongoing compliance challenges compliance with these laws and regulations will result in increased costs which may be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in certain jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace or our brand and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class actions collective actions representative actions and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of among other things our subsidiaries’ methods used for evaluating and paying medical or injury claims or benefits including certain bodily injury personal injury protection uninsured motoristunderinsured motorist umuim and medical payment claims and for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicaremedicaid beneficiaries other claims handling practices and procedures including challenges relating to our network of repair facilities our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles our payment of fees and taxes our subrogation and salvage practices and our handling of diminution of value claims our assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies our insurance product design our premium actions in response to the covid19 pandemic rating practices certain marketing sales services implementation and renewal practices and procedures including with respect to accessibility our snapshot program certain relationships with independent insurance agents patent matters alleged violation of the telephone consumer protection act commercial disputes including breach of contract and certain employment practices including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices among other matters additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices or operations in addition lawsuits have been filed against our competitors and other businesses or entities and other such lawsuits may be filed in the future and where we are not a party

to such litigation the results of those lawsuits nevertheless may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business practices or operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices in addition the resolution of individual or class actions collective actions and representative action litigation in insurance in related fields or in matters broadly applicable to business operations may lead to the development of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on the risks of pending litigation see note 12 – litigation in the annual report 

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems and that we rely on thirdparty systems and applications to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyberattacks” by third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities which are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

• steal corrupt or destroy data including our intellectual property financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees 

• misappropriate funds or extract ransom payments 

• disrupt or shut down our systems 

• deny customers agents brokers or others access to our systems or 

• infect our systems with viruses or malware 

some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack and although we may review and assess thirdparty vendor cyber security controls our efforts may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of such events thirdparty risks may include among other factors the vendor’s lax security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures our systems are being threatened on a regular basis we have experienced minor incidents in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing future attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

 19  

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions and the operation of various thirdparty systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities or the inability of large numbers of our employees to communicate in a largely workfromhome environment for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a thirdparty system for any reason or a determination by a vendor to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill catastrophe events that affect one of our larger office locations or one or more of our key vendors or that directly or indirectly impact a significant number of our employees working from home may heighten this risk 

efforts to acquire or develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and may create enhanced risks 

we have acquired and are developing and may develop or acquire in the future new insurance products including those that insure risks that we have not previously insured contain new coverages or change coverage terms as well as new noninsurance products and services these new products and services may not be as profitable as our existing products and may not perform as well as we expect in addition new insurance products may entail new risks for us including without limitation higher coverage limits and unfamiliar pricing claims resolution and loss reserving practices other new products and services may likewise change our risk exposures the business systems data and models we use to manage those exposures may be less accurate or less effective than those we use with existing products 

we are evaluating other business models both insurance and noninsurance related and we have made and are considering making additional investments in different business areas these activities may take the form of internal development equity investments targeted mergers or acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships these new ventures may require us to make significant expenditures which may negatively impact our results in the near term and if not successful could materially and adversely affect our results of operations while at the onset of the venture we would expect these projects to provide longterm value there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 

as a result of business acquisitions we have recorded goodwill generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and certain intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition and we may record additional goodwill and intangible assets in the future we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting in asset writedowns goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

 20  

iv market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

• interest rate risk  the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixedincome securities as a result of increases in market interest rates 

• investment credit risk  the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition operating performance or business prospects of the regulatory environment applicable to or the liquidity available to one or more issuers of those securities or in the case of assetbacked securities due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities 

• concentration risk  the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers sectors or industries which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of the regulatory environment applicable to or outlook for those issuers sectors or industries 

• prepayment or extension risk  applicable to certain securities in the portfolio such as residential mortgagebacked securities and other bonds with call provisions prepayment risk is the risk that as interest rates change the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates 

• liquidity risk  discussed separately below 

in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

our common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index although from time to time we may choose to add exchange traded funds or similar securities designed to track the russell 1000 or the standard  poor’s 500 sp 500 index our equity investment strategies may not successfully replicate the performance of the indexes that they seek to track our equity investments are also subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio or exchange traded fund that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or sp 500 is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and they are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 and sp 500 indexes are generally considered to be broadly diversified significant portions of each index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  investments in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2021 and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio 

 21  

new regulations and societal pressures relating to environmental social and other public policy matters could negatively impact our returns or cause us to change our investing strategies in ways that could negatively impact our results 

the value of securities held in our portfolio could be materially adversely impacted as issuers or the businesses or assets underlying such securities are faced with new laws or regulations or initiatives by investors activists or others including those addressing environmental social and other public policy concerns similarly the universe of securities that we are permitted to hold could be significantly narrowed by insurance regulators if for example we are prohibited from investing in certain industries or types of companies or regulators could require that the acquisition of such securities be accompanied by additional disclosures we could also face pressure from other stakeholders to refrain from investing in certain industries or types of companies these factors could cause a decline in the value of investments held in our portfolio or cause us to change our investment strategy which could increase our costs and reduce our returns relative to returns from other available investment opportunities 

the elimination of the london interbank offered rate libor may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain floating rate securities and other instruments that we hold 

libor a common benchmark interest rate or reference rate used to set and make adjustments to interest rates for certain floating rate securities and other financial instruments is being phased out over time although instruments issued in 2022 should no longer tie interest rates to libor securities issued in 2021 and earlier and held in our portfolio may continue to do so as the phase out continues these legacy securities may be adversely affected if they either do not provide for the automatic substitution of another reference rate or convert to another reference rate or a fixed rate that could be less favorable to us outstanding securities and contracts that could be affected include certain preferred stocks and other floating rate securities fixed rate securities that may convert to liborbased floating rate instruments in the future and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to libor any uncertainty regarding the reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate until the end of the phase out period could also adversely affect the value of those instruments 

v liquidity risk 

the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed whether due to our own systems difficulties an institutionspecific issue at the bank or financial institution such as a cybersecurity breach a broader disruption in banking financial or wire transfer systems or otherwise our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our business could be materially adversely affected likewise our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

vi credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business including under certain government programs become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including indemnification and selfinsured retention obligations of commercial lines customers reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of or otherwise become unwilling or unable to satisfy their obligations under their respective contracts we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

 22  

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

• insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 

• insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company 

• competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings and 

• in certain jurisdictions prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities including the parent holding company 

the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from paying a dividend on our common shares in certain circumstances 

the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on our common shares while our preferred shares are outstanding unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares including the full dividends for all current dividend periods have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for payment thereof set apart subject to certain exceptions 

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our equity or debt securities could fall significantly 

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition from time to time we may enter into certain derivative transactions providing that a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction standard  poor’s has recently proposed changes to its process for credit ratings for the insurance industry and we are unable to predict the impact to our credit ratings or our ability to raise capital at favorable rates of any change that they may ultimately adopt downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

 23  

our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to our common shareholders or no payment in some periods and the dividend policy ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have announced our intention to pay a dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis and to consider paying a variable dividend on at least an annual basis the frequency and amount of dividends if any may vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in preceding periods in addition the board retains the discretion to alter our policy or not to pay such dividends at any time such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate the anticipated tax benefits and related returns 

we may invest in certain projects that we believe are entitled to taxadvantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law including renewable energy development historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing and we may make other taxadvantaged investments from time to time our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and in some cases through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project these investments are subject to the risk that the underlying tax credits and related benefits may not be valid and in some cases previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied many of the factors that could lead to the invalidity challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

vii other 

the outbreak of the novel coronavirus or covid19 and the restrictions put in place to help slow andor stop the spread of the virus and its variants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the spread of covid19 and its variants throughout the united states and the international community has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets general economic conditions and certain of our businesses depending on the duration and severity of the coronavirus pandemic and the nature and extent of governmental responses to the pandemic our businesses our operations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in a number of ways including the following 

• demand for our insurance products and our premium revenue could be reduced perhaps significantly if customers drive less or are unable to afford insurance insurance shopping patterns are disrupted vehicle and home purchases are curtailed small businesses suspend or discontinue operations the usage of transportation network company businesses continues to be below historic levels insurance agencies are unable or unwilling to write business or our competitors offer products or benefits more appealing to customers or agents or more responsive to their needs among other factors 

• our ability to price our products accurately for new and renewal policies could be negatively impacted as could our ability to respond effectively to the initiatives of our competitors 

• claims trends could become more volatile inflation rates could diverge significantly from our expectations vehicle and home repair industries could be significantly disrupted and the availability of medical resources could be limited potentially resulting in higher claims severity and increased costs to resolve claims 

• our ability to resolve claims accurately and efficiently and establish accurate loss reserves could be impaired if we are unable to staff our claims group appropriately 

• legislative or regulatory actions or court decisions could impact our business in unexpected ways including without limitation by requiring us to change the way we price segment underwrite or select risks to insure altering our rights and obligations under our issued policies or imposing payment obligations on us and other insurers in our industry for losses and costs that otherwise would be uninsured 

• the cumulative costs required by such governmental actions or of actions taken voluntarily by us to accommodate the needs of customers including providing credits or other payments to policyholders and billing leniency efforts such as providing relief from policy cancellations or nonrenewals and related debt write offs could be substantial 

• unexpected changes in consumer behavior or market conditions as well as deteriorating economic conditions may reduce the effectiveness of our advertising 

• illnesses suffered by key employees could prevent or delay the performance of critical business and financial reporting functions widespread illnesses suffered by our employees may render us unable to perform normal business functions and operate our business on a daytoday basis 

 24  

• the continued functioning of our data centers and important information technology and communication systems as well as the continued performance of and our accessibility to the systems of our various vendors could be imperiled by widespread illnesses illnesses suffered by key technology personnel or work limitations or other governmental mandates 

• our business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address the business challenges that we confront as these issues develop 

• workplace policies adopted in response to the pandemic may be viewed adversely by our employees or the public resulting in damage to our reputation and brand 

• our vendors and counterparties to various contracts including key vendors for our insurance claims and technology operations reinsurance arrangements and financial counterparties may not be able to perform or pay the obligations required of them on a timely basis or at all due to key employee illnesses widespread illnesses adverse financial impact or other challenges that they face arising directly or indirectly from the coronavirus pandemic 

the potential effects of covid19 also could exacerbate the impacts of many of the other risk factors including litigation claims being brought against the company data security breaches and cyber attacks in the workfromhome environment the valuation volatility and liquidity of our debt and equity investment portfolios the condition of domestic and global economies and financial markets our ability to access capital markets at favorable rates if needed our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business and the need to take impairments of goodwill or certain intangible assets 

our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise and we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations which may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of any dividend that may be paid due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business decisions and strategies and establish related financial goals that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance and value while understanding that such decisions and strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit dividend payouts or earnings per share we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our equity or debt securities our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise similar tradeoffs may be involved in our consideration of the interests of other stakeholders including our employees customers agents suppliers and communities as well as whether and how we respond to or address corporate environmental and social responsibility initiatives and other public policy matters that impact us also social responsibility and public policy considerations are a fastevolving area and determining appropriate responses and actions can be uncertain depending on how observers view our responses or our commitment to addressing such matters we could be subject to criticism adverse publicity or campaigns by investors activists or others consequently such factors and the related tradeoffs may adversely affect our financial performance or the market prices of our equity or debt securities

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles which we refer to as our special lines products this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group as of december 31 2020 we wrote personal auto insurance in all 50 states and the district of columbia and we wrote the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states the personal lines business accounted for 82 of our total net premiums written in 2020 and 83 in both 2019 and 2018 

the personal lines segment consists of personal auto and special lines products 

• personal auto insurance represented approximately 94 of our total personal lines net premiums written in 2020 2019 and 2018 we ranked third in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2019 based on premiums written and we believe we continued to hold that position for 2020 there are approximately 290 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 16 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 25 billion of premiums annually comprise about 80 of this market all industry data including ranking and market share based on premiums written has been obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

• special lines products which include insurance for motorcycles atvs rvs watercraft snowmobiles and similar items represented the remaining personal lines net premiums written for the years mentioned above due to the seasonal nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 and that we are one of the largest providers of specialty rv and boat insurance

• in our agency channel we offer customers the opportunity to bundle our auto and progressive home offerings 

• to further drive bundling in the agency channel we offer the platinum program to those select agents who have the appropriate customers for our bundled offering this program combines our auto and home insurance with compensation coordinated policy periods single event deductible and other features that meet the needs and desires that our agents have expressed as of december 31 2020 we had 3976 platinum agents

• our special lines products and umbrella insurance can be combined with any of the auto home or renters coverages that we offer in either the direct or agency channel 

commercial lines 

the commercial lines segment writes autorelated primary liability and physical damage insurance and businessrelated general liability and property insurance each predominately for small businesses this business represented 13 of our total net premiums written in both 2020 and 2019 and 12 in 2018 the following discussion excludes transportation network company tnc business unless otherwise noted 

we offer our auto products in 50 states and do not currently write our auto products in the district of columbia our commercial lines auto customers insure approximately two vehicles on average we continue to write about 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel 

there are approximately 335 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 50 other large companiesgroups each with over 200 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 80 of this market our commercial lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2019 based on premiums written and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2020 

the commercial lines business operates in the following commercial auto business market targets 

• business auto – autos vans pickup trucks used by small businesses such as retailing farming services and private trucking and forhire livery nonfleet ie five or fewer vehicles taxis blackcar services and airport taxis 

• forhire transportation – tractors trailers and straight trucks primarily used by regional general freight and expeditortype businesses and longhaul operators 

• contractor – vans pickup trucks and dump trucks used by small businesses such as artisans heavy construction and landscaperssnowplowers 

• forhire specialty – dump trucks log trucks and garbage trucks used by dirt sand and gravel logging and coaltype businesses and 

• tow – tow trucks and wreckers used in towing services and gasservice station businesses 

as with our personal auto products we regularly introduce new commercial auto product models designed to improve our pricing accuracy and competitiveness through improved segmentation the use of additional risk variables and other enhancements new models are typically rolled out on a statebystate basis and as a result we often have more than one product version in the marketplace at a time 

similar to snapshot in the personal auto business the commercial lines business offers its customers usagebased insurance ubi options smart haul ®  is the ubi program that uses driving data from a motor carriers’ existing electronic logging device smart haul allows owner operators and small fleets to earn discounts for agreeing to share their electronic logging device generated data with us snapshot proview ®  which was launched in 2020 is the ubi program for commercial auto customers without their own electronic logging device snapshot proview allows customers to earn upfront discounts and provides valueadd services like fleet management and personalized tips to encourage safe driving at yearend 2020 both programs were available in 45 states and we plan to expand to more states in 2021 

 3  

we offer general liability and property insurance through our business owners policy bop insurance this product is geared specifically to small businesses and is currently available to agents in 17 states with plans to expand to additional states during 2021 we also continue to act as an agent for business customers to place bop general liability professional liability and workers’ compensation coverage through unaffiliated insurance carriers and are compensated through commissions which are reported as service revenues to further help our direct customers we offer businessquote explorer ® bqx a digital application that allows small business owners to obtain quotes for our bop product and the products offered from a select group of unaffiliated carriers 

in addition we provide commercial auto coverage in the tnc business to uber technologies subsidiaries in 13 states and to lyft’s rideshare operations in 7 states and in the district of columbia tnc represented about 4 of our commercial lines net premiums written for 2020 and 7 for 2019 premiums written in our tnc business are determined in part by estimating the number of miles to be driven over the life of the policy term six or twelve months on a policybypolicy basis these premium estimates are adjusted monthly based both on actual miles driven and an estimate of miles to be driven during the remaining policy term during 2020 due to social distancing and other restrictions put in place to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus actual miles driven and new mileage forecasts decreased significantly from 2019 levels resulting in the decrease in net premiums written in our tnc business 

property 

our property segment writes residential property insurance in 45 states and the district of columbia and renters insurance in 46 states and the district of columbia primarily in the independent agency channel and through select agents under our platinum program to drive home and auto bundling we also act as a participant in the “write your own” program for the national flood insurance program under which we write flood insurance in 45 states and the district of columbia 100 of this business is reinsured 

our property business represented about 5 of our total net premiums written in both 2020 and 2018 and 4 in 2019 we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters of the year based on the cyclical nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent as a property insurer we have exposure to losses from catastrophes including hurricanes and other severe storms to help mitigate these risks we enter into reinsurance arrangements see the “reinsurance” section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs 

as one of the 15 largest homeowners carriers in the united states we specialize in property insurance for homes condos manufactured homes and renters as well as personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 380 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide and we compete with many of these companies the top 15 carriers each with over 1 billion of premiums written annually comprise about 70 of the market 

as discussed above our property business is an important component of our destination era strategy 

reinsurance 

we cede a portion of our direct premiums written to regulated reinsurance plans we participate in several mandatory state pools including the michigan catastrophic claims association florida hurricane catastrophe fund and north carolina reinsurance facility we also act as servicing agent for statemandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles caip plans and as a participant in the “write your own” program for federally regulated plans for flood national flood insurance program all of these programs are governed by insurance regulations 

we also have voluntary contractual arrangements that primarily relate to the property business and to our tnc and bop products written by our commercial lines business the reinsurance program in our property business is designed to reduce overall risk while to the extent of coverage purchased protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophes and severe storms 

for the tnc business we have quota share reinsurance agreements and for our bop products we have excess of loss reinsurance agreements with certain bop coverages having quota share agreements under each agreement we cede a portion of premiums losses and loss adjustment expenses cession rates for our tnc business vary by state a portion of the reinsurance is written through reinsurers that are owned by the tnc companies and these recoverables are collateralized at a target of over 100 the remaining portion of reinsurance for the tnc business is written by a panel of thirdparty reinsurers which are rated “a” or better by am best 

 4  

our property business has occurrence excess of loss reinsurance and new for 2020 an aggregate excess of loss program the occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital while sustaining at least two oneinone hundred year events in a single contract period it contains several layers privatelyplaced reinsurance a catastrophe bond and coverage obtained through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund among other arrangements the program includes layers that are purchased for multiyear periods and layers as to which we have prepaid premiums for reinstatement of coverage after the first covered event to ensure coverage for the second event under the current program we are responsible for the first 80 million of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae from each event we may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum limits of the reinsurance coverage that is then in place coverage limits for a first event in florida would be 195 billion while coverage for a first event outside of florida would be 155 billion coverage for a second event and potentially for subsequent covered events would depend on a number of factors including the severity and location of the earlier events in the contract period we expect that in mid2021 our retention threshold for this program will increase to at least 100 million and that the maximum coverage limits may also be increased subject to our ongoing negotiations with reinsurers 

included in the 2020 occurrence excess of loss program is 200 million of reinsurance coverage provided through a catastrophe bond transaction that replaced a similar bond that expired on december 31 2019 the bond provides reinsurance coverage in the event that a single catastrophe event in florida exceeds the 155 billion in coverage while coverage for a single catastrophe event outside of florida would be 115 billion provided by our occurrence catastrophe reinsurance program effective june 1 2021 we have an additional 200 million catastrophe bond that expands our coverage 

in addition during 2020 we had a property catastrophe aggregate excess of loss program this agreement contains two layers each with a retention threshold of 375 million the first layer provides 130 million of coverage for catastrophe losses and alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms the second layer provides 70 million for our retained losses and alae from both named and nonnamed storms the first layer does not have to be exhausted before the second layer can be applied 

on january 1 2021 we entered into a new aggregate excess of loss program with three layers the first layer has a retention threshold of 475 million and provides 75 million of coverage for catastrophe losses and alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms the second layer has a retention threshold of 550 million and provides 50 million of coverage on losses and alae from both named and nonnamed storms the third layer has a retention threshold of 600 million and provides 100 million of coverage which includes 95 million under the catastrophe bond on losses and alae from both named and nonnamed storms to the extent losses are in excess of the coverages provided under the first two layers each layer is subject to a per occurrence 2 million deductible before each loss could be considered for aggregate retention and each event is subject to a 98 million coverage cap the first layer does not have to be exhausted before the second or third layer can be applied however the second layer must be exhausted before the third layer can be applied 

for example under the 2021 aggregate excess of loss program if we incurred aggregate nonnamed catastrophe losses and alae in excess of the 2 million deductible on each loss of 450 million and named storm losses of 150 million we would have no reinsurance coverage under the first layer since the nonnamed catastrophe losses did not exceed the retention threshold however we would recognize a reinsurance recoverable of 50 million under the second layer representing the amount our total losses of 600 million 450 million of nonnamed and 150 million of named catastrophe losses exceeded the 550 million retention threshold 

for accident years 2017 to 2019 we have aggregate stoploss reinsurance agreements asl with substantially the same terms from year to year these agreements cover accident year property losses and certain alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms and liability claims for business written by arx subsidiaries that write property business as such these agreements provide protection for losses and alae incurred by our property business in the ordinary course including those resulting from other significant severe weather events such as hail tornadoes etc these agreements provide 200 million of coverage to the extent that the net loss and alae ratio for the full accident year exceeds 63 the asl reduced the likelihood that we would experience a net underwriting loss for reasons other than named storms and liability claims the asl agreement for 2019 accident year losses has substantially the same terms as those discussed above for the 2017 and 2018 agreements with the exception that the 2019 asl also covers an additional 100 million of retained losses and alae from named storms 

the reinsurance programs in our property business are with unaffiliated reinsurance companies most of which are rated “a” or better by am best

claims 

our employees handle our personal and commercial lines claims from claims offices located throughout the united states supported by centralized functions at our corporate offices and a nationwide network of just over 2500 thirdparty repair shops for our property business we manage a majority of our claims through a network of independent claims field adjusters with internal claims representatives managing the overall claims process as of december 31 2020 we employed about 550 internal property claim representatives and about 140 staff field adjusters we plan to continue to increase our internal claims staff in 2021 

competitive factors 

the insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology to operate our business and on extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies highquality customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is also affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we sustain security breaches or other “cyber attacks” on our systems or are unable to maintain uninterrupted access to our systems business functions and the systems of certain thirdparty providers see item 1a risk factors  for more information 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry some of our competitors have many more patents than we do some of the patents we currently hold include a usagebased insurance patent expiring in 2024 or after two patents for the system we use for securing esignature transactions expiring in 2025 or after two us patents on the name your price ® functionality on our website expiring in 2028 or after three multiproduct quoting patents expiring in 2032 or after two patents for our implementation of a mobile insurance platform and architecture expiring in 2032 or after a patent on our system of providing customized insurance quotes based on a user’s price andor coverage preferences expiring in 2033 or after two patents for our loyalty call routing system expiring in 2033 or after a patent for a multivariate predictive system that processes usagebased data expiring in 2035 or after and three patents for the implementation of chatbots in online quoting and servicing expiring in 2038 and 2039 or after 

we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 35 billion driving miles derived from our usagebased devices and our mobile app we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

 6  

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of california delaware florida illinois indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws we also have a subsidiary that writes excess and surplus lines these activities do not require a license but are regulated 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

• licensing of insurers and agents 

• capital and surplus requirements 

• statutory accounting principles specific to insurance companies and the content of required financial and other reports 

• requirements for establishing insurance reserves 

• investments 

• acquisitions of insurers and transactions between insurers and their affiliates 

• limitations on rates of return or profitability 

• rating criteria rate levels and rate changes 

• insolvencies of insurance companies 

• assigned risk programs 

• authority to exit a business and 

• numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations including required coverages policy forms underwriting standards and claims handling 

insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance which is the target for our vehicle businesses our property business maintains a lower premiumstosurplus ratio thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2020 we had net premiums written of 406 billion and statutory surplus of 152 billion the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 27 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2020 we had access to 62 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes in january 2021 we used the proceeds from the sale of 27 billion of these securities to pay our common share dividends 

the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is determined by a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2020 our rbc ratios were in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

• the insurer’s financial statements under statutory accounting principles 

• details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer 

• specific investments held by the insurer and 

 7  

• numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations 

state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see note 8 – statutory financial information in our annual report for further discussion 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of unfairdiscriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information cybersecurity use of credit and other information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the federal insurance office is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

investments 

our investment portfolio which had a fair value of 475 billion at december 31 2020 compared to 393 billion at december 31 2019 consists of fixedmaturity securities shortterm investments and equity securities nonredeemable preferred stocks and common equity securities our fixedmaturity securities shortterm investments and nonredeemable preferred stocks are collectively referred to as fixedincome securities our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors for securities related to our investment portfolios total investment income includes interest and dividends net realized gains losses on securities sold and net holding period gains losses on securities which for 2020 and 2019 was composed primarily of valuation changes on equity securities total investment income before expenses and taxes was 25666 million in 2020 compared to 21345 million in 2019 and 4833 million in 2018 for our investment portfolio on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in net unrealized gains losses investment income was 33138 million 27281 million and 3575 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively outside of our investment portfolio but reported in impairment losses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income were 633 million and 683 million of otherthantemporary impairment

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

• commercial automobile insurance proceduresplans caip – we are the only servicing carrier on a nationwide basis for caip plans which are statesupervised plans servicing the involuntary market in 43 states and the district of columbia as a service provider we provide policy issuance and claims adjusting services and collect fee revenue reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations subject to contractual service standards our current caip service contract administered through the automobile insurance plan services office will expire in 2022 we currently do not intend to renew this contract any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

• commissionbased businesses – we act as an agent for other insurance companies we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by unaffiliated insurance companies in the continental united states in the direct channel we also offer our customers the ability to package their commercial auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae which include alae and defense and cost containment expenses of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or ibnr are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors 

these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

see note 6 – loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the annual report for a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices and a reconciliation of our loss and lae reserve activity along with incurred and paid claims development by accident year for our segments based on definitions pursuant to statutory accounting principles

our culture and success have enabled us to attract and retain highly talented people from a diverse marketplace we employ expansive recruiting practices to ensure we have qualified and deep candidate pools and are attracting candidates from both established and new sources we hired more than 5500 new employees in 2020 representing about 35 of the total applicants for a job at progressive 

we understand that engaged employees are more productive provide better service to our customers and are more likely to stay with progressive each year we survey our people to measure their engagement we use the results along with other feedback to evaluate our human capital strategies and the health of our culture 

our formal performance evaluation process is focused on coaching and development which we believe encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance moreover we actively foster a learning culture and offer several leadership development programs including our multicultural leadership development program formal training which covers a broad swath of competencies and skills is available for both new and tenured employees and for both individual contributors and leaders 

promoting from within is a key part of our strategy many of our leaders including current executive team members joined progressive in a junior position and advanced to significant leadership positions within the organization in 2020 we filled approximately 78 of our open jobs above the entry level by promoting our own talent including just under 900 manager positions 

our annualized employee retention rate for 2020 was 91 and as of december 31 2020 just under 15000 of our employees had more than 10 years of tenure at the company 

ethics and compliance 

our core values are the foundation for our code of business conduct and ethics which provides clear expectations for all our people and confirms our commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with legal requirements we provide ethics training as well as regular communications video series and outside speakers presenting themes such as courage at our core and dare to disagree to emphasize our commitment to our ethical and legal responsibilities additionally we have an “open door” policy that empowers every employee to reach out to any manager or any hr representative when they have a question or a concern or they want to share an idea we also provide a confidential alertline that is available for employees and others who want to raise a concern anonymously we encourage our people to speak up and when they do we review their concerns take remedial action where appropriate and do not discriminate or retaliate against them for reporting any concern to us in good faith 

competitive pay and benefits 

we seek to provide competitive pay through a combination of fixed and variable compensation we publish internally the salary range and annual cash incentive target for each of our positions as well as our assessment of the median pay in the market for comparable jobs all progressive people participate in our annual gainshare bonus program which measures the growth and profitability of our insurance businesses we believe gainshare contributes to the cooperative and collaborative way we work together and in part defines our culture our executives and other senior leaders also receive compensation in the form of equity awards which we believe supports a strong payforperformance linkage and further aligns their interests with those of our shareholders we monitor pay equity among employees with similar performance experience and job responsibilities and publish the results annually on our website 

our employee benefits are intended to be competitive and to support the needs of our people and their families we invest in the physical emotional and financial health of progressive people by providing a broad range of benefits including medical prescription drug dental and vison benefits a 401k plan with up to a 6 company match life insurance long and shortterm disability insurance and paid parental leave we also support flexible work arrangements and paid time off to help our people balance their work and personal lives

covid responses 

we took a number of steps during 2020 to support our people during the pandemic for the health and safety of our employees we quickly moved as many employees as possible to work from home and implemented additional cleaning and physical distancing protocols at our offices recognizing the economic challenges faced by some of our people we also made advances on gainshare bonus payments to most of our employees but not our executives or other senior leaders we established an employee relief fund to help our people dealing with financial difficulties and provided additional paid time off to employees who needed to care for themselves or family members we also used various health and wellness communications events and activities to address the related anxiety and mental health stress our people may have experienced as a result of the pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

i summary 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives our risk categories include 

• insurance risks  risks associated with assuming or indemnifying for the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders 

• operating risks  risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations 

• market risks  risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios 

• liquidity risk  risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability to meet our shortterm cash collateral or other financial obligations and 

• credit and other financial risks  risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary 

we have also included a “general” section in the discussion below 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold technological advances home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our equity or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time

ii insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents other insured events and associated losses and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events loss costs expenses and inflation among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

• the availability of sufficient reliable data 

• our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data 

• uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions generally 

• our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy 

• our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy 

• our ability to reflect changes in reinsurance costs in a timely manner 

• the development selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies 

• our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies 

• our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis 

• our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately 

• unanticipated court decisions legislation or regulatory actions 

• the frequency severity duration and geographic location and scope of catastrophe events 

• our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices 

• changing vehicle usage and driving patterns which may be influenced by oil and gas prices among other factors changes in residential occupancy patterns and the emerging sharing economy 

• advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles 

• unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations 

• unforeseen disruptive technologies and events 

• the ability to understand the risk profile of significant customers such as transportation network companies and 

• unanticipated changes in auto repair costs auto parts prices used car prices or construction requirements or labor and materials costs or the imposition and impacts of tariffs 

we are seeing various legislative and regulatory challenges political initiatives and other societal pressures that seek to limit or prohibit the use of specific rating factors in insurance policy pricing in our view such efforts may undermine the effectiveness of riskbased pricing if we are unable to use rating factors that we believe are highly predictive of risk we may not be able to as accurately match insurance rates to the applicable risks which may significantly adversely impact our insurance operating results 

the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 13  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

• the availability of sufficient reliable data 

• the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends including the effects of future inflation rates for multiple products in multiple markets 

• unexpected changes in medical costs auto repair costs or the costs of construction labor and materials and the imposition and impacts of tariffs 

• unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations 

• new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coveragerelated issues by courts 

• the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices 

• our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims 

• the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements 

• the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves and 

• the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims 

the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather or other catastrophe events and changing climate conditions may be exacerbating these impacts 

our insurance operating results have periodically been and in the future could be materially adversely affected by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks cyber attacks epidemics pandemics riots and hazardous material releases the frequency severity duration and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur how long they last and how much insured damage they cause and may change where the events occur catastrophe losses have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe event is a function of our total insured exposure in the area affected by the event the nature severity and duration of the event and the extent of reinsurance that we have obtained with respect to such an event we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency severity or duration or unanticipated changes in geographic location or scope of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines businesses including our business owners’ policies and the transportation network company business and our umbrella insurance business reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we remain liable under our policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute our reinsurance claims further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance 

 14  

market conditions which have been and in the future could be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events such as catastrophes we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the unavailability andor cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition 

iii operating risks 

we compete in property and casualty insurance markets that are highly competitive 

the markets in which we sell insurance are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other companies potentially including existing insurance companies vehicle manufacturing companies other wellfinanced companies seeking new opportunities or new competitors with technological or other innovations also have entered these markets and may continue to do so in the future many of our competitors have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills innovation operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time such as advances in vehicle technology autonomous or semiautonomous vehicles or vehicle sharing arrangements 

we expect similar and perhaps greater competitive pressures with respect to any new insurance or noninsurance businesses that we decide to enter in the future in such cases we would be selling products or services that are new to us while our competitors could include large wellfinanced companies with significant product and marketing experience in such businesses 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again the ability to discern at any point in time whether we are in a “hard” or “soft” market is often difficult as such a conclusion represents an assessment of innumerable data points including among others the operating results of and the dynamic competitive actions taken by us and many competitors in multiple markets involving a variety of products often detailed information on our competitors becomes available on a delayed basis and the nature of the market becomes apparent only in retrospect our ability to predict future competitive conditions is also constrained as a result 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of insurance business in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed and agility the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

 15  

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver highquality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our businesses these risks include our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems including “cloud computing” environments and applications the development of new modes of communication changing insurance shopping trends our understanding of the operations and needs of significant customers and the availability of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets complexity may among other potential difficulties create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences with the speed and agility that may be required require us to modify our business practices adopt new systems or upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and lead to increased difficulty in 

executing our business strategies 

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights from time to time has resulted in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

we have made significant investments in our brand over many years and we believe it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to maintain and improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that maintaining and improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by situations that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices adverse financial developments perceptions of our corporate governance or how we address environmental or social responsibility initiatives the conduct of our officers directors or employees the actions of a significant customer or other businesses with which we do business including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as consumers and other stakeholders increase or change their expectations regarding the conduct of large public companies sustainability efforts and corporate responsibility these impacts may be further complicated such that perceptions are formed through rapid and broad interactions using modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control any such event could decrease demand for our products reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees and lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our businesses 

 16  

our ability to attract develop and retain talent including employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses and assess potential expansion into new products and business areas our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or retain talented executives managers and employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business to the extent other us companies are or become more willing to allow job functions to be performed remotely it could undermine our ability to attract and retain talent with needed skills and experiences 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and we must adapt to increases in business due to additions of or expansions with significant customers such as transportation network companies in any such case we must adjust our hiring and training programs and staffing levels appropriately our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

we use thirdparty labor to meet a portion of our staffing needs any significant loss in access to qualified external talent on a costeffective basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information methods of customer communications employment practices and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things an insurer’s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable businesses prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs for us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including potentially material assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

in addition data privacy and security regulations impose complex compliance and reporting requirements and challenges for example the california consumer privacy act which was passed by a consumer initiative in 2018 was amended in 2020 to afford california residents additional rights compliance with this new legislation will be challenging and is expected to require further modifications to our business systems and operations with a january 1 2023 effective date other states have enacted or 

 17  

are considering privacy and security legislation or regulations each state’s unique requirements and the variations across the states present further ongoing compliance challenges compliance with these laws and regulations will result in increased costs which may be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in certain jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in classcollectiverepresentative actions and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of among other things our subsidiaries’ methods used for evaluating and paying medical or injury claims or benefits including but not limited to certain bodily injury personal injury protection uninsured motoristunderinsured motorist umuim and medical payment claims and for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicaremedicaid beneficiaries other claims handling procedures including but not limited to challenges relating to our network of repair facilities our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles our payment of fees and taxes our subrogation practices and our handling of diminution of value claims our assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies rating practices certain policy marketing sales services implementation and renewal practices and procedures including with respect to accessibility our snapshot program certain relationships with independent insurance agents patent matters and certain employment practices including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices among other matters additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices in addition the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on the risks of pending litigation see note 12 – litigation in the annual report 

 18  

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems and that we rely on thirdparty systems and applications to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

• steal corrupt or destroy data including our intellectual property financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees 

• misappropriate funds or extract ransom payments 

• disrupt or shut down our systems 

• deny customers agents brokers or others access to our systems or 

• infect our systems with viruses or malware 

some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack and although we may review and assess thirdparty vendor cyber security controls our efforts may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of such events thirdparty risks may include among other factors the vendor’s lax security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures our systems are being threatened on a regular basis we have experienced minor incidents in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing future attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions and the operation of various thirdparty systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities or the inability of large numbers of our employees to communicate in our current workfromhome environment for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a thirdparty system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill 

 19  

efforts to develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and may create enhanced risks 

we are developing and may develop or acquire in the future new insurance products including those that insure risks that we have not previously insured contain new coverages or change coverage terms as well as new noninsurance products and services these new products and services may not be as profitable as our existing products and may not perform as well as we expect in addition new insurance products may entail new risks for us including without limitation higher coverage limits and unfamiliar pricing claims resolution and loss reserving practices other new products and services may likewise change our risk exposures the business systems data and models we use to manage those exposures may be less accurate or less effective than those we use with existing products 

we are evaluating other business models both insurance and noninsurance related and we have made and are considering making additional investments in different business areas these activities may take the form of internal development equity investments targeted mergers or acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships these new ventures may require us to make significant expenditures which may negatively impact our results in the near term and if not successful could materially and adversely affect our results of operations while at the onset of the venture we would expect these projects to provide longterm value there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 

as a result of business acquisitions we have recorded goodwill generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and certain intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition and we may record additional goodwill and intangible assets in the future we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting in asset writedowns goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

iv market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

• interest rate risk  the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixedincome securities as a result of increases in market interest rates 

• investment credit risk  the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition operating performance or business prospects of or the liquidity available to one or more issuers of those securities or in the case of assetbacked securities due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities 

• concentration risk  the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers sectors or industries which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of or outlook for those issuers sectors or industries 

 20  

• prepayment or extension risk  applicable to certain securities in the portfolio such as residential mortgagebacked securities and other bonds with call provisions prepayment risk is the risk that as interest rates change the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates 

• liquidity risk  discussed separately below 

in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

our common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index although from time to time we may choose to add exchange traded funds or similar securities designed to track the russell 1000 or the standard  poor’s 500 “sp 500” index our equity investment strategies may not successfully replicate the performance of the indexes that they seek to track our equity investments are also subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio or exchange traded fund that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or sp 500 is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and they are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 and sp 500 indexes are generally considered to be broadly diversified significant portions of each index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained 

certain investors and activists have increasingly pressured companies to invest only in companies or industries that they believe to be acceptable or socially responsible as determined by them or thirdparty ratings or reviews and some insurance regulatory authorities have indicated an interest in limiting insurance company investments in generally similar ways it is possible that such investment limitations if required or selected by us will result in investment returns that could be lower than returns from other available investment opportunities 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2020 and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio 

the elimination of or change in the london interbank offered rate libor may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain floating rate securities and other instruments that we hold 

libor is a common benchmark interest rate or reference rate used to set and make adjustments to interest rates for certain floating rate securities and other financial instruments published reports have indicated that regulatory authorities andor financial institutions may change how libor is calculated or discontinue its calculation and publication after 2021 alternative reference rates have been developed including the federal reserve bank of new york’s secured overnight financing rate sofr but the acceptance of such alternative rates and their applicability to existing instruments is uncertain if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason outstanding securities with interest rates tied to libor may be adversely affected if those securities either do not provide for the automatic substitution of another reference rate or convert to another reference rate or a fixed rate that could be less favorable to us outstanding securities and contracts that could be affected include certain preferred stocks and other floating rate securities fixed rate securities that may convert to liborbased floating rate instruments in the future certain derivatives and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to libor any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could also adversely affect the value of those instruments 

 21  

v liquidity risk 

the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed whether due to our own systems difficulties an institutionspecific issue at the bank or financial institution such as a cybersecurity breach a broader disruption in banking financial or wire transfer systems or otherwise our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our business could be materially adversely affected likewise our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

vi credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business including under certain government programs become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

• insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 

• insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company 

• competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings and 

• in certain jurisdictions prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities including the parent holding company 

the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from paying a dividend on our common shares in certain circumstances 

the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on our common shares while our preferred shares are outstanding unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares including the full dividends for all current dividend periods have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for payment thereof set apart subject to certain exceptions 

 22  

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our equity or debt securities could fall significantly 

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition from time to time we may enter into certain derivative transactions providing that a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to our common shareholders or no payment in some periods and the dividend policy ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have announced our intention to pay a dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis and to consider paying a variable dividend on at least an annual basis the frequency and amount of dividends if any may vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in preceding periods in addition the board retains the discretion to alter our policy or not to pay such dividends at any time such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate the anticipated tax benefits and related returns 

we may invest in certain projects that we believe are entitled to taxadvantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law including renewable energy development historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing and we may make other taxadvantaged investments from time to time our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and in some cases through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project these investments are subject to the risk that the underlying tax credits and related benefits may not be valid and in some cases previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied many of the factors that could lead to the invalidity challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition

vii general 

the outbreak of the novel coronavirus or covid19 and the restrictions put in place to help slow andor stop the spread of the virus could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the spread of covid19 throughout the united states and the international community has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets general economic conditions and certain of our businesses depending on the duration and severity of the coronavirus pandemic our businesses our operations and our financial results could be negatively impacted in a number of ways including but not limited to the following 

• demand for our insurance products and our premium revenue could be reduced perhaps significantly if customers drive less or are unable to afford insurance insurance shopping patterns are disrupted vehicle and home purchases are curtailed small businesses suspend or discontinue operations the usage of transportation network company businesses continues to be below historic levels insurance agencies are unable or unwilling to write business or our competitors offer products or benefits more appealing to customers or agents or more responsive to their needs among other factors 

• our ability to price our products accurately for new and renewal policies could be negatively impacted as could our ability to respond effectively to the initiatives of our competitors 

• claims trends could become more volatile inflation rates could diverge significantly from our expectations vehicle and home repair industries could be significantly disrupted and the availability of medical resources could be limited potentially resulting in higher claims severity and increased costs to resolve claims 

• our ability to resolve claims accurately and efficiently and establish accurate loss reserves could be impaired if we are unable to staff our claims group appropriately 

• legislative or regulatory actions or court decisions could impact our business in unexpected ways including without limitation by requiring us to change the way we price segment underwrite or select risks to insure altering our rights and obligations under our issued policies or imposing payment obligations on us and other insurers in our industry for losses and costs that otherwise would be uninsured 

• the cumulative costs required by such governmental actions or of actions taken voluntarily by us to accommodate the needs of customers including but not limited to providing credits or other payments to policyholders and billing leniency efforts such as providing relief from policy cancellations or nonrenewals and related debt write offs could be substantial 

• unexpected changes in consumer behavior or market conditions as well as deteriorating economic conditions may reduce the effectiveness of our advertising 

• illnesses suffered by key employees could prevent or delay the performance of critical business and financial reporting functions widespread illnesses suffered by our employees may render us unable to perform normal business functions and operate our business on a daytoday basis 

• the continued functioning of our data centers and important information technology and communication systems as well as the continued performance of and our accessibility to the systems of our various vendors could be imperiled by widespread illnesses illnesses suffered by key technology personnel or work limitations or other governmental mandates 

• our business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address the business challenges that we confront as these issues develop 

• our vendors and counterparties to various contracts including key vendors for our insurance claims and technology operations reinsurance arrangements and financial counterparties may not be able to perform or pay the obligations required of them on a timely basis or at all due to key employee illnesses widespread illnesses or other challenges that they face arising directly or indirectly from the coronavirus pandemic 

the potential effects of covid19 also could exacerbate the impacts of many of the other risk factors including but not limited to litigation claims being brought against the company data security breaches and cyber attacks in the workfromhome environment the valuation volatility and liquidity of our debt and equity investment portfolios the condition of domestic and global economies and financial markets our ability to access capital markets at favorable rates if needed our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business and the need to take impairments of goodwill or certain intangible assets 

 24  

our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise and we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations which may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of any dividend that may be paid we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our equity or debt securities our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business decisions and strategies and establish related financial goals that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance and value while understanding that such decisions and strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit dividend payouts or earnings per share similar tradeoffs may be involved in our consideration of the interests of other stakeholders including our employees customers agents suppliers and communities as well as whether and how we respond to or address corporate environmental and social responsibility initiatives and other public policy matters that impact us also social responsibility and public policy considerations are a fastevolving area and determining appropriate responses and actions can be uncertain depending on how observers view our responses or our commitment to addressing such matters we could be subject to criticism adverse publicity or campaigns by investors activists or others consequently such factors and the related tradeoffs may adversely affect our financial performance or the market prices of our equity or debt securities

 item 1 business 

general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has insurance and noninsurance subsidiaries and affiliates our insurance subsidiaries and affiliates provide personal and commercial auto insurance personal residential and commercial property insurance general liability insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services our auto insurance products protect our customers against losses due to physical damage to their motor vehicles uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our property insurance products protect our customers against losses due to damages to their structure or possessions within the structure as well as liability for accidents occurring in the structure or on the property our noninsurance subsidiaries and affiliates generally support our insurance and investment operations we operate throughout the united states 

the progressive corporation “progressive” acquired a controlling interest in arx holding corp “arx” in 2015 the parent company of insurance subsidiaries and affiliates that comprise the vast majority of our property segment progressive and the other arx stockholders including stock option holders are parties to a stockholders’ agreement which addresses the parties’ respective rights and obligations among other provisions the stockholders’ agreement allows and in certain circumstances requires progressive to acquire 100 of the outstanding equity of arx by the second quarter of 2021 in february 2020 however progressive and the minority arx shareholders signed a stock purchase agreement that requires progressive to acquire the minority stockholders’ arx shares including those to be issued under outstanding stock options this transaction which remains subject to normal closing conditions would bring progressive’s ownership stake to 100 in april 2020 instead of the second quarter 2021 under the stockholders’ agreement for additional information see note 15 – redeemable noncontrolling interest and note 17 – subsequent event to our financial statements included in our 2019 annual report to shareholders which is filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the “annual report” until progressive owns 100 of the outstanding equity of arx the interests of the minority stockholders in arx’s income and assets are reflected in our financial statements as noncontrolling interest 

narrative description of business 

organization 

our operations are run by our executive team which consists of our chief executive officer and the heads of our major business areas that report to the ceo including a chief financial officer chief legal officer chief information officer chief human resource officer chief marketing officer and chief strategy officer along with the presidents of personal lines commercial lines claims and customer relationship management our chief investment officer reports to our chief financial officer and the head of our property business reports to our president of personal lines 

our insurance and claims organizations are generally managed on a statebystate basis due to the nature of insurance legal and regulatory requirements and other local factors and are supplemented by national operations and supported by our corporate functions statespecific organizations typically report to a regional general manager who then reports to the applicable group president in california we operate a separate agency auto organization with its own management 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles which we refer to as our special lines products this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group as of december 31 2019  we wrote personal auto insurance in all 50 states and the district of columbia and we wrote the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states the personal lines business accounted for 83 of total net premiums written in both 2019 and 2018  and 85 in 2017  

 1  

the personal lines segment consists of personal auto and special lines products 

 our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 our personal lines strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a broad range of personal auto and special lines insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers and combined with property insurance and other products when appropriate to match our customers’ needs volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition quality service and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” below for further discussion 

we seek to refine our personal auto segmentation underwriting models and pricing over time in mid2019 we introduced our next generation auto product and expect to continue to roll this product out during 2020 this product version has improved the accuracy of matching rate to risk and introduced new risk verification variables that we believe has improved our competitiveness especially in more preferred segments 

we continue to provide customers in both the agency and direct channels the opportunity to improve their auto insurance rates based on their personal driving behavior through snapshot ®  our usagebased insurance program we offer snapshot through our traditional hardwarebased version which is available nationwide except for california and north carolina due to the regulatory environment as well as through our mobileapp version which is available in 42 states and the district of columbia this mobile app is intended to improve the user experience while also reducing our monitoring costs in addition to the personal benefits for our customers the data collected via the mobile app affords us a unique perspective on mobile device usage vehicle operations and accidents our next generation auto product model discussed above also included snapshot enhancements to broaden its applicability 

our personal lines business is focused on efforts to form deeper and longerterm relationships with our customers through our destination era strategy through this strategy we seek to leverage our property business as well as insurance and noninsurance products offered by unaffiliated third parties to provide our customers access to a range of products addressing their diverse needs and if the customer chooses to “bundle” certain of the products together bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda customers who prefer to bundle represent a sizable segment of the insurance market and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs our destination era strategy involves a number of initiatives including 

 2  

 commercial lines 

the commercial lines segment writes autorelated primary liability and physical damage insurance and businessrelated general liability and property insurance each predominately for small businesses this business represented 13 of our total net premiums written in 2019  12 in 2018  and 11 in 2017  we offer our auto products in 50 states and do not currently write commercial lines products in the district of columbia our commercial lines auto customers insure approximately two vehicles on average even though we continue to write about 85 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel we are seeing more small business owners purchasing their insurance on a direct basis 

there are approximately 330 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 50 other large companiesgroups each with over 200 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 80 of this market our commercial lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2018 based on premiums written and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2019 

the commercial lines business operates in the following commercial auto business market targets 

 in late 2019 we introduced our next generation commercial auto product and expect to continue to roll this product out through 2020 and beyond this product version continues to improve our pricing accuracy through segmentation 

 3  

during 2019 we increased our participation in the transportation network company tnc business where we provide commercial auto coverage we currently provide this coverage to uber technologies subsidiaries in 13 states and to lyft’s rideshare operations in 3 states tnc is a growing and important part of our business and represented about 7 of our commercial lines net premiums written for 2019 with profitability that continues to meet our internal expectations we plan to expand this part of our business where we are able to do so 

during 2019 we launched our business owners policy bop insurance offering general liability and property insurance this product is geared specifically to small businesses and currently available to agents in eight states with plans to expand to additional states during the remainder of 2020 we also continue to act as an agent for business customers to place bop general liability professional liability and workers’ compensation coverage through unaffiliated insurance carriers and are compensated through commissions which are reported as service revenues to further help our direct customers we offer businessquote explorer ® bqx a digital application that allows small business owners to obtain quotes for these products from a select group of unaffiliated carriers we plan to add our bop product to our bqx platform later in 2020 

similar to snapshot in the personal auto business the commercial lines business continues to invest in smart haul ®  a usagebased insurance program for motor carriers smart haul allows owner operators to earn discounts for agreeing to share their electronic logging device generated data with us smart haul is currently available in 45 states 

property 

our property segment which we began reporting in 2015 after we acquired a majority interest in arx writes residential property insurance in 44 states and the district of columbia and renters insurance in 45 states and the district of columbia primarily in the independent agency channel and through select agents under our platinum program to drive home and auto bundling we also act as a participant in the “write your own” program for the national flood insurance program under which we write flood insurance in 44 states and the district of columbia 

our property business represented about 4 of our total net premiums written in both 2019 and 2017  and 5 in 2018  we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters of the year based on the cyclical nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent as a property insurer we have exposure to losses from catastrophes including hurricanes and other severe storms to help mitigate these risks we enter into reinsurance arrangements see the “reinsurance” section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs 

as one of the 15 largest homeowners carriers in the united states we specialize in property insurance for homes condos manufactured homes and renters as well as personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 380 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide and we compete with many of these companies the top 15 carriers comprise about 70 of the market 

as discussed above our property business is an important component of our destination era strategy

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 reinsurance 

we cede a portion of our direct premiums written to regulated reinsurance plans we participate in several mandatory state pools including the michigan catastrophic claims association florida hurricane catastrophe fund and north carolina reinsurance facility we also act as servicing agent for statemandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles caip plans and as a participant in the “write your own” program for federally regulated plans for flood national flood insurance program all of these programs are governed by insurance regulations 

we also have voluntary contractual arrangements that primarily relate to the property business and to our transportation network company tnc business written by our commercial lines business the reinsurance program in our property business is designed to reduce overall risk while to the extent of coverage purchased protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophes and severe storms the largest parts of this reinsurance program are excess of loss programs and for 2019 2018 and 2017 aggregate stop loss agreements these reinsurance programs are with unaffiliated reinsurance companies most of which are rated “a” or better by am best 

the occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital while sustaining at least two oneinone hundred year events in a single contract period it contains several layers privatelyplaced reinsurance a catastrophe bond and coverage obtained through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund among other arrangements the program includes layers that are purchased for multiyear periods and layers as to which we have prepaid premiums for reinstatement of coverage after the first covered event to ensure coverage for the second event under the current program we are responsible for all losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae that do not reach the reinsurance threshold of 60 million and for the first 60 million in losses and alae from each event that exceeds the threshold we may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum limits of the reinsurance coverage that is then in place coverage limits for a first event in florida would be 18 billion while coverage for a first event outside of florida would be 135 billion coverage for a second event and potentially for subsequent covered events would depend on a number of factors including the severity and location of the earlier events in the contract period we expect that in mid2020 our retention threshold for this program will increase to at least 70 million and that the maximum coverage limits may also be increased subject to our ongoing negotiations with reinsurers 

we have aggregate stoploss reinsurance agreements asl which are in effect for accident years 2019 2018 and 2017 with substantially the same terms the asl agreements for 2017 and 2018 cover accident year property losses and certain alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms and liability claims for business written by arx subsidiaries that write property business as such it provides protection for losses and alae incurred by our property business in the ordinary course including those resulting from other significant severe weather events such as hail tornadoes etc this agreement provides 200 million of coverage to the extent that the net loss and alae ratio for the full accident year exceeds 63 the asl reduced the likelihood that we would experience a net underwriting loss for reasons other than named storms and liability claims the asl agreement for 2019 accident year losses has substantially the same terms as those discussed above for the 2017 and 2018 agreements with the exception that the 2019 asl also covers an additional 100 million of retained losses and alae from named storms 

we did not renew our asl program for 2020 instead we entered into a property catastrophe aggregate excess of loss program in january 2020 this agreement contains two layers each with a retention threshold of 375 million the first layer provides 130 million of coverage for catastrophe losses and alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical 

 5  

storms the second layer provides 60 million of coverage through may 31 2020 and 70 million for the remainder of the year for our retained losses and alae from both named and nonnamed storms the first layer does not have to be exhausted before the second layer can be applied for example if we incurred nonnamed catastrophe losses and alae of 350 million and named storm losses of 50 million we would have no reinsurance coverage under the first layer since the nonnamed catastrophe losses did not exceed the retention threshold however we would recognize a reinsurance recoverable of 25 million under the second layer representing the amount that our total losses of 400 million 350 million of nonnamed and 50 million of named catastrophe losses exceeded the 375 million retention threshold 

for the tnc business written by commercial lines we have quota share reinsurance agreements under which we cede a portion of premium losses and loss adjustment expenses some portion of that reinsurance is with captive reinsurers and a portion is with a panel of thirdparty reinsurers which are rated “a” or better by am best cession rates vary by state with recoverables collateralized at a target of over 100 

claims 

we manage our personal and commercial lines claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 250 standalone claims offices and just over 2500 network shops located throughout the united states for our property business we manage claims adjusting primarily through a network of independent claims field adjusters while internal claims representatives manage the overall claims process we currently employ about 370 internal property claim representatives during 2020 we plan to increase our internal claims staff 

competitive factors 

the insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology to operate our business and on extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies highquality customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is also affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we sustain security breaches or other “cyber attacks” on our systems or are unable to maintain uninterrupted access to our systems business functions and the systems of certain thirdparty providers see item 1a risk factors  for more information 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry some of our competitors have many more patents than we do some of the patents we currently hold include a usagebased insurance patent expiring in 2024 two patents for the system we use for securing esignature transactions expiring in 2025 two us patents on the name your price ® functionality on our website expiring in 2028 two multiproduct quoting patents expiring in 2032 two patents for our implementation of a mobile insurance platform and architecture expiring in 2032 a patent on our system of providing customized insurance quotes based on user’s price andor coverage preferences expiring in 2033 two patents for our loyalty call routing system expiring in 2033 a patent for a multivariate predictive system that processes usagebased data expiring in 2035 and two patents for the implementation of a chatbot in online quoting and servicing expiring in 2038 and 2039 

we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from almost 33 billion driving miles derived from our usagebased devices and our mobile app we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile our insurance subsidiaries mutual insurance company and lloyds company are domiciled in the states of california delaware florida illinois indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws we also have a subsidiary that writes excess and surplus lines these activities do not require a license but are regulated 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance which is the target for our vehicle businesses our property business maintains a lower premiumstosurplus ratio thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2019  we had net premiums written of  376 billion and statutory surplus of 137 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 27 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2019  we had access to 32 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes in january 2020 we used 14 billion of these securities to pay our common share dividends 

 7  

the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is determined by a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2019  our rbc ratios were in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see note 8 – statutory financial information in our annual report for further discussion 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of unfairdiscriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information cybersecurity use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the federal insurance office is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk

investments 

our investment portfolio which had a fair value of 393 billion at december 31 2019  compared to 336 billion at december 31 2018  consists of fixedmaturity securities shortterm investments and equity securities nonredeemable preferred stocks and common equity securities our fixedmaturity securities shortterm investments and nonredeemable preferred stocks are collectively referred to as fixedincome securities our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors for securities held in our investment portfolios total investment income includes interest and dividends net realized gains losses on securities sold net holding period gains losses on securities which for 2019 and 2018 was composed primarily of valuation changes on equity securities and writedowns on securities held in our investment portfolio total investment income before expenses and taxes was 21345 million in 2019 compared to 4833 million in 2018 and 6623 million in 2017 for our investment portfolio on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in net unrealized gains losses investment income was 27281 million 3575 million and 12108 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively outside of our investment portfolio but reported in impairment losses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income were 633 million 683 million and 496 million of otherthantemporary impairment losses resulting from renewable energy tax credit investments during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively for more detailed discussion of our investment portfolio see note 2 – investments note 3 – fair value and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report 

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2019  was 41571 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or ibnr are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors 

these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

see note 6 – loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the annual report for a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices and a reconciliation of our loss and lae reserve activity along with incurred and paid claims development by accident year for our segments based on definitions pursuant to statutory accounting principles

 item 1a risk factors 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold technological advances home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our equity or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time 

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

 11  

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents other insured events and associated losses and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events loss costs expenses and inflation among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 12  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather or other catastrophe events and changing climate conditions may be exacerbating these impacts 

our insurance operating results could be materially adversely affected by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks cyber attacks epidemics pandemics riots and hazardous material releases the frequency severity duration and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur how long they last and how much insured damage they cause and may change where the events occur catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe event is a function of our total insured exposure in the area affected by the event the nature severity and duration of the event and the extent of reinsurance that we have obtained with respect to such an event we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency severity or duration or unanticipated changes in geographic location or scope of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines businesses including the transportation network company business and our umbrella insurance business reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we remain liable under our policies to the insured as the direct insurer on 

 13  

all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute our reinsurance claims further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions which have been and in the future could be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events such as catastrophes we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the unavailability andor cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition 

ii operating risks 

we compete in propertycasualty markets that are highly competitive 

the markets in which we sell insurance are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other companies potentially including existing insurance companies vehicle manufacturing companies other wellfinanced companies seeking new opportunities or new competitors with technological or other innovations also have entered these markets and may continue to do so in the future many of our competitors have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills innovation operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time such as advances in vehicle technology autonomous or semiautonomous vehicles or vehicle sharing arrangements 

we expect similar and perhaps greater competitive pressures with respect to any new insurance or noninsurance businesses that we decide to enter in the future in such cases we would be selling products or services that are new to us while our competitors could include large wellfinanced companies with significant product and marketing experience in such businesses 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again the ability to discern at any point in time whether we are in a “hard” or “soft” market is often difficult as such a conclusion represents an assessment of innumerable data points including among others the operating results of and the dynamic competitive actions taken by us and many competitors in multiple markets involving a variety of products often detailed information on our competitors becomes available on a delayed basis and the nature of the market becomes apparent only in retrospect our ability to predict future competitive conditions is also constrained as a result 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of insurance business in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

 14  

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our businesses these risks include our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems the development of new modes of communication changing insurance shopping trends our understanding of the operations and needs of significant customers and the availability of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies 

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights from time to time has resulted in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

we have made significant investments in our brand over many years and we believe it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to maintain and improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that maintaining and improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by situations that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices adverse financial developments perceptions of our corporate governance or social responsibility the conduct of our officers or employees the actions of a significant customer or other businesses with which we do business including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as consumers and other stakeholders increase their expectations regarding corporate conduct and responsibility these impacts may be further complicated by the fact that their perceptions are formed through rapid and broad interactions using modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control any such event could decrease demand for our products reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees and lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our businesses 

our ability to attract develop and retain talent including employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses and assess potential expansion into new products and business areas our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or develop talented executives managers and employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 15  

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and we must adapt to increases in business due to additions of or expansions with significant customers such as transportation network companies in any such case we must adjust our hiring and training programs and staffing levels appropriately our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

we use thirdparty labor to meet a portion of our staffing needs any significant loss in access to qualified external talent on a costeffective basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information methods of customer communications employment practices and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things an insurer’s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable businesses prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs for us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including potentially material assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

in addition data privacy and security regulations impose complex compliance and reporting requirements and challenges for example california’s new consumer privacy protection legislation became effective in 2020 compliance with this new legislation is challenging as it has required us to modify our current business systems and operations in a short time frame and without the benefit of related regulations which are not required to be issued in final form until six months after the legislation’s effective date other states have enacted or are considering privacy and security legislation or regulations and variations in requirements across the states present ongoing compliance challenges compliance with these laws and regulations will result in increased costs which may be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in certain jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

 16  

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in classcollectiverepresentative actions and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of among other things our subsidiaries’ methods used for evaluating and paying medical or injury claims or benefits including but not limited to certain bodily injury personal injury protection uninsured motoristunderinsured motorist umuim and medical payment claims and for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicaremedicaid beneficiaries other claims handling procedures including but not limited to challenges relating to our network of repair facilities our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles our payment of fees and taxes our subrogation practices and our handling of diminution of value claims our assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies rating practices certain policy marketing sales services implementation and renewal practices and procedures including with respect to accessibility our snapshot program certain relationships with independent insurance agents patent matters and certain employment practices including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices among other matters additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices in addition the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on the risks of pending litigation see note 12  litigation in the annual report 

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

 some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack and although we may review and assess thirdparty vendor cyber security controls our efforts may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of such events thirdparty risks may include among other factors the vendor’s lax security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence 

 17  

contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures our systems are being threatened on a regular basis we have experienced minor incidents in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing future attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions and the operation of various thirdparty systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a thirdparty system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill 

efforts to develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and may create enhanced risks 

we are developing and may develop in the future new insurance products including those that insure risks that we have not previously insured contain new coverages or change coverage terms these new products may not be as profitable as our existing products and may not perform as well as we expect in addition these new products may change our risk exposures and the business systems data and models we use to manage those exposures may be less accurate or less effective than those we use with existing products 

in addition we are evaluating other business models both insurance and noninsurance related and are considering investments in different business areas these activities may take the form of internal development equity investments targeted mergers or acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships these new ventures may require us to make significant expenditures which may negatively impact our results in the near term and if not successful could materially and adversely affect our results of operations while at the onset of the venture we would expect these projects to provide longterm value there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 

as a result of business acquisitions we have recorded goodwill generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and certain intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition and we may record additional goodwill and intangible assets in the future we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting 

 18  

in asset writedowns goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

our common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index although we anticipate that during 2020 we will add exchange traded funds or similar securities designed to track the russell 1000 or the standard  poor’s 500 “sp 500” index our equity investment strategies may not successfully replicate the performance of the indexes that they seek to track our equity investments are also subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio or exchange traded fund that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or sp 500 is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and they are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 and sp 500 indexes are generally considered to be broadly diversified significant portions of each index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained 

 19  

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2019 and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio 

the elimination of or change in the london interbank offered rate libor may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain floating rate securities and other instruments that we hold 

libor is a common benchmark interest rate or reference rate used to set and make adjustments to interest rates for certain floating rate securities and other financial instruments published reports have indicated that regulatory authorities andor financial institutions may change how libor is calculated or discontinue its calculation and publication after 2021 alternative reference rates have been developed including the federal reserve bank of new york’s secured overnight financing rate sofr but the acceptance of such alternative rates and their applicability to existing instruments is uncertain if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason outstanding securities with interest rates tied to libor may be adversely affected if those securities either do not provide for the automatic substitution of another reference rate or convert to another reference rate or a fixed rate that could be less favorable to us outstanding securities and contracts that could be affected include certain preferred stocks and other floating rate securities fixed rate securities that may convert to liborbased floating rate instruments in the future certain derivatives and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to libor any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could also adversely affect the value of those instruments 

iv liquidity risk 

the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed whether due to our own systems difficulties an institutionspecific issue at the bank or financial institution such as a cybersecurity breach a broader disruption in banking financial or wire transfer systems or otherwise our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our business could be materially adversely affected likewise our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

v credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business including under certain government programs become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates 

 20  

pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 in addition under the arx stockholders’ agreement arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and another specified arx stockholder 

the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from paying a dividend on our common shares in certain circumstances 

the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on our common shares while our preferred shares are outstanding unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares including the full dividends for all current dividend periods have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for payment thereof set apart subject to certain exceptions 

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our equity or debt securities could fall significantly 

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

 21  

our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to our common shareholders or no payment in some periods and the dividend policy ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have announced our intention to pay a dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis and to consider paying a variable dividend on at least an annual basis the amount of dividends if any may vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in preceding periods in addition the board retains the discretion to alter our policy or not to pay such dividends at any time such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate the anticipated tax benefits and related returns 

we may invest in certain projects that we believe are entitled to taxadvantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law including renewable energy development historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing and we may make other taxadvantaged investments from time to time our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and in some cases through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project these investments are subject to the risk that the underlying tax credits and related benefits may not be valid and in some cases previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied many of the factors that could lead to the invalidity challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of any dividend that may be paid we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our equity or debt securities our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the payment of dividends and may result in additional volatility in the price of our equity or debt securities

in addition our personal lines business is focused on efforts to form deeper and longerterm relationships with our customers through our destination era strategy in this program we seek to leverage our property business as well as insurance and noninsurance products offered by unaffiliated third parties to provide our customers access to a range of products addressing their diverse needs and if the customer chooses to “bundle” certain of the products together bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda customers who prefer to bundle represent a sizable segment of the insurance market and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs our destination era strategy involves a number of initiatives including

 commercial lines 

the commercial lines segment writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned andor operated predominately by small businesses as a part of the commercial auto market we offer these products in 50 states we do not currently write commercial lines products in the district of columbia this business represented 12 of our total net premiums written in 2018  compared to 11 in both 2017  and 2016  our commercial lines customers on average insure approximately two vehicles even though we continue to write about 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel we are seeing more small business owners purchasing their insurance on a direct basis 

there are approximately 330 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 50 other large companiesgroups each with over 150 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 80 of this market our commercial lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2017 based on premiums written and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2018 

the commercial lines business operates in the following commercial auto business market targets 

 just as in the personal lines business we also want to be the destination for small business owners’ insurance needs to do this we act as an agent for business customers to place general liability and business owners’ policies and workers’ compensation coverage written by unaffiliated insurers we also refer some customers to other unaffiliated providers of such insurance and are compensated for this the products are offered throughout most of the united states during 2018 we also launched businessquote explorer ®  a digital application that allows small business owners to obtain quotes for these products from a select group of unaffiliated partner carriers 

 4  

similar to snapshot in the personal auto business the commercial lines business continues to invest in smart haul ®  a usagebased insurance program for motor carriers smart haul allows owner operators to earn discounts for agreeing to share their electronic logging device eld generated data with us in 2018 we entered into a cooperative marketing agreement with the leading provider of elds to owneroperator and small fleet trucking businesses which we believe will help drive future demand and continue to grow the smart haul program smart haul is currently available in 46 states 

at december 31 2018 we provided commercial auto and claims service to an uber technologies subsidiary in four states and expect to expand into additional markets in 2019 

property 

we began reporting property as a segment in 2015 after we acquired a majority interest in arx property business written prior to 2015 was negligible 

as one of the 15 largest homeowners carriers in the united states we specialize in property insurance for homes condos manufactured homes and renters as well as personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 380 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide and we compete with a predominance of these companies the top 15 carriers comprise about 70 of the market 

our property segment writes residential property insurance in 43 states and the district of columbia and renters insurance in 44 states and the district of columbia primarily in the independent agency channel we also act as a participant in the “write your own” program for the national flood insurance program under which we write flood insurance in 44 states and the district of columbia 

our property business represented about 5 of our total net premiums written in 2018  compared to 4 in both 2017  and 2016  we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters based on the cyclical nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent for 2018  texas and florida comprised 46 of our property business based on direct premiums written as a property writer we have exposure to losses from catastrophes including hurricanes and other severe storms to help mitigate these risks we enter into reinsurance arrangements see the “reinsurance” section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs 

as discussed above our property business is an important component of our destination era strategy 

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses 

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 in our direct business we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by us as well as unaffiliated insurance companies in the continental united states we receive commissions for policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

in our commercial lines business we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies this program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout most of the united states and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of december 31 2018  we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

 5  

reinsurance 

we cede a portion of our direct premiums written to reinsurance plans we participate in several mandatory state pools including the michigan catastrophic claims association florida hurricane catastrophe fund and north carolina reinsurance facility we also act as servicing agent for statemandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles caip plans and as a participant in the “write your own” program for federally regulated plans for flood national flood insurance program all of these programs are governed by insurance regulations 

we also have voluntary contractual arrangements that primarily relate to our transportation network company business written by our commercial lines segment and the property business the reinsurance program in our property business is designed to reduce overall risk while to the extent of coverage purchased protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophes and severe storms the largest parts of this reinsurance program are an occurrence excess of loss program and aggregate stoploss agreements from unaffiliated reinsurance companies most of which are rated “a” or better by am best 

the occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital while sustaining at least two oneinone hundred year events in a single contract period it contains several layers privatelyplaced reinsurance a catastrophe bond and coverage obtained through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund among other arrangements the program includes layers that are purchased for multiyear periods and layers as to which we have prepaid premiums for reinstatement of coverage after the first covered event to ensure coverage for the second event we are responsible for all losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae that do not reach the reinsurance threshold of 60 million and for the first 60 million in losses and alae from each of the first and second events in the same contract period that exceed the threshold under certain circumstances and if coverage has not been exhausted by the first two events the reinsurance threshold for a third event may be reduced to 25 million we may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum limits of the reinsurance coverage that is then in place coverage limits for a first event in florida would be 16 billion while coverage for a first event outside of florida would be 12 billion coverage for a second event and potentially for subsequent covered events would depend on a number of factors including the severity and location of the earlier events in the contract period 

we also have aggregate stoploss reinsurance agreements asl which were in effect during 2017 and 2018 with substantially the same terms these asl agreements cover property losses and alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms and liability claims for business written by arx subsidiaries that write property business as such it provides protection for losses and alae incurred by our property business in the ordinary course including those resulting from other significant severe weather events such as hail tornadoes etc this agreement provides 200 million of coverage to the extent that the net loss and lae ratio for the full accident year exceeds 63 the asl reduces the likelihood that we will experience a net underwriting loss for reasons other than named storms and liability claims in 2019 we renewed the asl agreement under substantially the same terms as the prior agreements with the exception that the 2019 asl agreement also covers an additional 100 million of retained losses and alae from named storms 

see note 7 –  reinsurance  in our annual report for further discussion 

claims 

we manage our vehicle claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 260 standalone claims offices and nearly 3000 network shops located throughout the united states during 2018 we ceased using our service center model as part of our claims processing and transitioned to an expanded network shop model with the goal of improving our operating efficiency without any loss to claims accuracy or customer service 

for our property business we handle property claims separately through a network of primarily independent claims adjusters 

competitive factors 

the insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

 6  

we rely heavily on technology to operate our business and on extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies highquality customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we sustain security breaches or other “cyber attacks” on our systems or are unable to maintain uninterrupted access to our systems business functions and the systems of certain thirdparty providers see item 1a risk factors  for more information 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry some of our competitors have many more patents than we do some of the patents we currently hold include two patents related to our online policy selfservice technology expiring mid2019 a usagebased insurance patent expiring in 2024 two patents for the system we use for securing our esignature transactions expiring in 2025 two us patents on the name your price ®  functionality on our website expiring in 2028 two multiproduct quoting patents expiring in 2032 a patent for our implementation of a mobile insurance platform and architecture expiring in 2032 a patent on our system of providing customized insurance quotes based on user’s price andor coverage preferences expiring in 2033 two patents for our loyalty call routing system expiring in 2033 and a patent for the implementation of a chatbot in online quoting and buying expiring in 2038 

we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 27 billion driving miles derived from our usagebased devices and our mobile app we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile our insurance subsidiaries mutual insurance company and lloyds company are domiciled in the states of california delaware florida illinois indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 



 7  

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance which is the target for our vehicle businesses our property business maintains a lower premiumstosurplus ratio thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2018  we had net premiums written of  326 billion  and statutory surplus of 117 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 28 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2018  we had access to 29 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes in february 2019 we used 15 billion of these securities to pay our common share dividends 

the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is determined by a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2018  our rbc ratios were in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see note 8 –  statutory financial information in our annual report for further discussion 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

 8  

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information cybersecurity use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the federal insurance office is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk

investments 

our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 336 billion  at december 31 2018  compared to 273 billion  at december 31 2017

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2018  was 37346 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or ibnr are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors 

these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

see note 6 – loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the annual report for a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices and a reconciliation of our loss and lae reserve activity along with incurred and paid claims development by accident year for our segments based on definitions pursuant to statutory accounting principles

 item 1a risk factors 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold technological advances home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time 

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

 12  

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents other insured events and associated losses and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events loss costs expenses and inflation among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 13  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the frequency severity duration and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur how long they last and how much insured damage they cause and may change where the events occur catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature severity and duration of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency severity or duration or unanticipated changes in geographic location or scope of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the 

 14  

original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute reinsurance claims further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events such as catastrophes we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the unavailability andor cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition 

ii operating risks 

we compete in propertycasualty markets that are highly competitive 

the markets in which we sell insurance are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other companies potentially including existing insurance companies other wellfinanced companies seeking new opportunities or new competitors with technological or other innovations also may enter these markets in the future many of our competitors have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills innovation operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

 15  

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business these risks include our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems the development of new modes of communication changing insurance shopping trends and the availability of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies 

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices the conduct of our officers or employees the actions of businesses with which we do business including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talent including employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses and assess potential expansion into new products and business areas our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or develop talented employees executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and staffing levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

 we use thirdparty labor to meet a portion of our staffing needs any significant loss in access to qualified external talent on a costeffective basis could have an adverse effect on our business 

 16  

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information methods of customer communications and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things an insurer’s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs for us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including potentially material assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

in addition data privacy and security regulations impose complex compliance and reporting requirements and challenges for example california recently enacted consumer privacy protection legislation that will become effective in 2020 compliance with this new legislation will be challenging as it will require us to modify our current business systems and operations in a short time frame and without the benefit of related regulations which are not required to be issued until six months after the legislation’s effective date other states are considering privacy and security legislation and variations in requirements across the states present ongoing compliance challenges compliance with these laws and regulations may result in increased costs which may be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in certain jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims or for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicaremedicaid beneficiaries other claims handling procedures including challenges relating to our network of repair facilities our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles 

 17  

for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles our payment of fees and taxes our subrogation practices and our handling of diminution of value claims our assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies rating practices certain policy sales services implementation and renewal practices and procedures including with respect to accessibility our snapshot program certain relationships with independent insurance agents and certain employment practices including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices among other mattersadditional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on the risks of pending litigation see note 12  litigation  in the annual report 

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

 some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack thirdparty risks may include among other factors the vendor’s lax security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures our systems are being threatened on a regular basis we have experienced minor incidents in the past and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing future attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

 18  

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions and the operation of various thirdparty systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a thirdparty system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill 

efforts to develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and may create enhanced risks 

we are developing and may develop in the future new insurance products including those that insure risks that we have not previously insured contain new coverages or change coverage terms these new products may not be as profitable as our existing products and may not perform as well as we expect in addition these new products may change our risk exposures and the business systems data and models we use to manage those exposures may be less accurate or less effective than those we use with existing products 

in addition we are evaluating other business models both insurance and noninsurance related and are considering investments in different business areas these activities may take the form of internal development equity investments targeted mergers or acquisitions joint ventures or strategic partnerships these new ventures may require us to make significant expenditures which may negatively impact our results in the near term and if not successful could materially and adversely affect our results of operations while at the onset of the venture we would expect these projects to provide longterm value there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 

as a result of business acquisitions we have recorded goodwill generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and certain intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition and we may record additional goodwill and intangible assets in the future we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting in writedowns of the assets goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses 

 19  

our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2017 and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio 

iv liquidity risk 

the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed whether due to our own systems difficulties an institutionspecific issue at the bank or financial institution such as a cybersecurity breach a broader disruption in banking financial or wire transfer systems or otherwise our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our 

 20  

business could be materially adversely affected likewise our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

v credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business including under certain government programs become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 in addition under the arx stockholders’ agreement arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and another specified arx stockholder 

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

 21  

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to shareholders or no payment in some periods and the dividend policy ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on a quarterly basis and to consider paying a variable dividend on at least an annual basis the amount of dividends if any may vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in preceding periods in addition the board retains the discretion to alter our policy or not to pay dividends at any time such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate the anticipated returns 

we may invest in certain projects that are entitled to taxadvantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law including renewable energy development historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing and we may make other taxadvantaged investments from time to time our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and in some cases through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of any dividend that may be paid we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the payment of dividends and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

 item 1 business 

a general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has insurance and noninsurance subsidiaries and affiliates our insurance subsidiaries and affiliates provide personal and commercial auto insurance residential property insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services our vehicle insurance products protect our customers against losses due to physical damage to their motor vehicles uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our residential property insurance products protect our customers against losses due to damages to their structure or possessions within the structure as well as liability for accidents occurring in the structure or on the property our noninsurance subsidiaries and affiliates generally support our insurance and investment operations we operate our vehicle businesses throughout the united states and our property business in most us jurisdictions in 2017 we ceased writing and servicing personal auto physical damage and auto property damage liability insurance in australia 

the progressive corporation acquired a controlling interest in arx holding corp “arx” the parent company of american strategic insurance and other insurance subsidiaries and affiliates “asi” in april 2015 and we now write residential property insurance for homeowners other property owners and renters as a result of this acquisition we began reporting the property business as a separate segment as of the acquisition date 

the progressive corporation and the other arx stockholders and stock option holders are parties to a stockholders’ agreement which addresses the parties’ respective rights and obligations among other provisions the stockholders’ agreement allows and in certain circumstances requires the progressive corporation to acquire 100 of the outstanding equity of arx by the second quarter of 2021 these provisions are described in note 15 –  redeemable noncontrolling interest  to our financial statements included in our 2017 annual report to shareholders which is filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the “annual report” until the progressive corporation  owns 100 of the outstanding equity of arx the interests of the minority stockholders in arx’s income and assets are reflected in our financial statements as noncontrolling interest 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10 –  segment information  in our annual report 

c narrative description of business 

we had net premiums written of  271 billion  in 2017  compared to  234 billion  in 2016  and  206 billion  in 2015  our combined ratio which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less fees and other revenues by our net premiums earned was 934  in 2017  951  in 2016  and 925  in 2015  

organization 

our operations are run by our executive team which consists of our chief executive officer and the heads of our major business areas that report to the ceo including a chief financial officer chief investment officer chief legal officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer along with the presidents of personal lines commercial lines claims and customer relationship management our property business is currently headed by the president and chief executive officer of arx who reports to the arx board of directors progressive appoints three of the five members of the arx board 

our insurance and claims organizations are generally managed on a statebystate basis due to the nature of insurance legal and regulatory requirements and other local factors and are supplemented by national operations and supported by our corporate functions statespecific organizations typically report to a regional general manager who then reports to the applicable group president in california we operate separate agency auto organizations with their own management and organizations under the drive and asi brands 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles which we refer to as our special lines products this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group as of december 31 2017 we wrote personal auto insurance in all 50 states and the district of columbia and we write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states the personal lines business accounted for 85 of total net premiums written in 2017 and 2016 and 86 in 2015 

 2  

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 our personal lines strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a broad range of personal auto and special lines insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers and combined with property insurance and other products when appropriate to match our customers’ needs volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition quality service and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” below for further discussion 

we seek to refine our personal auto segmentation underwriting models and pricing over time during 2017 we continued to roll out our next generation auto product which began in mid2016 this product version expands our use of prior claims information adds billing and vehicle history segmentation and expands our tiering mechanisms to afford more competitive rates for new business while providing more stable rates for our longertenured customers 

we also continue to invest to bring snapshot ®  our usagebased insurance program to more customers snapshot provides customers in both the agency and direct channels the opportunity to improve their auto insurance rates based on their personal driving behavior we offer snapshot through our traditional hardwarebased version which is available nationwide except for california and north carolina due to the regulatory environment as well as through our mobileapp version which is available in 42 states and the district of columbia this mobile app improves the user experience while also reducing monitoring costs in addition to the personal benefits for our customers the data collected via the mobile app affords us a unique perspective on mobile device usage vehicle operations and accidents 

in addition our personal lines business is focused on efforts to form deeper and longerterm relationships with our customers through our destination era strategy in this program we seek to leverage our property business as well as insurance and noninsurance products offered by unaffiliated third parties to provide our customers access to a range of products addressing their diverse needs and if the customer chooses to “bundle” certain of the products together bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda customers who prefer to bundle represent a sizable segment of the insurance market and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs our destination era strategy involves a number of initiatives including

 commercial lines 

the commercial lines segment writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned andor operated predominately by small businesses as a part of the commercial auto market we offer these products in 50 states we do not currently write commercial lines products in the district of columbia this business represented 11 of our total net premiums written in 2017 2016 and 2015 our commercial lines customers on average insure approximately two vehicles even though we continue to write over 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel we are seeing more small business owners purchasing their insurance on a direct basis 

there are approximately 335 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 43 other large companiesgroups each with over 150 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 80 of this market our commercial lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2016 based on net premiums written and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2017 

the commercial lines business operates in the following business market targets 

 just as in the personal lines business we also want to be the destination for small business owners’ insurance needs to do this we act as an agent for business customers to place general liability and business owners’ policies and workers’ compensation coverage written by unaffiliated insurers we also refer some customers to other unaffiliated providers of such insurance and are compensated for this the products are generally offered throughout the continental united states 

similar to snapshot in the personal auto business during 2017 the commercial lines business launched smarthaul a usagebased insurance program for motor carriers smarthaul allows owner operators to earn discounts up to 18 for agreeing to share their electronic logging device eld generated data with progressive smarthaul is available in 41 states and we expect that demand for this program will continue to grow 

 4  

we provide commercial auto and claims service to an uber technologies subsidiary in texas we are learning alongside a leading technology platform in the sharing economy we expect to expand into additional markets in 2018 

property 

asi one of the 20 largest homeowners carriers in the united states specializes in residential property insurance personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 385 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide the top 20 carriers comprise about 75 of the market 

our property segment writes homeowners and renters insurance primarily in the agency channel in 41 states and the district of columbia asi also acts as a participant in the “write your own” program for the national flood insurance program under which they write flood insurance in 43 states and the district of columbia property policies are written on a 12month basis 

our property business represented about 4 of our total net premiums written in 2017 and 2016 compared to 3 in 2015 we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters based on the cyclical nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent for 2017 texas and florida comprised 54 of our property business based on direct premiums written as a property writer asi has exposure to losses from catastrophes including hurricanes and other severe storms to help mitigate these risks asi enters into reinsurance arrangements see the “reinsurance” section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs 

as discussed above asi’s property business is an important component of our destination era strategy during 2017 we began to transition asi’s products to the progressive brand we expect that this branding will make it easier to sell the progressivebranded auto and home bundle 

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability business we did not have any professional liability policies in force as of december 31 2017 although we continue to process claims on expired policies 

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 in our direct business we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by unaffiliated insurance companies on a nationwide basis we receive commissions for policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

in our commercial lines business we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies this program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout the continental united states and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of december 31 2017 we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

reinsurance 

we cede a portion of our direct premiums written to reinsurance plans we participate in several mandatory state pools including the michigan catastrophic claims association florida hurricane catastrophe fund and north carolina reinsurance facility as well as act as a servicing agent for statemandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles caip plans and as a participant in the “write your own” program for federally regulated plans for flood national flood insurance program all of which are governed by insurance regulations we also have voluntary contractual arrangements that primarily relate to the 

 5  

property business underwritten by insurance subsidiaries of arx and our transportation network company business written by our commercial lines segment 

the reinsurance program in our property business is designed to reduce overall risk while to an extent protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophes and severe storms this reinsurance program has two parts an occurrence excess of loss program and an aggregate stoploss agreement from unaffiliated reinsurance companies most of which are “a” rated or better by am best 

the occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital within arx’s insurance subsidiaries while sustaining at least two oneinone hundred year events in a single contract period it contains several layers privatelyplaced reinsurance a catastrophe bond and coverage obtained through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund among other arrangements the program includes layers that are purchased for multiyear periods and layers as to which we have prepaid premiums for reinstatement of coverage after the first covered event to ensure coverage for the second event arx is responsible for all losses and loss adjustment expenses lae that do not reach the reinsurance threshold of 50 million and for the first 50 million in losses and lae from each of the first and second events in the same contract period that exceed the threshold under certain circumstances and if coverage has not been exhausted by the first two events the reinsurance threshold for a third event may be reduced to 25 million asi may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum limits of the reinsurance coverage that is then in place coverage limits for a first event in florida would exceed 15 billion while coverage for a first event outside of florida would exceed 10 billion coverage for a second named storm and potentially for subsequent covered events would depend on a number of factors including the severity and location of the earlier events in the contract period 

arx also has an aggregate stoploss reinsurance agreement asl which was in effect during 2017 and renewed under substantially the same terms for 2018 the asl covers all property losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms and liability claims as such it provides protection for losses and alae incurred by our property business in the ordinary course including those resulting from other significant severe weather events such as hail tornadoes etc this agreement provides 200 million of coverage to the extent that arx’s insurance subsidiaries’ net loss and lae ratio for the full accident year exceeds 63 the asl reduces the likelihood that arx will experience a net underwriting loss for reasons other than named storms and liability claims 

see note 7 –  reinsurance  in our annual report for further discussion 

claims 

we manage our vehicle claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 200 standalone claims offices 68 service centers and nearly 3000 network shops located throughout the united states we are transitioning how we will use our service centers as part of our claims processing the service center model has been part of our claims operating model for almost two decades over that time the model has evolved in response to shifting customer preferences and fastpaced environmental change the most recent of which is customer photo estimating under the revised claims operating model we will rely less on the service center model and more on an expanded network shop model with the goal of improving our operating efficiency without any loss to claims accuracy or customer service 

for our property business asi handles property claims separately through a network primarily of independent claims adjusters 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

 6  

we rely heavily on technology to operate our business and on extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies highquality customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we sustain security breaches or other “cyber attacks” on our systems or are unable to maintain uninterrupted access to our systems business functions and the systems of certain thirdparty providers see item 1a risk factors  for more information 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry some of our competitors have many more patents than we do we hold a us patent expiring in 2021 and have a us patent application pending on the innovative approach to vehicle repair service used in our service centers as described above and two us patents expiring in 2028 on the name your price ®  functionality on our website in addition we hold two patents expiring in 2019 related to our online policy selfservice technology a new usagebased insurance patent expiring in 2024 a new multiproduct quoting patent expiring in 2032 two patents for the system we use for securing our esignature transactions expiring in 2025 and two patents for our loyalty call routing system expiring in 2033 

we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 22 billion driving miles derived from usagebased devices we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile our insurance subsidiaries and our mutual insurance company and our lloyds company together our mutual insurance company affiliates are domiciled in the states of california delaware florida illinois indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 



 7  

insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance which is the target for our vehicle businesses our property business maintains a lower premiumstosurplus ratio thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2017  we had net premiums written of  271 billion  and statutory surplus of 97 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 28 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2017  we had access to 16 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes 

the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is determined by a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2017 our rbc ratios were in excess of minimum requirements with one exception one subsidiary of arx triggered a company action level event under the rbc program as a result of its combined ratio for 2017 exceeding the maximum amount allowed under a specific rbc test due to the significant amount of hurricane losses incurred on this subsidiary during the year in response to this event concurrent with the filing of their annual statement the insurance company will submit to the florida insurance commissioner an rbc plan outlining the corrective actions the subsidiary has taken ie contributed capital and intends to take in an effort that would be expected to result in the elimination of the event t his matter is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c  below for further information on these dividend limitations the scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the naic in 2010 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

 8  

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information cybersecurity use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary since 2010 the federal insurance office has been required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk

investments 

our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 273 billion  at december 31 2017  compared to 235 billion  at december 31 2016  investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors for securities held in our investment portfolios the total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 6623 million in 2017  compared to 5897 million in 2016  and 5673 million in 2015  for our investment portfolio on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in unrealized gainslosses investment income was 12108 million 7910 million and 2429 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively outside of our investment portfolio during 2017 and 2016 we recognized a 496 million and 597 million respectively of otherthantemporary impairment loss resulting from renewable energy tax credit investments entered into during the years for more detailed discussion of our investment portfolio see note 2 – investments note 3 – fair value and  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the annual report 

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2017  was 33656 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation including 806 employees employed by arx and its subsidiaries and affiliates 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors 

these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

see note 6 – loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the annual report for a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices and a reconciliation of our loss and lae reserve activity along with incurred and paid claims development by accident year for our segments based on definitions pursuant to statutory accounting principles in addition further information about our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on august 12 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time 

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

 12  

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents other insured events and associated losses and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events loss costs expenses and inflation among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 13  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion of this report 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the frequency and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute reinsurance claims further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events such as catastrophes we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the unavailability andor cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition

ii operating risks 

we compete in propertycasualty markets that are highly competitive 

we write insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles homeowners and renters and commercial autos and trucks for small businesses all of these markets are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other companies potentially including existing insurance companies other wellfinanced companies seeking new opportunities or new competitors with technological or other innovations also may enter these markets in the future many of our competitors have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business these risks include our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems the development of new modes of communication changing insurance shopping trends and the availability of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies 

 15  

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices the conduct of our officers or employees the actions of businesses with which we do business including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or develop talented employees executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

 16  

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information privacy and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things an insurer’s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs for us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion of this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims or for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicaremedicaid beneficiaries other claims handling procedures including challenges relating to our network of repair facilities our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles our subrogation practices and our handling of diminution of value claims assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies policy sales implementation and renewal practices and procedures and employmentrelated litigation including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices among other matters additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

 17  

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on the risks of pending litigation see note 12 – litigation  in the annual report 

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

 some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack thirdparty risks may include among other factors the vendor’s lax security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures our systems are being threatened on a regular basis and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

 18  

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions and the operation of various thirdparty systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a thirdparty system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill 

we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 

as a result of business acquisitions we have recorded goodwill generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and certain intangible assets at fair value at the time of acquisition we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting in writedowns of the assets goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses 

our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

 19  

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2017 and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio 

iv liquidity risk 

the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed whether due to our own systems difficulties an institutionspecific issue at the bank or financial institution such as a cybersecurity breach a broader disruption in banking financial or wire transfer systems or otherwise our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our business could be adversely affected likewise our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

v credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business under certain government programs become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

 20  

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 in addition under the arx stockholders’ agreement arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and other specified arx stockholders further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c  “dividends” of this report 

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

our annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2017 and 2018 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our gainsharing annual cash incentive plans for most of our employees and based on the operating performance of our insurance businesses if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes the change in unrealized investment gains and losses among other items is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

 21  

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2018 to be paid early in 2019 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2018 or early 2019 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2018 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate the anticipated returns 

we may invest in certain projects that are entitled to taxadvantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law including renewable energy development historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing and we may make other taxadvantaged investments from time to time our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and in some cases through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

the closing price of our common shares on january 31 2018  was 5410 

b holders 

we had 2082 shareholders of record on december 31 2017  

c dividends 

we maintain a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year this annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of aftertax underwriting income multiplied by a performance factor “gainshare factor” which beginning in 2017 is determined by reference to the agency auto direct auto special lines commercial lines and property business units with minor exclusions and adjustments and subject to the limitations discussed below the target percentage is determined by our board of directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public in december 2016  the board determined the target percentage for 2017  to be 3313 of annual aftertax underwriting income which is unchanged from the target percentage in both 2016  and 2015  in december 2017 the board also determined this target will remain at 3313 for 2018  since the inception of our variable dividend we have applied a tax rate of 35 to calculate the aftertax underwriting income beginning in 2018 we will apply a rate of 21 to calculate the aftertax underwriting income 

the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the specified business units for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives as approved by the compensation committee of the board this gainshare factor is also used in the annual cash incentive program currently in place for our employees our “gainsharing program” if the gainshare factor is zero or if our comprehensive income is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend would be payable under our annual variable dividend policy 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual variable dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual variable dividend for 2018  or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares

consolidated statutory surplus was 97 billion  on december 31 2017  and 86 billion on december 31 2016  at december 31 2017  8301 million  of consolidated statutory surplus represented net admitted assets of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile the companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements generally the net admitted assets of insurance companies that subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed dividends from other funds may also be limited by regulation or subject to prior approval by regulators in certain states based on the dividend laws currently in effect the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of 13905 million  in 2018  without prior approval from regulatory authorities provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary

the progressive corporation acquired a controlling interest in arx holding corp “arx” the parent company of american strategic insurance and other insurance subsidiaries and affiliates “asi” in april 2015 and we now write residential property insurance for homeowners other property owners and renters as a result of this acquisition we began reporting the property business as a separate segment as of the acquisition date 

the progressive corporation and the other arx stockholders and stock option holders are parties to a stockholders’ agreement which addresses the parties’ respective rights and obligations among other provisions the stockholders’ agreement allows and in certain circumstances requires the progressive corporation to acquire 100 of the outstanding equity of arx by the end of 2021 these provisions are described in note 15 –  redeemable noncontrolling interest  to our financial statements included in our 2016 annual report to shareholders which is filed as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the “annual report” until the progressive corporation  owns 100 of the outstanding equity of arx the interests of the minority stockholders in arx’s income and assets are reflected in our financial statements as noncontrolling interest 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10 –  segment information  in our annual report 

c narrative description of business 

we had net premiums written of  234 billion  in 2016  compared to  206 billion  in 2015  and  187 billion  in 2014  our combined ratio which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less fees and other revenues by our net premiums earned was 951  in 2016  925  in 2015  and 923  in 2014  

organization 

our operations are run by our executive team which consists of our chief executive officer and the heads of our major business areas that report to the ceo including a chief financial officer chief investment officer chief legal officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer along with the presidents of personal lines commercial lines claims and customer relationships our property business is headed by the president and chief executive officer of arx who reports to the arx board of directors progressive appoints three of the five members of the arx board 

our insurance and claims organizations are generally managed on a statebystate basis due to the nature of insurance legal and regulatory requirements and other local factors and are supplemented by national operations and supported by our corporate functions statespecific organizations typically report to a regional general manager who then reports to the applicable group president separate managers and organizations are responsible for our california agency and australian operations 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles which we refer to as our special lines products this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group as of december 31 2016 we wrote personal auto insurance in all 50 states and the district of columbia and we write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states we also write 

 2  

personal auto insurance in australia the personal lines business accounted for 85 of total net premiums written in 2016 86 in 2015 and 90 in 2014 

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 

our personal lines strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a broad range of personal auto and special lines insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers and combined with property insurance and other products when appropriate to match our customers’ needs volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition quality service and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” below for further discussion 

we seek to refine our personal auto segmentation underwriting models and pricing over time in mid2016 we introduced our next generation auto product and will continue to roll this product out during 2017 this product version expands our use of prior claims information adds billing and vehicle history segmentation and expands our tiering mechanisms to afford more competitive rates for new business while providing more stable rates for our longertenured customers 

we also continue to invest to bring snapshot ®  our usagebased insurance program to more customers snapshot provides customers in both the agency and direct channels the opportunity to improve their auto insurance rates based on their personal driving behavior during 2016 we launched the snapshot mobile app which supplements the current device that customers plug into their cars this new app improves the user experience while also reducing monitoring costs snapshot is currently available to our auto customers nationwide except in california and north carolina due to the regulatory environment 

in addition our personal lines business is focused on efforts to form deeper and longerterm relationships with our customers in a strategy we call the destination era in this program we seek to leverage our property business and products offered by unaffiliated third parties to offer our customers access to a range of products addressing their diverse insurance needs and if the customer chooses to “bundle” multiple products together bundled products are becoming an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda customers who prefer to bundle represent a sizable segment of the 

 3  

market and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs our destination era strategy involves a number of initiatives including 

 

commercial lines 

the commercial lines segment writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned andor operated predominately by small businesses as a part of the commercial auto market we offer these products in 49 states we do not currently write commercial lines products in hawaii or the district of columbia this business represented 11 of our total net premiums written in 2016 and 2015 and 10 in 2014 our commercial lines customers on average insure approximately two vehicles even though we continue to write over 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel we are seeing more small business owners purchasing their insurance on a direct basis for 2016 net premiums written through the direct channel increased by 14 

the commercial lines business operates in the following business market targets 

 just as in the personal auto business we also want to be the destination insurer for small business owners through our progressive advantage ® program we offer our commercial auto customers general liability and business owners policies and workers compensation coverage written by unaffiliated insurance companies or agencies the products are generally offered throughout the continental united states 

during 2016 we provided commercial auto and claims service to an uber technologies subsidiary on a pilot basis in texas we are learning alongside a leading technology platform in the sharing economy while simultaneously creating new auto insurance opportunities with ridesharing and other vehicle matching service models we will continue to evaluate this relationship before we expand to other states 

there are approximately 325 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 45 other large companiesgroups each with about 150 million or more of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 80 of this market our commercial lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2015 based on net premiums written and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2016 

 4  

property 

asi one of the 20 largest homeowners carriers in the united states specializes in residential property insurance personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 375 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide the top 20 carriers comprise about 75 of the market 

our property segment writes homeowners and renters insurance primarily in the agency channel in 38 states and the district of columbia asi also acts as a participant in the write your own program for the national flood insurance program under which they write flood insurance in 40 states and the district of columbia property policies are generally written on a 12month basis as discussed above asis property business is an important component of our destination era strategy 

our property business represented about 4 of our total net premiums written in 2016 and 3 in 2015 we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters based on the cyclical nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent for 2016 texas and florida comprised 56 of our property business based on direct premiums written 

asi has exposure to losses from catastrophes and other severe storms to help mitigate these risks asi enters into reinsurance arrangements see the reinsurance section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs 

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability business we had only three professional liability policies in force as of december 31 2016 although we continue to process claims on expired policies 

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 in our direct business we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by unaffiliated insurance companies on a nationwide basis we receive commissions for policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

in our commercial lines business we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies this program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout the continental united states and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of december 31 2016 we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

reinsurance 

we cede a portion of our direct premiums written to reinsurance plans we participate in several mandatory state pools including the michigan catastrophic claims association florida hurricane catastrophe fund and north carolina reinsurance facility as well as act as a servicing agent for statemandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles caip plans and as a participant in the write your own program for federally regulated plans for flood national flood insurance program all of which are governed by insurance regulations we also have voluntary contractual arrangements that primarily relate to the property business underwritten by insurance subsidiaries of arx 

the reinsurance program in our property business is designed to reduce overall risk while to an extent protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophes this reinsurance program has two parts an occurrence excess of loss program and an aggregate stoploss agreement generally from unaffiliated reinsurance companies most of which are a rated by am best the occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital within arx’s insurance subsidiaries 

 5  

while sustaining at least two oneinone hundred year events in a single contract period it contains several layers privatelyplaced reinsurance a catastrophe bond and coverage obtained through the florida hurricane catastrophe fund among other arrangements arx is responsible for all losses where the losses and loss adjustment expenses lae do not reach the reinsurance threshold of 50 million and for the first 50 million in loss and lae from each of the first and second events in the same contract period that exceed the threshold asi may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum limits of the reinsurance coverage 

arx also entered into an aggregate stoploss agreement effective january 1 2017 that covers all losses except those from named storms both hurricanes and tropical storms and liability claims this agreement provides 200 million of coverage if arx’s insurance subsidiaries net loss and lae ratio for the full year exceeds 63 the aggregate stoploss agreement reduces the likelihood that arx will experience a net underwriting loss in 2017 for reasons other than named storms 

see note 7 –  reinsurance  in our annual report for further discussion 

claims 

we manage our vehicle claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 200 standalone claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we operate 68 service centers in 51 metropolitan areas across the country of which 55 have combined claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency and manage costs insureds and other claimants can elect to have their vehicles repaired by repair shops of their choosing have their vehicles repaired by one of our network shops or have the entire repair process coordinated by representatives in one of our service centers if a customer elects to repair their vehicle through a service center we provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete this innovative patented approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to our other claims settlement processes under the service center and network shop options we guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car if a customer decides not to repair their vehicle our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot asi handles property claims separately through a network primarily of independent claims adjusters 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies highquality customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry some of our competitors have many more patents than we do we hold a us patent expiring in 2021 and have a us patent application pending on the innovative approach to vehicle repair service used in our service centers as described above and two us patents expiring in 2028 on the name your price ®  functionality on our website in addition we hold two patents expiring in 2019 related to our online policy selfservice technology 

we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 18 billion driving miles derived from usagebased devices we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile our insurance subsidiaries and our mutual insurance company and lloyds together our mutual insurance company affiliates are domiciled in the states of delaware florida indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance which is the target for our vehicle businesses our property business maintains a lower premiumstosurplus ratio thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2016  we had net premiums written of  234 billion  and statutory surplus of 86 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 27 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2016  we had access to 13 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2016  our rbc ratios were well in excess of minimum requirements 

 7  

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c below for further information on these dividend limitations the scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the naic in 2010 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information cybersecurity use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary since 2010 the federal insurance office has been required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in addition to our us operations we write personal auto physical damage and auto property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is primarily offered through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission which regulates consumer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority which regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdictions issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing

investments 

our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 235 billion  at december 31 2016  compared to 209 billion  at december 31 2015  investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors for securities held in our investment portfolios the total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 5897 million in 2016  compared to 5673 million in 2015  and 6326 million in 2014  for our investment portfolio on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in unrealized gainslosses investment income was 7910 million 2429 million and 7479 million for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively outside of our investment portfolio we recognized a 597 million otherthantemporary impairment loss resulting from two renewable energy tax credit investments entered into during 2016 for more detailed discussion see

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2016  was 31721 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation including 692 employees employed by arx and its subsidiaries and affiliates 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors 

these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

see note 6 – loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in the annual report for a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices and a reconciliation of our loss and lae reserve activity along with incurred and paid claims development by accident year for our segments based on statutory definition in addition further information about our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on august 12 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time 

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

 11  

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents other insured events and associated losses and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events loss costs expenses and inflation among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 12  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the frequency and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our homeowners and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

like many homeowners insurance companies our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute reinsurance claims further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the availability and cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition 

 13  

ii operating risks 

we compete in propertycasualty markets that are highly competitive 

we write insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles commercial autos and trucks for small businesses homeowners and renters all of these markets are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of our competitors have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and efficiently the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business these risks include our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems the development of new modes of communication changing insurance shopping trends and the availability of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices the conduct of our officers or employees the actions of businesses with which we do business including unaffiliated insurers through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners insurance or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or develop talented employees executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

 15  

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information privacy and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances and dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion included in this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations additional litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims or for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicare beneficiaries other claims handling procedures challenges relating to our network of repair facilities or our service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies policy implementation and renewal procedures and employmentrelated litigation including federal wage and hour claims among other matters additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on the risks of pending litigation see note 12 – litigation  in the annual report 

 16  

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

 some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack thirdparty risks may include among other factors the vendor’s lax security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyberattack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

 17  

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a thirdparty system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill 

the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company and our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired 

the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to us or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated in addition as we identify opportunities for integration of arx’s products employees operations or systems with our own we may be unable to execute on such opportunities and generate the benefits identified the costs of those efforts may be greater than expected or those efforts may cause difficulties or unintended consequences that could adversely impact our operations and results 

 at the time of the arx acquisition we recorded goodwill and intangible assets at fair value we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting in writedowns of the assets goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses 

our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors 

 18  

there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we hold credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or our ability to liquidate investments when desired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations in addition if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2016 and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio 

iv credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 



 19  

 in addition under the arx stockholders’ agreement arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and other specified arx stockholders further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

our annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2016 and 2017 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our gainsharing cash bonus plans for most of our employees and based on the operating performance of our vehicle insurance businesses for 2016 and our vehicle and our property businesses with minor exclusions for 2017 if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes the change in unrealized investment gains and losses among other items is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2017 to be paid early in 2018 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2017 or early 2018 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2017 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above under “market risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

 20  

our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate the anticipated returns 

we invest in certain projects that are entitled to taxadvantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law including renewable energy development historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing and we may make other taxadvantaged investments from time to time our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and in some cases through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities the addition of our property business which includes the results of our homeowners business beginning in april 2015 may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results compared to prior periods 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

the closing price of our common shares on january 31 2017  was 3744 

b holders 

we had 2152 shareholders of record on december 31 2016  

c dividends 

we maintain a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year this annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of aftertax underwriting income multiplied by a companywide performance factor “gainshare factor” subject to the limitations discussed below the target percentage is determined by our board of directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public in december 2015  the board determined the target percentage for 2016  to be 3313 of annual aftertax underwriting income which is unchanged from the target percentage in both 2015  and 2014  the board also determined that this target will remain at 3313 for 2017  

the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the vehicle businesses for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives as approved by the compensation committee of the board beginning in 2017 the operating performance of our property business with minor exclusions will also be a component in determining the gainshare factor this gainshare factor is also used in the annual cash incentive program currently in place for our employees our “gainsharing program” if the gainshare factor is zero or if our comprehensive income is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend would be payable under our annual variable dividend policy 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual variable dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual variable dividend for 2017  or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position 

 22  

following is a summary of our shareholder dividends that were declared in the last three years 

1 based on an estimate of shares outstanding as of the record date for the dividends declared in december 2015 and 2014 we paid 5190 million and 4041 million respectively 

consolidated statutory surplus was 86 billion  on december 31 2016  and 76 billion on december 31 2015  at december 31 2016  7227 million  of consolidated statutory surplus represented net admitted assets of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile the companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile however which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements generally the net admitted assets of insurance companies that subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed based on the dividend laws currently in effect the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of 11615 million  in 2017  without prior approval from regulatory authorities provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary 

in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in arx the progressive corporation entered into a stockholders’ agreement with the other arx stockholders among other provisions the stockholders’ agreement prohibits arx from taking a number of actions including the payment of dividends without the consent of the progressive corporation and two other stockholders

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information  in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we had net premiums written of  206 billion  in 2015  compared to  187 billion  in 2014  and  173 billion  in 2013  our combined ratio which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less fees and other revenues by our net premiums earned was 925  in 2015  923  in 2014  and 935  in 2013  

organization 

our operations are run by our executive team which consists of our chief executive officer and the heads of our major business areas that report to him a chief financial officer personal lines chief operating officer plcoo president of commercial lines chief investment officer chief legal officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer and the presidents of personal lines claims and customer relationships each of whom report to the plcoo our property business is headed by the president and chief executive officer of arx who reports to the arx board of directors we appoint three of the five members of the arx board 

our insurance and claims organizations are generally managed on a statebystate basis due to the nature of insurance legal and regulatory requirements and other local factors and are supplemented by national operations and supported by our corporate functions as appropriate statespecific organizations typically report to a regional manager who then reports to the applicable group president separate managers and organizations are responsible for australia and our california agency operations 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles as of december 31 2015 we write personal auto insurance in all 50 states and the district of columbia and we write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states we also write personal auto insurance in australia 

this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for 86 of total net premiums written in 2015 and 

 2  

90 in both 2014 and 2013 our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” below for further discussion 

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2014  based on net premiums written and believe that we continued to hold that position during 2015  there are approximately 310 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 20 billion of premiums annually comprise about 79 of this market for 2014  the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1835 billion and our share of this market was approximately 89 which was up 02 compared to 2013  comparable industry data is not available for 2015  at this time all industry data including ranking and market share was obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

 our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 in our personal lines segment w e are continuing to focus on our efforts to further penetrate customer households through crossselling auto policies with other products including through progressive home advantage ® pha to meet a broad range of customer needs pha is the program in which we “bundle” our auto product with property insurance provided by asi primarily in the agency channel or unaffiliated insurance carriers in the direct channel in addition we introduced the platinum product which is a home and auto insurance combined offering that provides the agents a single offering with compensation coordinated policy periods single event deductible and other features that meet the needs and desires that our agents have expressed platinum is targeted to those agents who have the appropriate customers and believe our bundled offering is a must have for their agency bundled products are becoming an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda these customers represent a sizable segment of the market and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs

commercial lines 

the commercial lines business writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned andor operated predominately by small businesses as a part of the commercial auto market we offer these products in 49 states we do not currently write commercial lines products in hawaii or the district of columbia this business represented 11 of our total net premiums written in 2015 and 10 during each of the two preceding years our commercial lines customers on average insure approximately two vehicles even though we continue to write over 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel net premiums written through the direct channel increased by 12 in 2015 the commercial lines business operates in the following business market targets 

 although commercial lines differs from personal lines auto in its customer base and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

there are approximately 330 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 37 other large companiesgroups each with over 150 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 78 of this market our commercial lines business ranked second in the commercial auto insurance market for 2014 based on net premiums written we expect final industry data for 2015 to show that we were ranked first in the commercial auto market for the year 

property 

asi one of the 20 largest homeowners carriers in the united states specializes in personal and commercial property insurance personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance there are approximately 380 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide the top 20 carriers comprise about 76 of the market 

our property business writes homeowners and renters insurance primarily in the agency channel in 31 states and the district of columbia for personal property insurance and in 4 states for commercial property insurance we also write flood insurance in 37 states and dc property policies are generally written on a 12month basis as discussed above asi is the exclusive provider of homeowners products for new pha business in our agency channel 

our property business represented about 3 of our total net premiums written in 2015 we tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters based on the nature of property sales losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent approximately 97 of the property net premiums written were for policies covering personal residential property single family homes condominium unit owners rental coverage etc with the remaining 3 covering commercial property and other coverages the commercial business principally includes insurance covering real estate owned by condominium and homeowners associations and similar entities as well as apartment complexes for 2015 texas and florida comprised just over half of our property business based on premium volume 

asi has exposure to losses from catastrophes and other severe storms to help mitigate these risks asi purchases reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurance companies most of which are “a” rated by am best and from a reinsurance company established as part of a catastrophe bond transaction in addition asi purchases statemandated hurricane reinsurance in florida with respect to 2015 approximately 26 of asi’s premiums written were ceded including approximately 10 ceded under catastrophe reinsurance programs 

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability business we had only five professional liability policies in force as of december 31 2015 although we continue to process claims on expired policies 

 4  

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 in our direct business through progressive home advantage ®  we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by unaffiliated insurance companies on a nationwide basis we receive commissions for policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

through progressive commercial advantage sm  we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies this program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout the continental united states and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of december 31 2015 we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

claims 

we manage our vehicle claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 215 standalone claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we operate 67 service centers in 51 metropolitan areas across the country of which 53 have combined claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency and manage costs insureds and other claimants can elect to have their vehicles repaired by their own repair shops have their vehicles repaired by one of our network shops or have the entire repair process coordinated by one of our service centers if a customer elects to repair their vehicle through a service center we provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete this innovative patented approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to our other claims settlement processes under the service center and network shop options we guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car if a customer decides not to repair their vehicle our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot asi handles property claims separately through a network primarily of independent claims adjusters

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position 

in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry some of our competitors have many more patents than we do a year ago we had eight us patents and additional patent applications pending with respect to certain methods systems and devices related to usagebased insurance certain of these patents expired in january 2016 the other patents have been invalidated by the patent trial and appeal board ptab of the us patent and trademark office all appeals have been exhausted as a result of the foregoing we no longer have any enforceable patents related to usagebased insurance nonetheless we continue to have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 15 billion driving miles derived from usagebased devices we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market 

we also hold a us patent expiring in 2021 and have a us patent application pending on the innovative approach to vehicle repair service used in our service centers as described above and two us patents expiring in 2028 on the name your price ®  functionality on our website in addition we hold two patents expiring in 2019 related to our online policy selfservice technology two related patents were successfully challenged in actions filed with the ptab in conjunction with the proceedings described above and all appeals have been exhausted 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile our insurance subsidiaries and our mutual insurance company affiliate are domiciled in the states of delaware florida indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2015  we had net premiums written of  206 billion  and statutory surplus of 76 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 27 to 1 reflecting a lower premiumstosurplus ratio maintained on our property business in addition as of december 31 2015  we had access to 13 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2015  our rbc ratios were well in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c below for further information on these dividend limitations the scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the naic in 2010 

 7  

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary since 2010 the federal insurance office has been required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in addition to our us operations we write personal auto physical damage and auto property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is primarily offered through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission which regulates consumer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority which regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdictions issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below

investments 

our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 209 billion  at december 31 2015  compared to 190 billion  at december 31 2014  investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 5673 million in 2015  compared to 6326 million in 2014  and 7404 million in 2013  on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in unrealized gainslosses investment income was 2429 million 7479 million and 8700 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively for more detailed discussion see note 2 – investments note 3 – fair value and  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the annual report 

employees 

the number of employees at december 31 2015  was 28580 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation including 620 employees employed by arx and its subsidiaries and affiliates 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of our insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices primarily for our vehicle businesses can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on august 26 2015 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 



1 net reserves acquired in arx acquisition 

 10  

our reserves developed favorably by 3151 million  in 2015 and 241 million  in 2014 compared to unfavorable development of 451 million  in 2013 which is reflected as “incurred related to prior years” in the table above total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than anticipated 

during 2015 favorable reserve development was recognized in all of our segments with personal lines accounting for about 70 and the remainder split between our commercial lines and property businesses the personal auto and commercial lines development was primarily related to bodily injury and uninsured motorist bodily injury coverages due to lower than anticipated severity for the property business the favorable development was due to lower than anticipated frequency and severity 

during 2014 favorable reserve development in our commercial lines business was primarily related to favorable case reserve development on our high limit policies this favorable development was partially offset by unfavorable development in our agency auto business which was primarily in our personal injury protection pip loss reserves and our adjusting and other lae reserves our direct auto business experienced slight favorable development 

during 2013 unfavorable reserve development in our commercial lines business was primarily attributable to higher frequency and severity on late emerging ibnr claims primarily in bodily injury coverage for our truck business in addition unfavorable development in our personal lines business reflected unfavorable reserve development in our agency auto business ibnr reserves due to higher frequency and severity on late emerging claims offset in large part by favorable development in our direct auto business due to lower than anticipated severity costs on case reserves we also experienced unfavorable reserve development in our other businesses primarily due to reserve increases in our runoff professional liability group business based on internal actuarial reviews of our claims history 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves

1 reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses for 2014 include 419 million related to the balance of arxs reinsurance recoverables upon acquisition 

2 represents loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on net unpaid losses at the balance sheet date 

3 cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and lae  net 

 12  

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 2005 through 2014 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at december 31 for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the middle portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the balance sheet date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2015 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 53586 million  of the currently estimated 54064 million  of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2006  thus an estimated 478 million of losses incurred through 2006 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the “net cumulative development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 2005 liability has developed favorably by 2029 million  over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2006 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 11 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2014 but incurred in 2011 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2011 2012 and 2013 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

the favorable reserve development for 2005 and 2007 through 2010 was about 2 to 8 of our original carried reserves which primarily reflects the decreases in severity between our original estimate and what we experienced in both our personal auto and commercial auto businesses during that period for 2011 2012 and 2013 we experienced very minimal development or less than 1 of our original estimate the favorable development for 2014 primarily reflects lower than anticipated severity than was originally estimated in all segments 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 13 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2014 we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be 12278 million  during 2015 these reserves developed unfavorably by 757 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to 13035 million  as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we have experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the majority of this development reflects our continuing process of reevaluating michigan pip claims that require lifetime reserve estimates as a result we have increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded indirectly through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal for our property business the development during 2015 was consistent on a gross and net basis 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 13 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments 

d financial information about geographic areas 

we operate our businesses throughout the united states we also sell personal auto physical damage and auto property damage liability insurance in australia for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  net premiums earned in our australian business were 159 million 171million and 130 million respectively the amount of australian assets is immaterial to our consolidated financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

our business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit and other financial risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold home ownership trends inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur also to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business 

we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may develop into actual events and impact our businesses if any one or more of them does so the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 15  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 11 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which primarily discusses our vehicle business reserves and was filed with the sec on form 8k on august 26 2015 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or by other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the frequency and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools and thirdparty experts to help estimate our exposure to such events those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our homeowners and other businesses at reasonable cost and collect under our reinsurance contracts 

like many homeowners insurance companies our property business relies on reinsurance contracts state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds collectively “reinsurance arrangements” to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events and its aggregate exposure to certain other severe storms we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses reinsurance arrangements are often subject to an aggregate dollar coverage limit so if a significant catastrophe or other events are covered by reinsurance our claims liabilities arising from those events may 

 16  

exceed our reinsurance coverage in addition although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured as a result we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay or will dispute reinsurance claims further the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all the availability and cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume profitability or financial condition 

ii operating risks 

we compete in propertycasualty markets that are highly competitive 

we write insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles commercial autos and trucks for small businesses and homeowners renters and commercial property owners all of these markets are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills operational effectiveness pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised in addition because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business we may be more sensitive than other insurers to and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time 

historically the auto and property insurance markets have been known as cyclical with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels as insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophe fund our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders such events could materially adversely affect our financial results brand and future business prospects 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors’ initiatives 

our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with the systems of third parties as a result if we do not handle these transitions effectively and efficiently the quality of our products our relationships with our customers and agents and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected in addition innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected 

 17  

we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences 

ongoing competitive technological regulatory informational and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business these risks include our increasing reliance on thirdparty systems the development of new modes of communication changing insurance shopping trends and the availability of very large volumes of data ie big data and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of highquality products and customer and agent experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to the increased difficulty in executing our business strategies 

intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations 

there has been a proliferation of patents both inside and outside the insurance industry that significantly impacts our businesses the existence of such patents and other claimed intellectual property rights may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings substantial monetary damages or expensive changes in our business processes and practices similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges and enforcing and defending our rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain which can further complicate business plans 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a costeffective manner could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness customer retention financial results prospects and liquidity 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition enhance perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us whether due to our business practices the conduct of our officers or employees the actions of businesses with which we do business including unaffiliated insurers through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners or other causes the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technological analytical and other skills and knowhow necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses our loss of certain officers and key employees or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing or understaffing in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

 18  

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information privacy and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances and dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions 

for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 7 of this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations additional litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges relating to our network of repair facilities or our service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies policy implementation and renewal procedures and employmentrelated litigation including federal wage and hour claims among other matters additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

 19  

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations for further information on pending litigation see note 12  litigation  in the annual report 

our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information all of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees consultants agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems such attacks or actions may include attempts to 

 some of our systems rely on thirdparty vendors through either a connection to or an integration with those thirdparties’ systems this approach may increase the risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack thirdparty risks may include among other factors lax thirdparty’s security measures data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards and review of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time therefore the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyberattack if sufficiently severe could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group including those related to data security we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

 20  

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems an interruption of service from a third party for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies provide customer service resolve claims in a timely manner make payments when required or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects as well as damage to our brand and customer goodwill 

the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company and our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired 

 the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to us or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated at the time of the arx acquisition we recorded goodwill and intangible assets at fair value goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually valuing these assets and evaluating their recoverability requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity margins growth rates discount rates and other matters and our estimates may change over time potentially resulting in writedowns of the assets goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results divestitures or sustained market declines among other factors and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio consists principally of fixedincome securities and common equities general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income or result in realized or unrealized investment losses 

our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we hold credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

 21  

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets any disruption in the functioning of those markets or our ability to liquidate investments when desired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations in addition if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2015 and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

iv credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance arrangements used by us our corporate insurance policies and the performance of state reinsurance facilitiesassociations in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase securities or meet other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions or are able to pay only limited amounts the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

  22  

in addition under the arx stockholders’ agreement arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and other specified arx stockholders further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors these could include increased regulatory requirements losses in our insurance or investment operations or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write among others if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed whether due to our results volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control or other reasons our financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such an event unless and until additional sources of capital are secured we may be limited in our ability or unable to service our debt obligations pay dividends grow our business pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators potentially resulting in regulatory actions and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

our access to capital markets ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

our annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2015 and 2016 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our gainsharing cash bonus plans for most of our employees and based on the operating performance of our vehicle insurance businesses if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes the change in unrealized investment gains and losses among other items is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2016 to be paid early in 2017 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2016 or early 2017 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2016 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above under “market risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities the addition of our property business 

 23  

which includes the results of our homeowners business beginning in april 2015 may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results compared to prior periods 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

the closing price of our common shares on january 29 2016  was 3125 

b holders 

we had 2255 shareholders of record on december 31 2015  

c dividends 

we maintain a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year this annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of aftertax underwriting income multiplied by a companywide performance factor “gainshare factor” subject to the limitations discussed below the target percentage is determined by our board of directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public in december 2014  the board determined the target percentage for 2015  to be 3313 of annual aftertax underwriting income which is unchanged from the target percentage in both 2014  and 2013  the board also determined that this target will remain at 3313 for 2016  

the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives for our vehicle insurance businesses as approved by the compensation committee of the board this gainshare factor is also used in the annual cash incentive program currently in place for our employees our “gainsharing program” although reviewed every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual dividend program will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year subject to certain limitations if the gainshare factor is zero or if our comprehensive income is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend would be payable under our annual variable dividend policy 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual variable dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual variable dividend for 2016  or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position

following is a summary of our shareholder dividends both variable and special 

1 based on shares outstanding as of the record date 

consolidated statutory surplus was 76 billion  on december 31 2015  and 64 billion on december 31 2014  at december 31 2015  6376 million  of consolidated statutory surplus represented net admitted assets of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile the companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile however which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements generally the net admitted assets of insurance companies that subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed based on the dividend laws currently in effect the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of 13250 million  in 2016  without prior approval from regulatory authorities provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary 

in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in arx the progressive corporation entered into a stockholders’ agreement with the other arx stockholders among other provisions the stockholders’ agreement prohibits arx from taking a number of actions including the payment of dividends without the consent of the progressive corporation and two other stockholders

 item 1 business 

a general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has 53 subsidiaries one mutual insurance company affiliate and one limited partnership investment affiliate our insurance subsidiaries and mutual insurance company affiliate provide personal auto insurance commercial auto and truck insurance principally for small businesses and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services our propertycasualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our noninsurance subsidiaries and limited partnership investment affiliate generally support our insurance and investment operations we operate our businesses throughout the united states and sell personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance on an internetonly basis in australia 

in december 2014 we signed a purchase agreement to acquire a controlling interest in arx holding corp arx the parent company of american strategic insurance corp asi and its affiliates our current provider of homeowners insurance in the agency channel see narrative description of businesspending acquisition  for further discussion 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information  in the 2014 annual report to shareholders of the progressive corporation and subsidiaries the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 187 billion  in 2014  compared to 173 billion  in 2013  and 164 billion  in 2012  our combined ratio which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses net of fees and other revenues by our net premiums earned was 923  in 2014  935  in 2013  and 956  in 2012  

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community we are organized as follows 

  2  

our executive management team sets policies and makes key strategic decisions this team includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer as well as our three presidents discussed above the presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 90 of total net premiums written during each of the last three years our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” below for further discussion 

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2013  based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2014  there are approximately 310 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 14 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 20 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2013  the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1745 billion and our share of this market was approximately 87 compared to 1680 billion and 85 in 2012  respectively comparable industry data is not available for 2014  at this time all industry data including ranking and market share was obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

  3  

our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 in our personal lines segment we are also continuing with our efforts to further penetrate customer households through crossselling auto policies with our special lines products and vice versa as well as through progressive home advantage ® pha pha is the program in which we “bundle” our auto product with property insurance provided by unaffiliated insurance carriers bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda as of december 31 2014 pha was available to direct customers in 49 states agency customers in 26 states including three states added during 2014 and to both direct and agency customers in the district of columbia pha is available to agency customers in florida and in 2014 was made available to direct customers in that state pha is not yet available to customers in alaska in the direct channel pha is provided by 12 unaffiliated insurance carriers in the agency channel asi will be our exclusive provider of homeowners products for new business see pending acquisition below for further discussion 

commercial lines 

the commercial lines business writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned andor operated predominately by small businesses as a part of the commercial auto market this business represented approximately 10 of our total net premiums written during each of the last three years our commercial lines customers on average insure approximately two vehicles even though we continue to write over 90 of our commercial lines business through the agency channel net premiums written through the direct channel increased by 13 in 2014 the commercial lines business operates in the following business market targets 

 business auto is our largest business market target measured by premium volume and accounts for approximately one third of our total commercial lines premiums while the forhire transportation and contractor business market targets each account for about another 25 business auto and contractor together account for approximately 75 of the vehicles we insure in this business while forhire transportation accounts for about 10 although commercial lines differs from personal lines auto in its customer base and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

there are approximately 340 competitors in the total us commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 37 other large companiesgroups each with over 150 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial lines business ranked second in the commercial auto insurance market for 2013  based on net premiums written we estimate this business to be ranked in the top two for 2014 

 4  

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability business which was sold in 2010 pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business from the date of sale through april 30 2012 we continued to write these policies principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks all professional liability insurance policies written in july 2010 and later were 100 reinsured from august 2009 through june 2010 the substantial majority of the risks on this business were 100 reinsured and prior to august 2009 a majority of the risks on this business were reinsured we have only 15 policies in force as of december 31 2014 

pending acquisition 

in december 2014 we signed a purchase agreement to acquire a controlling interest in arx the parent company of asi and its affiliates asi one of the 20 largest homeowners carriers in the united states specializes in personal and commercial property insurance personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance after closing we expect that asi will continue to be the exclusive provider of homeowners products for new business in our agency channel 

the transaction is expected to close in april 2015 subject to closing conditions at an estimated cost of 875 million if the transaction closes we expect that progressive and the other continuing arx shareholders and stock option holders will enter into a new stockholders’ agreement to address the parties’ respective rights and obligations after the closing among other provisions the stockholders’ agreement will provide the nonprogressive shareholders with rights to put all of their shares to progressive in two installments one in early 2018 and one in early 2021 progressive likewise will have the right to call shares from the other arx shareholders in each of 2018 and 2021 if these rights are exercised in full when available progressive’s ownership stake in arx capital stock would exceed 80 in 2018 and progressive would acquire all of the remaining capital stock of arx in 2021 the purchase prices for shares to be purchased by progressive pursuant to these put or call rights will be determined by adding a the price per share paid in the closing currently expected in april 2015 to b the product of the change in the per share net tangible book value of arx between december 31 2014 and december 31 2017 for the 2018 put or call purchases or december 31 2020 for the 2021 put or call purchases times a multiple of between 10 and 20 the multiple will be determined based on the growth and profitability of arx’s business over the applicable time period pursuant to criteria to be included in the stockholders’ agreement 

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 in our direct business through progressive home advantage ®  we offer home condominium and renters insurance among other products written by unaffiliated insurance companies we receive commissions for policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program progressive home advantage is not currently available to customers in alaska 

through progressive commercial advantage sm  we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies this program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout the continental united states and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of december 31 2014 we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

 5  

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 270 claims offices located throughout the united states we have in operation 67 service centers in 51 metropolitan areas across the country of which 44 have combined claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency and manage costs insureds and other claimants can elect to have their vehicles repaired by their own repair shops have their vehicles repaired by one of our network shops or have the entire repair process coordinated by one of our service centers if a customer elects to repair their vehicle through a service center we provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete this innovative patented approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to our other claims settlement processes under the service center and network shop options we guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car if a customer decides not to repair their vehicle our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

competition in our insurance market is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to adapt to change innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions we have eight us patents and additional patent applications pending with respect to certain methods systems and devices related to usagebased insurance certain of these patents expire on or about january 29 2016 while others extend well beyond that date three of these eight patents were challenged in actions filed with the patent trial and appeal board ptab of the us patent and trademark office the challenger prevailed in the initial proceeding on all three of those patents perhaps more significantly we have a substantial amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 12 billion driving miles derived from usagebased devices we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market we also hold a us patent expiring june 2021 and have a us patent application pending on the innovative approach to vehicle repair service used in our service centers as described above and a us patent expiring in june 2028 on the name your price ®  functionality on our website in addition we hold four patents expiring july 2019 and additional patent applications pending related to our online policy selfservice technology two of these four patents have been challenged in actions filed with the ptab the challenger has prevailed in these initial proceedings we have appealed all of the adverse rulings from the ptab the patents that are the subject of these rulings remain valid and in effect until all appeals are exhausted 

in addition we have licensed certain of our patent rights for domestic use to other insurance companies and we continue to pursue other ways in which to leverage this intellectual property currently we do not expect these licensing activities to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its mutual insurance company affiliate are domiciled in the states of indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain progressive subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2014  we had net premiums written of 187 billion  and statutory surplus of 64 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 29 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2014  we had access to 19 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2014  progressive’s rbc ratios were well in excess of minimum requirements 

 7  

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c below for further information on these dividend limitations the scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the naic in 2010 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act created a new federal insurance office which is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in addition to our us operations we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is offered solely through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission which regulates consumer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority which regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing

investments 

our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 190 billion  at december 31 2014  compared to 181 billion  at december 31 2013  investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 6326 million in 2014  compared to 7404 million in 2013  and 7498 million in 2012  on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in unrealized gainslosses investment income was 7479 million 8700 million and 10266 million for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively for more detailed discussion see note 2 – investments note 3 – fair value and  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on august 8 2014 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

  



 10  

our reserves developed favorably by 241 million in 2014 compared to unfavorable development of 451 million in 2013 and 220 million in 2012 which is reflected as “incurred related to prior years” in the table above total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than anticipated 

during 2014 favorable reserve development in our commercial lines business was primarily related to favorable case reserve development on our high limit policies this favorable development was partially offset by unfavorable development in our agency auto business which was primarily in our personal injury protection pip loss reserves and our adjusting and other lae reserves our direct auto business experienced slight favorable development 

during 2013 unfavorable reserve development in our commercial lines business was primarily attributable to higher frequency and severity on late emerging ibnr claims primarily in bodily injury coverage for our truck business in addition unfavorable development in our personal lines business reflected unfavorable reserve development in our agency auto business ibnr reserves due to higher frequency and severity on late emerging claims offset in large part by favorable development in our direct auto business due to lower than anticipated severity costs on case reserves we also experienced unfavorable reserve development in our other businesses primarily due to reserve increases in our runoff professional liability group business based on internal actuarial reviews of our claims history 

during 2012 unfavorable reserve development in our personal auto product was primarily attributable to reserve development in our florida pip coverage and an increase in our estimate of bodily injury severity for accident year 2011 in addition unfavorable development in our commercial lines business reflected higher than anticipated frequency and severity costs on late emerging claims and higher settlements on large losses this unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable reserve adjustments primarily in our loss adjustment expense reserves and our personal auto bodily injury reserves for accident years 2009 and 2008 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves

1 represents loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on net unpaid losses at the balance sheet date 

2 cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and lae  net 

 12  

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 2004 through 2013 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at december 31 for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the middle portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the balance sheet date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2014 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 50612 million of the currently estimated 51006 million of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2005 thus an estimated 394 million of losses incurred through 2005 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the “net cumulative development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 2004 liability has developed favorably by 4297 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2005 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 11 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2014 but incurred in 2011 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2011 2012 and 2013 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2004 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year the favorable reserve development for 2007 through 2010 was about 3 to 9 of our original carried reserves which primarily reflects the decreases in severity between our original estimate and what we experienced in both our personal auto and commercial auto businesses during that period for 2011 2012 and 2013 we experienced very minimal development or less than 1 of our original estimate 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 13 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2013 we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be 10459 million during 2014 these reserves developed unfavorably by 578 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to 11037 million as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we have experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the majority of this development reflects our continuing process of reevaluating michigan pip claims that require lifetime reserve estimates as a result we have increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 13 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors 

progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

in addition we discuss below certain risks associated with our entering into an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in arx holding corp 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially 

this information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 15  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 11 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on august 8 2014 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools and thirdparty experts to help estimate our exposures to such events those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance cash flows and results of operations 

ii operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information and other technologies pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors 

 16  

our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses all of which are highly competitive markets if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised in addition due to our focus on the auto insurance market we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time for example if governmental mandates or restrictions economic conditions demographic trends changing driving patterns rising gasoline prices advancements in vehicle technology or safety features or other factors were to result in decreased demand for auto insurance or decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies as a result of varying loss cost experiences trend recognition capabilities and profitability goals the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted but which may or may not be favorable for progressive’s business prospects at that time in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophic fund we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders which could strain our service capabilities in the near term 

our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively respond to our competitors’ initiatives and efficiently manage complexity while delivering high quality products and services 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment these innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk which makes their implementation a challenge in addition our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with or in reliance on thirdparty vendors and their systems which may further limit our control of implementation quality customer experiences and successful outcomes our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry and adversely affect our competitive position these developments can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technological advances or new ways of doing business among other initiatives recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace include new ways for customers to shop and compare prices from multiple companies the growth in mobile communications and consumers’ desire to transact business on mobile devices the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers and the availability of very large volumes of data and the challenges related to analyzing those data sets sometimes referred to as “big data” our ability to react to such advances develop and maintain winning strategies and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success 

 17  

ongoing competitive technological regulatory and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business this complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing highquality products and customer experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies in addition we must make difficult decisions regarding the optimal allocation of available resources such as information technology resources for competing initiatives or projects 

complexity in our industry is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed sold and serviced which may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their patent rights similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however defending our business practices against patent challenges and enforcing and defending our patent rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain further complicating business plans related to these efforts 

if we are unable to manage this complexity effectively to bring new ideas to market to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources or to prevent errors our businesses could experience a decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business poor experiences for customers substantially increased costs liability to third parties the need to modify our business processes regulatory investigations and sanctions and damage to our brand 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition enhance consumers’ perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company these situations might include among others failing to protect sensitive customer information systems failures effects of actual or perceived vulnerabilities to cyber attacks such as computer hacking data theft system disruption and viruses and malware errors in handling a customer’s policy inappropriate handling of claims misconduct by our officers directors or employees or others acting on our behalf inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of thirdparty systems that we use facility shutdowns or other causes litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices and actions by our other business partners including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners insurance and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors moreover the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technical analytical and other skills necessary for us to run our business our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships employee morale and brand could be materially adversely affected 

 18  

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information privacy and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by courtimposed interpretations of those laws or regulations such as in recent years matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in certain cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary at this time we are unable to predict whether any additional state or federal laws or regulations will be enacted as a result of legislative regulatory or reform efforts and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report 

 19  

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the effectiveness of our service center program and other methods of resolving claims our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness financial results prospects and liquidity 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits have recently included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges to our direct repair program and service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies policy implementation and renewal procedures and employmentrelated litigation including federal wage and hour claims among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of courtimposed regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12  litigation  in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information these systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities such attacks may include among other things attempts to gain unauthorized access to 

 

similarly an employee consultant agent or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems and in the loss corruption or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees 

 20  

we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of thirdparty vendors which may provide software data storage communication and other computer services to us some of which may be referred to as “cloud computing” these thirdparty systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches along with the possible risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of progressive’s information or the confidential information of our customers and employees these relationships present further risk management challenges for us including among others confirming and monitoring the thirdparty’s security measures the potential for improper handling of or access to or the inability to retrieve our data and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection examples include physical security measures access and password policies firewalls systems monitoring malicious code protection network and hostbased intrusion detection and prevention measures data loss prevention measures configuration assurance data encryption and event management as well as thirdparty testing in addition we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards and ongoing testing auditing and evaluation of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party’s systems are adversely affected in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments such as progressive must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information while the pci standards set a high bar for data security compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis in september 2014 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pcis data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations our facilities and systems could become unavailable inoperable or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes including without limitation natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks computer security breaches or cyber attacks as discussed above riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of thirdparty vendors or unavailability of communications facilities likewise we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for various reasons including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 

 21  

the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for a third party’s services exceeds capacity or if a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service resolve and pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill and to our brand 

we maintain insurance on our real property and other physical assets including coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage however the insurance will not compensate us for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of a computer data processing or telecommunications systems failure cyber attack or other event that is unrelated to covered property damage nor will the insurance necessarily compensate us for all losses resulting from covered events to help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of our operations we maintain backup systems or facilities for certain of our systems in addition if such a significant interruption occurs or is threatened we have developed processes designed to maintain certain of our business operations and if necessary to recover our systems after such an event has occurred we still may be exposed however should these measures prove to be unsuccessful or inadequate to protect against interruptions of systems where no backup currently exists or against severe multiple or prolonged service interruptions we have established emergency management teams which are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events the teams’ ability to respond successfully may be limited depending on the nature of the event the completeness and effectiveness of our plans to maintain business continuity and recover our systems upon the occurrence of such an event and other factors beyond our control 

we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house ach network other such networks or payment systems may be developed in the future our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory authorities if we fail to comply with legal requirements or a network’s rules we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties including in certain cases the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system such fines and penalties and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically could materially adversely affect our business and our brand 

our business is also highly dependent on access to and the operation of the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed also could adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

  22  

 

in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as energy technology or financial services which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital likewise the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors including sector or industry concentrations lack of geographic diversification and the performance of individual issuers 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

  23  

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business in any such event our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2014 and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

iv credit and other financial risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example contracts for the acquisition of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology facilities equipment and support and other systems and services that are integral to our operations agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies and the performance of certain state reinsurance facilitiesassociations relating to extreme events or certain catastrophic claims in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks other financial institutions or security clearinghouses if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product obligation or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems which in turn could adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase its securities or meet its other obligations 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase its common shares or other securities or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to meet regulatory requirements to support the growth of our insurance businesses to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends repurchase stock or other securities and fund corporate opportunities management determines our capital needs at any given time based on a number of factors including 

 

the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

if regulatory requirements for capital and surplus were to increase we likely would be required to increase the amount of capital held by our insurance subsidiaries also if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained and our flexibility to pay dividends repurchase our securities or engage in other corporate transactions could be limited until additional sources of capital are secured such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties such as rating agencies underwriters institutional and other investors and consumers potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral in cash or highgrade assets for the benefit of the other party to the transaction or allow the other party to liquidate the derivatives transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

 25  

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2014 and 2015 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2015 to be paid early in 2016 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2015 or early 2016 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2015 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above under “market risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares or debt securities 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers or increases in advertising spend to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

  

v   risks associated with the arx transaction 

the anticipated acquisition of control of arx holding corp may not occur or may occur on terms 

different than those initially contemplated 

it is possible that the contemplated acquisition of arx capital stock may not occur because the conditions to the closing of the transaction are not satisfied or for another reason in addition there is a risk that the transactions may not be consummated on the terms contemplated as a result of changed circumstances or because of requirements imposed by insurance or other regulatory authorities 

 26  

if the anticipated acquisition is consummated it may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company and may present new operational or other risks for us 

if the acquisition is consummated it may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated and arx may not perform as expected may have unknown liabilities and may present unanticipated operational or other risks arx will continue to be and the company will become dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of arx’s officers and key employees to execute their business plans in addition the homeowners insurance business differs from our current business in certain respects catastrophe losses including those caused by adverse weather conditions including hurricanes floods tornadoes and severe storms may impact homeowners insurance results more than they impact our current results further like many homeowners insurance companies arx relies on reinsurance contracts to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events nonetheless arx remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured and is subject to credit risk with respect to its ability to recover from reinsurers for the claims it paid 

our consolidated debt is expected to increase as a result of the acquisition and our debt rating may be adversely affected 

as of december 31 2014 arx had outstanding external borrowings of 1913 million a significant portion of which is secured by the stock of certain of arx’s key subsidiaries this debt will remain outstanding after the acquisition and it is possible that our debt rating could be adversely affected as a result which may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets and increase our interest expense on any future indebtedness 

the anticipated acquisition will affect our accounting and the comparability of our results 

if the acquisition is consummated the financial results of arx and its subsidiaries will be consolidated in our financial results reporting the results of a writer of homeowners insurance may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results particularly because we report our results on a monthly basis in addition because we will own less than one hundred percent of arx for some period of time the other holders of arx capital stock will have an interest in the assets and operating results of arx and their interests will be reflected on our financial statements these changes will introduce more complexity to our financial statements and may affect the ability of investors or analysts to assess our financial results

the closing price of our common shares on january 30 2015  was 2595 

b holders 

we had 2359 shareholders of record on december 31 2014  

c dividends 

we maintain a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year this annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of aftertax underwriting income multiplied by a companywide performance factor “gainshare factor” subject to the limitations discussed below the target percentage is determined by our board of directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public in december 2013  the board determined the target percentage for 2014  to be 3313 of annual aftertax underwriting income which is unchanged from the target percentage in both 2013  and 2012  the board also determined that this target will remain at 3313 for 2015  

the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives for our core insurance businesses as approved by the compensation committee of the board this gainshare factor is also used in the annual cash incentive program currently in place for our employees our “gainsharing program” although recalibrated every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual dividend program will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year subject to certain limitations if the gainshare factor is zero or if our comprehensive income is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend would be payable under our annual variable dividend policy 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual variable dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual variable dividend for 2015  or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information  in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 173 billion  in 2013  compared to 164 billion  in 2012  and 151 billion  in 2011  our combined ratio which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses net of fees and other revenues by our net premiums earned was 935  in 2013  956  in 2012  and 930  in 2011  

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

  2  

our customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california phoenix arizona and colorado springs colorado support our policy servicing agency distribution claims and direct sales operations 

our executive management team sets policies and makes key strategic decisions this team includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer as well as our three group presidents discussed above the group presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 90 of total net premiums written during each of the last three years our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” herein for further discussion 

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2012  based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2013  there are approximately 320 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 14 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 20 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2012  the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1679 billion and our share of this market was approximately 85 compared to 1633 billion and 81 in 2011  respectively comparable industry data is not available for 2013  at this time all industry data including ranking and market share was obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

  3  

our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 commercial lines 

the commercial lines business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned andor operated predominantly by small businesses and represented approximately 10 of our total net premiums written during each of the last three years the majority of our commercial lines customers insure two or fewer vehicles the commercial lines business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the following business market targets 

 business auto is our largest business market target measured by premium volume and accounts for approximately one third of our total commercial lines premiums while the forhire transportation and contractor business market targets each account for about another 25 business auto and contractor together account for approximately 75 of the vehicles we insure in this business while forhire transportation accounts for about 15 although commercial lines differs from personal lines auto in its customer base and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

there are approximately 340 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 32 other large companiesgroups each with over 140 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial lines business ranked second in the commercial auto insurance market for 2012  up one place from 2011 based on net premiums written we believe that we retained the number two position for 2013  

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability business which was sold in 2010 pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business from the date of sale through april 30 2012 we continued to write these policies principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks all professional liability insurance policies written in july 2010 and later were 100 reinsured from august 2009 through june 2010 the substantial majority of the risks on this business were 100 reinsured and prior to august 2009 a majority of the risk on this business was reinsured with various reinsurance entities 

 4  

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations primarily include 

 through progressive home advantage ®  we offer either directly or through our network of independent agents home condominium and renters insurance written by eleven unaffiliated homeowner’s insurance companies progressive home advantage is not currently available to customers in alaska and is available to only agency customers in florida for the policies written under this program in our direct business we receive commissions all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

through progressive commercial advantage sm  we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by seven unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with additional companies through unaffiliated insurance agencies this program offers general liability and business owners policies throughout the continental united states and workers’ compensation coverage in 44 states as of december 31 2013 we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 275 claims offices located throughout the united states in 48 metropolitan areas across the country we have in operation 63 service centers of which 30 have combined our claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency and manage costs insureds and other claimants can elect to have their vehicles repaired by their own repair shops have their vehicles repaired by one of our network shops or have the entire repair process coordinated by one of our service centers if a customer elects to repair their vehicle through a service center we provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete under the service center option we guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car if a customer decides not to repair their vehicle our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot this innovative patented approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to our other claims settlement processes 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online or mobile service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

 5  

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to innovate develop and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect its competitive position we have seven us patents and additional patents pending with respect to certain methods systems and devices related to usagebased insurance certain of these patents expire on or about january 29 2016 while others extend well beyond that date three of these seven patents have been challenged in actions filed with the patent trial and appeal board ptab of the us patent and trademark office the challenger has prevailed in the initial proceeding with respect to two of those patents and we are awaiting a ruling from the ptab with respect to the third patent we also have a significant amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with usagebased insurance and from analyzing the data from over 9 billion driving miles derived from usagebased devices we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market we also hold a us patent expiring june 2021 and a us patent application pending on our innovative approach to the vehicle repair service described above and a us patent expiring in june 2028 on the name your price ®  functionality on our website in addition we hold four patents expiring july 2019 and additional patents pending related to our online policy selfservice technology two of these four patents have been challenged in actions filed with the ptab the challenger has prevailed in these initial proceedings we intend to appeal all of the adverse rulings from the ptab the patents that are the subject of these rulings remain valid and in effect until all appeals are exhausted 

in addition we have licensed certain of our patent rights for domestic use to five other insurance companies we continue to pursue other ways in which to leverage this intellectual property currently we do not expect these licensing activities to have a material effect on our operations results of operations or financial condition in the current fiscal year 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its mutual insurance company affiliate are domiciled in the states of indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain progressive subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

  6  

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2013  we had net premiums written of 173 billion  and statutory surplus of 60 billion  the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 29 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2013  we had access to 18 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth and for other purposes as needed the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks at december 31 2013 progressive’s rbc ratios were well in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c herein for further information on these dividend limitations the scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the naic in 2010 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

 7  

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information the use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue and it is possible that the us congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act created a new federal insurance office which is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in addition to our us operations we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is offered solely through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission which regulates customer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority which regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing

investments 

our investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 181 billion at december 31 2013 compared to 165 billion at december 31 2012 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 7404 million in 2013 compared to 7498 million in 2012 and 5826 million in 2011 on a pretax total return basis ie total investment income plus changes in unrealized gainslosses investment income was 8700 million 10266 million and 4526 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on july 12 2013 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

  



 10  

our reserves developed unfavorably by 451 million in 2013 and 220 million in 2012 compared to favorable development of 2420 million in 2011 which is reflected as “incurred related to prior years” in the table above total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than anticipated 

during 2013 unfavorable reserve development in our commercial lines business was primarily attributable to higher frequency and severity on late emerging claims primarily in our bodily injury coverage for our truck business in addition unfavorable development in our personal lines business reflects unfavorable reserve development in our agency auto business ibnr reserves due to higher frequency and severity on late emerging claims offset in large part by favorable development in our direct auto business due to lower than anticipated severity costs on case reserves we also experienced unfavorable reserve development in our other businesses primarily due to reserve increases in our runoff professional liability group business based on recent internal actuarial reviews of our claims history 

during 2012 unfavorable reserve development in our personal auto product was primarily attributable to reserve development in our florida personal injury protection pip coverage and an increase in our estimate of bodily injury severity for accident year 2011 in addition unfavorable development in our commercial lines business reflects higher than anticipated frequency and severity costs on late emerging claims and higher settlements on large losses this unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable reserve adjustments primarily in our loss adjustment expense reserves and our personal auto bodily injury reserves for accident years 2009 and 2008 

in 2011 the favorable reserve development reflected the settlement of larger losses for amounts less than we originally reserved in our personal lines primarily in our personal auto product and commercial lines businesses we also experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs reflecting a combination of fewer claims being litigated as well as the fact that a greater percentage of these cases are now being handled by our inhouse counsel which is a costeffective alternative to using external law firms 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves

1 represents loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on net unpaid losses at the balance sheet date 

2 cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and lae  net 

 12  

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 2003 through 2012 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at december 31 for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the middle portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the balance sheet date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2013 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 44674 million of the currently estimated 44975 million of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2004 thus an estimated 301 million of losses incurred through 2004 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the “net cumulative development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 2003 liability has developed favorably by 2603 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2005 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 10 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2013 but incurred in 2010 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2010 2011 and 2012 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2003 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year or about 4 to 9 of our original carried amounts the favorable reserve development for 2007 through 2010 was about 3 to 9 of our original carried reserves which primarily reflects the decreases in severity between our original estimate and what we experienced in both our personal auto and commercial auto businesses during that period for 2011 and 2012 we experienced very minimal unfavorable development or less than 1 of our original estimate 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 12 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2012 we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be 8621 million during 2013 these reserves developed unfavorably by 1369 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to 9990 million as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we have experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the majority of this development reflects our continuing process of reevaluating michigan pip claims that require lifetime reserve estimates as a result we have increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal in addition during 2013 we experienced unfavorable development in our runoff professional liability group business based on internal actuarial reviews of our claims history the substantial majority of this business is reinsured 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 12 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors 

progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under insurance risks market risks and credit risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially 

this information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

 15  

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 10 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on july 12 2013 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools and thirdparty experts to help estimate our exposures to such events those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance cash flows and results of operations 

ii operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information and other technologies pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors 

 16  

our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses all of which are highly competitive markets if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised in addition due to our focus on the auto insurance market we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time for example if governmental mandates or restrictions economic conditions demographic trends changing driving patterns rising gasoline prices advancements in vehicle technology or safety features or other factors were to result in decreased demand for auto insurance or decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies as a result of varying loss cost experiences trend recognition capabilities and profitability goals the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted but which may or may not be favorable for progressive’s business prospects at that time in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophic fund we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders which could strain our service capabilities in the near term 

our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively respond to our competitors’ initiatives and efficiently manage complexity while delivering high quality products and services 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment these innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk which makes their implementation a challenge in addition our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with or in reliance on thirdparty vendors and their systems which may further limit our control of implementation quality customer experiences and successful outcomes our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry and adversely affect our competitive position these developments can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technological advances or new ways of doing business among other initiatives recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace include new ways for customers to shop and compare prices from multiple companies the growth in mobile communications and consumers’ desire to transact business on mobile devices the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers and the availability of very large volumes of data and the challenges related to analyzing those data sets sometimes referred to as “big data” our ability to react to such advances develop and maintain winning strategies and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success 

 17  

ongoing competitive technological regulatory and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business this complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing highquality products and customer experiences may require us to modify our business practices to adopt new systems or to upgrade or replace outdated systems each at significant expense and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies in addition we must make difficult decisions regarding the optimal allocation of available resources such as information technology resources for competing initiatives or projects 

complexity in our industry is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed sold and serviced which may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their patent rights similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us however defending our business practices against patent challenges and enforcing and defending our patent rights including if necessary through litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the results are inherently uncertain further complicating business plans related to these efforts 

if we are unable to manage this complexity effectively to bring new ideas to market to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources or to prevent errors our businesses could experience decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business poor experiences for customers substantially increased costs liability to third parties regulatory investigations and sanctions and damage to our brand 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition enhance consumers’ perceptions of us generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company these situations might include among others failing to protect sensitive customer information systems failures effects of cyber attacks such as computer hacking data theft system disruption and viruses and malware errors in handling a customer’s policy inappropriate handling of claims misconduct by our officers directors or employees or others acting on our behalf inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of thirdparty systems that we use facility shutdowns or other causes litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices and actions by our other business partners including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners insurance and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors moreover the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives other key managers and employees with strong technical analytical and other skills necessary for us to run our business our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships and brand could be materially adversely affected 

 18  

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information privacy and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by courtimposed interpretations of those laws or regulations such as in recent years matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary for example the federal insurance office fio collects information about the insurance industry and monitors the industry for systemic risk in december 2013 the fio submitted a report to congress recommending reforms intended to modernize and improve the us system of insurance regulation the report proposes significant changes to existing state regulations and includes a number of recommendations that would result in direct federal regulation of the insurance industry at this time we are unable to predict whether any additional state or federal laws or regulations will be enacted as a result of the fio report or as a result of other legislative regulatory or reform efforts and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

  

insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 6 of this report 

 19  

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the effectiveness of our service center program and other methods of resolving claims our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness financial results prospects and liquidity 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits have recently included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges to our direct repair program and service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies policy implementation and renewal procedures and employmentrelated litigation including federal wage and hour claims among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of medical or attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of courtimposed regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12  litigation  in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information these systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities such attacks may include among other things attempts to gain unauthorized access to 

 

similarly an employee consultant agent or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems and in the loss corruption or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees 

 20  

we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of thirdparty vendors which may provide software data storage communication and other computer services to us some of which may be referred to as “cloud computing” these thirdparty systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches along with the possible risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of progressive’s information or the confidential information of our customers and employees these relationships present further risk management challenges for us including among others confirming and monitoring the thirdparty’s security measures the potential for improper handling of or access to or the inability to retrieve our data and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security assurance examples include physical security measures access and password policies firewalls systems monitoring malicious code protection network and hostbased intrusion detection and prevention measures data loss prevention measures configuration assurance data encryption and event management as well as thirdparty testing in addition we seek to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards and ongoing testing auditing and evaluation of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party’s systems are adversely affected in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments such as progressive must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information while the pci standards set a high bar for data security compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis in september 2013 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pcis data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations our facilities and systems could become unavailable inoperable or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes including without limitation natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks computer security breaches or cyber attacks as discussed above riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of thirdparty vendors or unavailability of communications facilities likewise we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for various reasons including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 

 21  

the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for a third party’s services exceeds capacity or if a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated and if an alternate system process or vendor is not immediately available to us such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service resolve and pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions any such event could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill and to our brand 

our business is also highly dependent on access to and the operation of the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized securities rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

 22  

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as energy technology or financial services which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital likewise the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors including sector or industry concentrations lack of geographic diversification and the performance of individual issuers 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2013 and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

 23  

iv credit risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example contracts for the acquisition of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology facilities equipment and support and other systems and services that are integral to our operations agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks or other financial institutions if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems which in turn could adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to repay indebtedness make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase its securities 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates pay dividends to shareholders repurchase its common shares or other securities or meet its other obligations each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to meet regulatory requirements to support the growth of our insurance businesses to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends repurchase stock or other securities and fund corporate opportunities management determines our capital needs at any given time based on a number of factors including 

 

 24  

the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

if regulatory requirements for capital and surplus were to increase we would likely be required to increase the amount of capital that we hold at our insurance subsidiaries also if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained and our flexibility to pay dividends repurchase our securities or engage in other corporate transactions could be limited until additional sources of capital are secured such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties such as rating agencies underwriters institutional and other investors and consumers potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral in cash or highgrade assets for the benefit of the other party to the transaction or allow the other party to liquidate the derivatives transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2013 and 2014 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2014 to be paid early in 2015 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2014 or early 2015 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2014 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity financial position or prospects as described above under “market risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares or debt securities 

 25  

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers or increases in advertising spend to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

the closing price of our common shares on january 31 2014  was 2324 

b holders 

we had 2896 shareholders of record on december 31 2013  

c dividends 

we maintain a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year this annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of aftertax underwriting income multiplied by a companywide performance factor “gainshare factor” subject to the limitations discussed below the target percentage is determined by our board of directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public for 2013  the board determined the target percentage to be 3313 of annual aftertax underwriting income which is unchanged from the target percentage in both 2012  and 2011  the board also determined that this target will remain at 3313 for 2014  

the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives approved by the compensation committee of the board this gainshare factor is also used in the annual cash incentive program currently in place for our employees our “gainsharing program” although recalibrated every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual dividend program will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year subject to certain limitations if the gainshare factor is zero or if our comprehensive income is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend would be payable under our annual variable dividend policy 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual variable dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual variable dividend for 2014  or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position in december 2013  the board of directors declared an annual variable dividend which was paid in february 2014  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 29 2014  the amount of the dividend was 4929 per common share or 2939 million the 2012  annual variable dividend was declared by the board in december 2012  and paid to shareholders in february 2013  the total amount of dividends was 1720 million or 2845 per common share the 2011  annual dividend was declared by the board in december 2011  and paid to shareholders in february 2012  the total amount of dividends was 2494 million or 4072 per common share 

 27  

in addition to the annual variable dividend in february 2014 declared in december 2013 and november 2012 declared in october 2012 we returned 5963 million and 6047 million respectively to shareholders via special cash dividends of 100 per share each 

consolidated statutory surplus was 60 billion  on december 31 2013  and 56 billion on december 31 2012  at december 31 2013  5248 million of consolidated statutory surplus represented net admitted assets of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile generally the net admitted assets of insurance companies that subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed the companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile however which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements based on the dividend laws currently in effect the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of 11697 million in 2014 without prior approval from regulatory authorities provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 164 billion in 2012 compared to 151 billion in 2011 and 145 billion in 2010 our combined ratio which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses net of fees and other revenues by our net premiums earned was 956 in 2012 930 in 2011 and 924 in 2010 

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 our customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado support our policy servicing agency distribution claims and direct sales operations 

  

our executive management team sets policies and makes key strategic decisions this team includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer as well as our three group presidents discussed above the group presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 90 of total net premiums written during each of the last three years our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion 

we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2011 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2012 there are approximately 340 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 13 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 20 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2011 the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1630 billion and our share of this market was approximately 82 compared to 1601 billion and 79 in 2010 respectively comparable industry data is not available for 2012 at this time all industry data including ranking and market share was obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 

  

 our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 

  

 commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 10 of our total net premiums written during each of the last three years the 

  

majority of our commercial auto customers insure two or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the following business market targets 

 

  

  

  

  

 business auto is the largest business market target measured by premium volume and accounts for approximately one third of our total commercial auto premiums while the forhire transportation and contractor business market targets each account for another 25 business auto and contractor each account for approximately one third of the vehicles we insure in this business while forhire transportation accounts for about 15 although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

there are approximately 340 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 31 other large companiesgroups each with over 130 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial auto business ranked third in the commercial auto insurance market for 2011 and we believe that we will rank second for 2012 

other indemnity 

our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability business which was sold in 2010 pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business from the date of sale through april 30 2012 we continued to write these policies principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks which were 100 reinsured the sale of this business did not have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our operations primarily include 

 

  

 through progressive home advantage ®  we offer either directly or through our network of independent agents new and existing agency and direct customers home condominium and renters insurance written by unaffiliated homeowner’s insurance companies progressive home advantage is not available to customers in florida and alaska for the policies written under this program in our direct business we receive commissions all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

through progressive commercial advantage sm  we offer our customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are underwritten by four unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with other companies through an unaffiliated agency this program offers general liability and business owners policies in the 49 states where we write commercial auto insurance and workers’ compensation coverage in 14 states as of december 31 2012 we receive commissions for the policies written under this program all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

  

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 280 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 54 service centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide our concierge level claims service of which 14 have combined our claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency if a customer elects to repair their vehicle through this option these service centers provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then select a qualified repair shop arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete we also guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car if a customer decides not to repair their vehicle our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to our other claims settlement processes 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price agent commission rates consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional insurers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents with widely available comparative rating services consumers can easily compare prices among competitors many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts andor expanding their online service offerings over the past decade these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments an insurer’s ability to innovate develop and implement new applications and other technology can affect its competitive position in addition there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being offered sold and serviced we have six us patents and additional us patent applications pending with respect to certain methods systems and devices related to usagebased insurance certain of these patent rights expire on or about january 29 2016 while others extend well beyond that date we also have a significant amount of “knowhow” developed from years of experience with and data derived from over 5 billion miles related to usagebased insurance we believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usagebased insurance market during 2012 we began to pursue ways in which to leverage this intellectual property currently we do not expect these activities to have a material effect on our operations results of operations or financial condition in the current fiscal year we also hold a us patent expiring june 2021 and a us patent application pending on our innovative approach to the vehicle repair service described above and two patents expiring july 2019 and additional patents pending related to our online policy selfservice technology 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its mutual insurance company affiliate are domiciled in the states of indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain progressive subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

  

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2012 we had net premiums written of 164 billion and statutory surplus of 56 billion the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 29 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2012 we had access to 14 billion of securities held in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 

  

  

  

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c herein for further information on these dividend limitations the scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model holding company act promulgated by the naic in 2010 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers 

  

to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information the use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue and it is possible that the us congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act created a new federal insurance office which is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in addition to our us operations we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is offered solely through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission which regulates customer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority which regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing 

  

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

 investments 

our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 165 billion at december 31 2012 compared to 160 billion at december 31 2011 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 7498 million in 2012 compared to 5826 million in 2011 and 6162 million in 2010 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

  

employees 

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2012 was 25889 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on august 7 2012 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

 our reserves developed unfavorably by 220 million in 2012 and favorably by 2420 million and 3204 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively which is reflected as “incurred related to prior years” in the table above total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than anticipated 

during 2012 unfavorable reserve development in our personal auto product was primarily attributable to reserve development in our florida personal injury protection coverage pip and an increase in our estimate of bodily injury severity for accident year 2011 in addition unfavorable development in our commercial auto business reflects higher than anticipated frequency and severity costs on late emerging claims and higher settlements on large losses this unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable reserve adjustments primarily in our loss adjustment expense reserves and our personal auto bodily injury reserves for accident years 2009 and 2008 

in both 2011 and 2010 the favorable reserve development reflected the settlement of larger losses for amounts less than we originally reserved in our personal lines primarily in our personal auto product and commercial auto businesses we also experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs reflecting a combination of fewer claims being litigated as well as the fact that a greater percentage of these cases are now being handled by our inhouse counsel which is a costeffective alternative to using external law firms in addition for 2010 our ibnr reserves developed favorably due to lower severity and frequency of late emerging claims however in 2011 the number of late emerging claims increased over 2010 and was greater than anticipated by our carried ibnr thus we recognized unfavorable development on our total ibnr reserves 

  

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

  

  

  the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 2002 through 2011 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

  

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2012 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 40549 million of the currently estimated 40827 million of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2003 thus an estimated 278 million of losses incurred through 2003 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the “net cumulative development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 2002 liability has developed favorably by 1523 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2005 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 9 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2012 but incurred in 2009 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2009 2010 and 2011 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year or about 4 to 9 of our original carried amounts the reserve development for 2006 and 2007 was less than 4 of our original carried reserves for both 2008 and 2009 we experienced favorable reserve development of more than 6 of our original estimates which reflects the decreases in severity we experienced in both our personal auto about 4 and commercial auto about 6 businesses through 2012 the favorable development of approximately 5 for 2010 also reflects lower severity estimates for both personal auto and commercial auto but to a lesser extent than the previous two years in 2011 we experienced very minimal unfavorable development or less than 05 of our original estimate 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 11 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2011 we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be 7857 million during 2012 these reserves developed unfavorably by 288 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to 8145 million as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses this development primarily reflects our claims organization’s continuing process of reevaluating michigan pip claims that require lifetime reserve estimates as a result we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 11 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors tableend progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

  

  

  

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially 

this information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time 

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 9 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on august 7 2012 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions whether due to an increase in average temperatures global climate change or other causes may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools and thirdparty experts to help estimate our exposures to such events but those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change as a result our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance cash flows and results of operations 

ii operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and 

  

pricing capabilities the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition marketing skills operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information technology pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors 

our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses all of which are highly competitive markets if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised in addition due to our focus on the auto insurance market we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time for example if governmental restrictions economic conditions demographic trends changing driving patterns rising gasoline prices advancements in vehicle technology or safety features or other factors were to result in decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies as a result of varying loss cost experiences and profitability goals the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted but which may or may not be favorable for progressive’s business prospects at that time in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophic fund we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders which could strain our service capabilities in the near term 

our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively respond to our competitors’ initiatives and efficiently manage complexity 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment these innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk which makes their implementation a challenge in addition our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with or in reliance on thirdparty vendors and their systems which may further limit our control of implementation quality customer experiences and successful outcomes our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry these developments can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technological advances or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies among other initiatives the growth in mobile communications and the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers are recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace where we are committing substantial resources our ability to react to such advances develop and maintain winning strategies and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success 

the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses combined with ongoing technological regulatory and other developments results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business this complexity is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed sold and serviced eg mobile applications which may result in challenges to certain of our business practices by third parties including other insurance companies and noninsurance entities alleging that we are violating their patent rights similarly we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us enforcement of such patent rights through litigation however can be time consuming and is inherently uncertain potentially complicating business plans related to these efforts the complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing highquality products 

  

and customer experiences may require us to modify our business practices and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources such as it resources for competing initiatives or projects if we are unable to manage this complexity effectively to bring new ideas to market to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources or to prevent errors our businesses could experience decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business poor experiences for customers substantially increased costs liability to third parties regulatory investigations and sanctions and damage to our brand 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company these situations might include among others failing to protect sensitive customer information systems failures effects of cyber attacks such as computer hacking data theft system disruption and viruses and malware errors in handling a customer’s policy inappropriate handling of claims of policyholders or other parties misconduct by our officers directors or employees or others acting on our behalf inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of thirdparty systems that we use facility shutdowns or other causes litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices and actions by our other business partners including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners insurance and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors moreover the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate motivate and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships and brand could be materially adversely affected 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information privacy and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies or by courtimposed interpretations of those laws or regulations such as in recent years matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit among other things our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or 

  

decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold moreover inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general federal officials or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to significant monetary payments fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary for example the federal insurance office fio collects information about the insurance industry and monitors the industry for systemic risk if the fio were to recommend to the financial stability oversight council that progressive or the insurance industry as a whole is “systemically significant” we could be subject to additional regulation and our businesses could be affected significantly at this time we are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge level claims services program our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness financial results prospects and liquidity 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges to our direct repair program and service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employmentrelated practices allegations of medical or attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of courtimposed regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our 

  

business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12 – litigation in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information these systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities such attacks may include among other things attempts to gain unauthorized access to 

 

  

  

  

  

 similarly an employee consultant agent or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems and in the loss corruption or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees 

we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of thirdparty vendors which may provide software data storage and other computer services to us some of which may be referred to as “cloud computing” these thirdparty systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches along with the possible risk of loss corruption or unauthorized publication of progressive’s information or the confidential information of our customers and employees these relationships present further risk management challenges for us including among others confirming and monitoring the thirdparty’s security measures the potential for improper handling of or access to or the inability to retrieve our data and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security assurance examples include physical security measures access and password policies firewalls systems monitoring malicious code protection network and hostbased intrusion detection and prevention measures data loss prevention measures configuration assurance data encryption and event management as well as third party intrusion vulnerability testing in addition we seek to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards and ongoing testing auditing and evaluation of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party’s systems are adversely affected in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments such as progressive must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information while the pci standards set a high bar for data security compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis in august 2012 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pci’s data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

  

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations our facilities and systems could become unavailable inoperable or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes including without limitation natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks computer security breaches or cyber attacks as discussed above riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of thirdparty vendors or unavailability of communications facilities likewise we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for various reasons including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 

the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill 

our business is also highly dependent on access to and the operation of the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized securities rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and also may be 

  

subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above for example a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall particularly those of interestsensitive companies in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as the financial services industry which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital likewise the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors including sector or industry concentrations lack of geographic diversification and the performance of individual issuers 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2012 and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

iv credit risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example contracts for the acquisition of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology facilities equipment and support and other systems and services that are integral to our operations agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks or other financial institutions if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

  

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repurchase its securities repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or other securities or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to meet regulatory requirements to support the growth of our insurance businesses to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends repurchase stock or other securities and fund corporate opportunities the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based in part on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by regulatory requirements and the performance of our insurance operations and investment results including investment income valuation changes in our portfolio and the realization of any deferred tax benefits as well as by our capital management activities such as the payment of cash dividends repurchases of our common shares and debt securities the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt equity or other securities if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties such as rating agencies underwriters institutional and other investors and consumers potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral in cash or highgrade assets for the benefit of the other party to the transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2012 and 2013 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2013 to be paid early in 2014 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2013 or early 2014 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2013 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “investing risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares or debt securities 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers or increases in advertising spend to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

we had 3114 shareholders of record on december 31 2012 

c dividends 

progressive maintains a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year this annual variable dividend is based on a target percentage of aftertax underwriting income multiplied by a companywide performance factor “gainshare factor” subject to the limitations discussed below the target percentage is determined by our board of directors on an annual basis and announced to shareholders and the public the board determined the target percentage to be 3313 for both 2012 and 2011 and 25 for 2010 this target will remain at 3313 for 2013 the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing our operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives approved by the compensation committee of the board this gainshare factor is also used in the variable cash incentive program currently in place for our employees referred to as our “gainsharing program” although recalibrated every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual variable dividend program is subject to certain limitations if the gainshare factor is zero or if comprehensive income is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2013 or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position in december 2012 the board of directors declared an annual dividend which was paid in february 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 25 2013 the amount of the dividend was 2845 per common share or 1720 million the 2011 annual dividend was declared by the board in december 2011 and paid to shareholders in february 2012 the total amount of dividends was 2494 million or 4072 per common share the 2010 annual dividend was declared by the board in december 2010 and paid to shareholders in february 2011 the total amount of dividends was 2638 million or 3987 per common share

 item 1 business tableend a general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has 54 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate these insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services our propertycasualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our noninsurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations we operate our businesses throughout the united states and sell personal auto insurance on an internetonly basis in australia 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 151 billion in 2011 compared to 145 billion in 2010 and 140 billion in 2009 our combined ratio calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 930 in 2011 924 in 2010 and 916 in 2009 

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 our customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado support our policy servicing agency distribution claims and direct sales operations 

  

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions this team includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer as well as our three group presidents discussed above the group presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 90 of total net premiums written for each of the last three years our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion 

we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2010 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2011 there are approximately 350 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 19 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2010 the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1589 billion and our share of this market was approximately 80 compared to 1566 billion and 77 in 2009 respectively comparable industry data is not available for 2011 at this time all industry data including ranking and market share was obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

the personal lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products as well as our special lines products 

 

  

 our personal lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels 

 

  

 commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 10 of our total net premiums written for each of the last three years the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the following business market targets 

  

  

  

  

  

 business auto and contractor are the two largest business market targets and together account for approximately 60 of our total commercial auto premiums and approximately 75 of the vehicles we insure in this business although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

there are approximately 370 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 34 other large companiesgroups each with over 130 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial auto business ranked fourth in the commercial auto insurance market for 2010 and we believe that we will be in the top four for 2011 

other indemnity businesses 

our other indemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our net premiums written in each of the last three years consist of managing our runoff businesses including the runoff of our professional liability businesses which we sold in 2010 pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business we will continue to write these policies principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks for an agreed upon period after the closing of the sale from august 1 2009 through june 30 2010 the substantial majority of the business written for these policies was 100 reinsured beginning in july 2010 all such new and renewal business is 100 reinsured as of december 31 2011 we continued to write this business in only two states and will stop writing all of this business as of april 30 2012 the sale of these businesses did not have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

service businesses 

our service businesses which represent less than 1 of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our operations primarily include 

 

  

  

   

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 280 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 54 service centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide our concierge level claims service of which 7 have combined our claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency these service centers are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete we hold a us patent for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process which increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to other claims settlement processes this patent expires on june 5 2021 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional issuers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents over the last few years comparative rating services have gained prominence adding transparency to industry pricing and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts andor expanded their online service offerings these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin in addition california and florida treat certain progressive subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws 

state insurance laws impose numerous requirements conditions and limitations on the operations of insurance companies insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations regulated areas include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

  

insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2011 we had net premiums written of 151466 million and statutory surplus of 52692 million the combined premiumstosurplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 29 to 1 in addition as of december 31 2011 we had access to 20 billion in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business these reports include 

 

  

  

  

 state insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments certain investments are prohibited 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c herein for further information on these dividend limitations in december 2010 the naic promulgated a revised model holding company act which to the extent ultimately adopted by individual state legislatures will expand the scope of existing insurance holding company regulation 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

as mentioned above insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations including coverages forms rating criteria and rate levels the ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance 

  

departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information the use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue and it is possible that the us congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices allegations of discriminatory pricing underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act created a new federal insurance office which is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in addition to our us operations we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is offered solely through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission which regulates customer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority which regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing 

  

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

 investments 

our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 160 billion at december 31 2011 compared to 155 billion at december 31 2010 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 5826 million in 2011 compared to 6162 million in 2010 and 5341 million in 2009 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

  

employees 

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2011 was 25007 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on june 30 2011 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

 our reserves developed favorably in each of the last three years which is reflected as “incurred related to prior years” in the table above total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved the favorable reserve development for 2011 and 2010 for our personal lines business primarily personal auto and for the last three years for our commercial auto business reflected the settlement of larger losses for amounts less than we originally reserved during the last three years we also experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs reflecting a combination of fewer claims being litigated as well as the fact that a greater percentage of these cases are now being handled by our inhouse counsel which is a costeffective alternative to using external law firms in addition for 2010 our ibnr reserves developed favorably due to lower severity and frequency of late emerging claims however in 2011 the number of late emerging claims increased over 2010 and was greater than anticipated by our carried ibnr thus we recognized unfavorable development on our total ibnr reserves 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

  

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development 

millions 

  

    

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 2001 through 2010 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2011 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 34497 million of the currently estimated 34759 million of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2002 thus an estimated 262 million of losses incurred through 2002 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the “net cumulative development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 2001 liability has developed favorably by 697 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2003 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 9 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2011 but incurred in 2008 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2008 2009 and 2010 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

for 2001 while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity our developed reserves were within 25 of our original estimates our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year or about 4 to 9 of our original carried amounts the reserve development for 2006 and 2007 was less than 4 of our original carried reserves for both 2008 and 2009 we experienced favorable reserve development of more than 6 of our original estimates which reflects the decreases in severity we experienced in both our personal auto about 35 and commercial auto about 5 businesses through 2011 the favorable development of approximately 4 for 2010 also reflects lower severity estimates for both personal auto and commercial auto but to a lesser extent than the previous two years 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 10 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2010 we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be 7041 million during 2011 these reserves developed unfavorably by 476 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to 7517 million as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses this development primarily reflects our claims organization’s continuing process of reevaluating michigan personal injury protection claims that require lifetime reserve estimates as a result we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 10 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors tableend progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

  

  

  

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below these categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold inflation or deflation consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

 

 our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders  

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries thereby constraining our ability to write new business 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 9 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 30 2011 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms floods earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable moreover changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters 

the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event we use catastrophe modeling tools and thirdparty experts to help estimate our exposures to such events but those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions and may result in projections that prove to be inaccurate an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance cash flows and results of operations 

 

 we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information technology pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors 

  

our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses all of which are highly competitive businesses if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer or engage in other successful competitive initiatives our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised in addition due to our focus on the auto insurance market we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time for example if changing driving patterns rising gasoline prices advancements in vehicle technology or other factors were to result in decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies as a result of varying loss cost experiences and profitability goals the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted but which may or may not be favorable for progressive’s business prospects at that time in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophic fund we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders which could strain our service capabilities in the near term 

our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively respond to our competitors’ initiatives and efficiently manage complexity 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment these innovations may also require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk which makes their implementation a challenge in addition our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with or in reliance on third party vendors and their systems which may further limit our control of implementation quality customer experiences and successful outcomes our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry these developments can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technological advances or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies among other initiatives the growth in mobile communications and the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers are recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace where we are committing substantial resources our ability to react to such advances develop and maintain winning strategies and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success 

the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses combined with ongoing technological regulatory and other developments results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business the complexity may create barriers to implementing certain new ideas or providing highquality products and customer experiences and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources such as it resources for competing initiatives or projects our inability to manage this complexity effectively to bring new ideas to market to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources or to prevent errors could result in decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business poor customer experiences substantially increased costs liability to third parties regulatory investigations and sanctions and damage to our brand 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our 

  

current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company these situations might include among others failing to protect sensitive customer information systems failures effects of cyber attacks such as computer hacking data theft system disruption and viruses and malware errors in handling a customer’s policy inappropriate handling of claims of policyholders or other parties misconduct by our officers directors or employees or others acting on our behalf inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of thirdparty systems that we use facility shutdowns or other causes litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices and actions by our other business partners including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners insurance and other business partners and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop compensate and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships and brand could be materially adversely affected 

our success also depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may among other things limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in 

  

addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary for example in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” which among other provisions that could impact aspects of our operations created within the united states department of the treasury a new federal insurance office fio whose purpose is in part to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk if the fio were to recommend to the new financial stability oversight council also created by the doddfrank act that we are “systemically significant” and therefore require additional regulation or that the insurance industry as a whole should be regulated at the federal level our businesses could be affected significantly we are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge level claims services program our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness financial results prospects and liquidity 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges to our direct repair program and service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employmentrelated practices allegations of medical or attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of courtimposed regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12 – litigation in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors 

our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business and financial information these systems are subject to attacks by third parties including sophisticated individuals and groups with substantial computing resources and capabilities such attacks may include among other things attempts to gain unauthorized access to 

 

  

   

  

  

 similarly an employee consultant agent or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems and in the loss corruption or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees 

we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of thirdparty vendors which may provide software data storage and other computer services to us some of which may be referred to as “cloud computing” these thirdparty systems may experience similar cyber attacks and other security breaches along with the possible risk of loss or unauthorized publication of progressive’s information or the confidential information of our customers and employees these relationships present further risk management challenges for us including among others confirming and monitoring the thirdparty’s security measures the potential for improper handling of or access to our data and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate 

we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and the sensitive personal information of our customers and employees these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security assurance examples include physical security measures access and password policies firewalls systems monitoring malicious code protection network and hostbased intrusion detection and prevention measures data loss prevention measures configuration assurance data encryption and event management as well as third party intrusion vulnerability testing in addition we seek to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under “cloud computing” or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation security and financial due diligence contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards and ongoing testing auditing and evaluation of thirdparty compliance with the required standards while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 

our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party’s systems are adversely affected in addition such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us we have elected to selfinsure these risks at this time the occurrence of a security breach data loss or corruption or cyber attack if sufficiently severe could have a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments such as progressive must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information while the pci standards set a high bar for data security compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis in september 2011 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pci’s data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations our facilities and systems could become unavailable inoperable or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes including without limitation natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks computer security breaches or cyber attacks as discussed above riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of thirdparty vendors or unavailability of communications facilities likewise we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for various reasons including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 

the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such events could result in a 

  

deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill 

our business is also highly dependent on access to and the operation of the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

 

 the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index with a small portion actively managed by a separate investment advisory firm using a valueoriented investment approach our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 or that follows a specific investment discipline such as value investing does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio as discussed above for example a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall particularly those of interestsensitive companies in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as the financial services industry which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital likewise the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor including sector or industry concentrations lack of geographic diversification and the performance of individual issuers 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2011 and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

 

 our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial difficulties or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example contracts for the acquisition of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology facilities equipment and support and other systems and services that are integral to our operations agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks or other financial institutions if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repurchase its securities repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or other securities or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

  

  

   

 further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to meet regulatory requirements to support the growth of our insurance businesses to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends repurchase stock or other securities and fund corporate opportunities the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based in part on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by regulatory requirements and the performance of our insurance operations and investment results including investment income valuation changes in our portfolio and the realization of any deferred tax benefits as well as by our capital management activities such as the payment of cash dividends repurchases of our common shares and debt securities the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt equity or other securities if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties such as rating agencies underwriters institutional and other investors and our customers potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral in cash or highgrade assets for the benefit of the other party to the transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 3313 for 2011 and 2012 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to 

  

repeat the annual dividend in 2012 to be paid early in 2013 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2012 or early 2013 and the board retains the discretion at any time to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2012 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “investing risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares or debt securities 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm performance while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm results such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers or increases in advertising spend to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

progressive’s common shares 100 par value are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol pgr the high and low prices set forth below are as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system 

 

 the closing price of our common shares on february 15 2012 was 2134 

b holders 

we had 3273 shareholders of record on december 31 2011 

c dividends 

see the table above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends declared on our common shares 100 par value for the last two years 

progressive maintains a policy of declaring an annual variable dividend payable shortly after the close of the year the annual variable dividend is based on a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a target percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor known as our gainshare factor the board determined the target percentage of aftertax underwriting income to be 20 for 2009 25 for 2010 and 3313 for 2011 this target will remain at 3313 for 2012 the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives in our insurance businesses the gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is approved by the compensation committee of the board annually although recalibrated every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual variable dividend program is subject to certain limitations to the extent the gainshare factor is zero or if aftertax comprehensive income net income plus the aftertax change in unrealized gains losses during the period among other items is less than aftertax underwriting income no annual variable dividend will be paid 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined above the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2012 or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position in december 2011 the board of directors declared an annual dividend which was paid in february 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 26 2012 the amount of the dividend was 4072 per common share or 2494 million the 2010 annual dividend was declared by the board in december 2010 and paid to shareholders in february 2011 the total amount of dividends was 2638 million or 3987 per common share the 2009 annual dividend was declared by the board in december 2009 and paid to shareholders in february 2010 the total amount of dividends was 1084 million or 1613 per common share in addition in 2010 we returned 6632 million to shareholders via an extraordinary cash dividend of 100 per share 

  

consolidated statutory surplus was 53 billion on december 31 2011 and 51 billion on december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 4726 million of consolidated statutory surplus represented net admitted assets of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile generally the net admitted assets of insurance companies that subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed the companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile however which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements based on the dividend laws currently in effect the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of 11958 million in 2012 without prior approval from regulatory authorities provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 145 billion in 2010 compared to 140 billion in 2009 and 136 billion in 2008 our combined ratio calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 924 in 2010 916 in 2009 and 946 in 2008 

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado support our policy servicing agency distribution claims operations and direct sales 

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer chief human resource officer and chief marketing officer as well as our three group presidents discussed above the group presidents are responsible for the 

  

development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 90 of total net premiums written for each of the last three years our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers 

we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2009 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2010 there are approximately 360 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 14 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 18 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2009 the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1565 billion and our share of this market was approximately 78 compared to 1580 billion and 73 in 2008 respectively comparable industry data is not available for 2010 at this time all industry data including ranking and market share was obtained directly from data reported by either snl financial or am best company inc “am best” or was estimated using am best data as the primary source 

personal auto insurance represented approximately 90 of our total personal lines net premiums written for each of the last three years volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 4 of this report for further discussion 

our specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles atvs rvs mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items and represent about 10 of our personal lines business due to the nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 

the personal lines business is either generated by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone the agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states including brokerages in new york and california these independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with companymandated procedures our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of progressive to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other transactions or commitments the agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions and national agencies the total net premiums written through the agency business represented 58 of our personal lines volume in 2010 compared to 59 in 2009 and 62 in 2008 

the direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone the direct business represented 42 of our personal lines volume in 2010 compared to 41 in 2009 and 38 in 2008 

snapshot sm  our usagebased insurance product is now available to direct auto consumers in 27 states including 8 states added during 2010 and agency auto customers in 9 of those 27 states we plan to continue expansion of snapshot into about 15 additional states in 2011 depending on regulatory approval and business results we currently have three patents and additional patent applications pending with respect to usagebased insurance 

progressive home advantage ®  our offering which is designed to combine a progressive policy with a homeowner’s or renter’s policy underwritten by one of three unaffiliated insurance carriers is available to agency customers in 43 states and to direct customers in 48 states and the district of columbia this program is not available to customers in florida and alaska 

we also offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 32 states through certain independent agents and to direct customers via telephone we began offering this product in select markets in 2006 and have been expanding into additional markets as we have evaluated and met certain performance criteria we plan to continue the rollout in both channels during 2011 

commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 10 of our total net premiums written for each of the last three years the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the business auto and truck markets the business auto market which accounts for slightly more than half of our total commercial auto premiums and approximately 60 of the vehicles we 

  

insure in this business includes autos vans and pickup trucks used by small businesses such as contractors landscapers and plumbers the remainder is in the truck commercial auto market which includes dump trucks logging trucks tow trucks local cartage and other shorthaul commercial vehicles we also offer cargo general liability and workers’ compensation insurance products to these same customers certain of these products are underwritten by unaffiliated insurance companies through our progressive commercial advantage program although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

there are approximately 380 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with about 35 other large companiesgroups each with over 130 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial auto business ranked fourth in the commercial auto insurance market for 2009 and we believe that we will be in the top four for 2010 

other indemnity businesses 

our other indemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our net premiums written in each of the last three years consist of managing our runoff businesses which includes the runoff of our professional liability businesses principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks 

in 2010 we sold our professional liability insurance businesses pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business we will continue to write policies for an agreed upon period after the closing of the sale from august 1 2009 through june 30 2010 the substantial majority of the business written for these policies was 100 reinsured beginning in july 2010 all such new and renewal business is 100 reinsured the sale of these businesses did not have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

service businesses 

our service businesses provide insurancerelated services and represented less than 1 of our total revenues for each of the last three years and do not have a material effect on our overall operations 

our service business provides policy issuance and claims adjusting services for the commercial auto insurance proceduresplans caip which are statesupervised plans serving the involuntary market in 43 states we are the sole nationwide servicing carrier for caip as a service provider we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in 2010 we reached an agreement with aipso the national organization responsible for administering the involuntary insurance market under which we will receive a supplemental fee when necessary to satisfy a minimum servicing fee requirement we cede 100 of the premiums and losses to the plans reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business we have maintained and plan to continue to maintain compliance with these standards any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our service businesses also include our alliance with three unaffiliated homeowner insurance companies of which one company services our agency customers one services our direct customers and the third is available to both businesses through progressive home advantage ®  we offer either directly or through our network of independent agents new and existing progressive agency and direct customers home condo and renters insurance underwritten by these homeowner’s insurance companies for the policies written in our direct business we receive commissions which are used to mitigate the expenses associated with maintaining this program 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 320 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 54 service centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide our concierge level claims service these facilities are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete we hold a us patent for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process which increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to other claims settlement processes 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition and confidence coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional issuers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents over the last few years comparative rating services have gained prominence adding transparency to industry pricing and many of our competitors have 

  

significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts andor expanded their online service offerings these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets in which we operate 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative powers relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements regulating compliance with statutory accounting methods and the content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations in addition in some states the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and from time to time may investigate certain insurance company practices 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c herein for further information on these dividend limitations in december 2010 the national association of insurance commissioners naic promulgated a revised model holding company act which to the extent ultimately adopted by individual state legislatures will expand the scope of existing insurance holding company regulation 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2010 we had net premiums written of 144768 million and statutory surplus of 50730 million the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 29 to 1 in addition we have access to 22 billion in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed the naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of 

  

dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products while others result from consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting and rating insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in 2010 a new federal insurance office was created by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act whose purpose is to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information the use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue and it is possible that the us congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating 

we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is offered solely through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission regulates customer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing 

  

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

 investments 

our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 155 billion at december 31 2010 compared to 147 billion at december 31 2009 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income loss including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 6162 million in 2010 compared to 5341 million in 2009 and 8074 million in 2008 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

  

employees 

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2010 was 24638 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on june 30 2010 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

 our reserves developed favorably in both 2010 and 2009 compared to slight unfavorable development in 2008 total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives the favorable development in 2010 was primarily attributable to lower than expected defense and cost containment expenses and favorable settlement on larger losses in both personal auto and commercial auto similarly in 2009 personal auto experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs while commercial auto recognized favorable settlements on larger losses during the year in 2008 an increase in the number of late reported commercial auto claims and an increase in the estimated severity of these claims was a primary contributor to the unfavorable development 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

  

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development 

millions 

 

  

    

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 2000 through 2009 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2010 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 29706 million of the currently estimated 30009 million of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2001 thus an estimated 303 million of losses incurred through 2001 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 2000 liability has developed favorably by 981 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 2001 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2010 but incurred in 2007 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2007 2008 and 2009 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

for 2000 and 2001 while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity our developed reserves were within 2 to 4 of our original estimates the bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year or about 4 to 9 of our original carried amounts the reserve development for each of 2006 through 2008 was less than 4 of our original carried reserves while 2009 reserves developed favorably by about 5 due to lower than expected defense and cost containment expenses and favorable settlements on larger losses in our personal auto and commercial auto businesses 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 9 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2009 we estimated our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to be 5294 million during 2010 these reserves developed unfavorably by 1244 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to 6538 million as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses this development primarily reflects our claims organization’s process of reevaluating michigan personal injury protection claims that require lifetime reserve estimates which began in 2009 and continued in early 2010 as a result we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 9 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors tableend progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

  

  

  

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

it should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates the number of vehicles sold inflation or deflation market valuations interest rates consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially 

 

 our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets as a result our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries constraining our ability to write new business 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 30 2010 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event if they occur with enough severity our financial performance cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable in addition changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes other storms and fires we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposures to such events but those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that may provide projections that are materially different from the actual events as a result increased levels of hurricanes and other storms could have a material adverse effect on our insurance operating results 

 

 we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and strong marketing underwriting and pricing capabilities our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or 

  

offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information technology pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can further reduce profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted but which may or may not be favorable for progressive’s business prospects at that time in addition in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a statesponsored catastrophic fund we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders which could strain our service capabilities in the near term 

our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively respond to our competitors’ initiatives and efficiently manage complexity 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment these innovations may also require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and thus may add to our costs and entail a degree of complexity and risk that makes their implementation a challenge in addition our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals these initiatives may also disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry this can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technology advances or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies among other initiatives our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success 

the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses combined with ongoing technological regulatory and other developments results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business the complexity may create a barrier to implementing certain new ideas and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources such as it resources for multiple potential initiatives or projects our inability to manage this complexity effectively to bring new ideas to market to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources or to prevent errors could result in substantially increased costs liability to third parties regulatory investigations and sanctions poor customer experiences and damage to our brand 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company these situations might include among others failing to protect sensitive customer information systems failures effects of cyber attacks such as computer hacking data theft system disruption and viruses and malware errors in handling a customer’s policy inappropriate handling of 

  

claims of policyholders or other parties inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to systems failures facility shutdowns or other causes litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices and actions by our other business partners including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products such as homeowners insurance and other business partners and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships and brand could be materially adversely affected 

we further believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances including to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations or an alleged failure to so comply by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary for example in 2010 congress passed the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” which in addition to imposing a number of new compliance obligations on publicly traded companies created within the united states department of the treasury a new federal insurance office fio whose purpose is in part to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk if the fio were to recommend to the new financial stability 

  

oversight council also created by the doddfrank act that we are “systemically significant” and therefore require additional regulation or that the insurance industry as a whole should be regulated at the federal level our businesses could be affected significantly we are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge level claims services program our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness financial results prospects and liquidity 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us federal fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges to our direct repair program and service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employmentrelated practices allegations of medical or attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of courtimposed regulation resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12 – litigation in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations our facilities and systems could become unavailable inoperable or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes including without limitation natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks cyber attacks such as computer hacking data theft system disruption and viruses and malware riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages or interruptions of data processing and storage systems and communications facilities likewise we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for various reasons including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 

the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill 

  

our business is highly dependent on access to and the operation of the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

a security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations infect corrupt or destroy data or systems subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated and significantly damage our reputation despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses programming errors insider threats attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments satisfaction of the pci standards does not ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis but it is required to do business with the credit card companies in september 2010 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pci’s data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

 

 the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio which is managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio discussed above for example a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall particularly those of 

  

interestsensitive companies in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as the financial services industry which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2010 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

 

 our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial hardship or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements these include for example contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology facilities equipment and support and other systems and services that are integral to our operations agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks or other financial institutions if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts 

  

progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 further information on insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to support the growth of our insurance businesses to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends repurchase stock and fund corporate opportunities the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based in part on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process the amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face while our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investment results including investment income valuation changes in our portfolio and the realization of any deferred tax benefits as well as by our capital management activities such as the payment of cash dividends repurchases of our common shares and debt securities the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt equity or other securities if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties such as rating agencies underwriters institutional and other investors and our customers and as a result our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral in cash or highgrade assets for the benefit of the other party to the transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 25 for 2010 and 3313 for 

  

2011 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses to the extent our aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2011 to be paid early in 2012 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2011 or early 2012 and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2011 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “investing risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares or debt securities 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm position while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm performance such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers or increases in advertising spend to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

progressive’s common shares 100 par value are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol pgr the high and low prices set forth below are as reported on the consolidated transaction reporting system 

 

 the closing price of our common shares on february 15 2011 was 2016 

b holders 

there were 3703 shareholders of record on december 31 2010 

c dividends 

see the table above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends declared on our common shares 100 par value for the last two years 

progressive maintains a policy of declaring an annual variable dividend payable shortly after the close of the year the annual variable dividend is based on a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a target percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor known as our gainshare factor the board determined the target percentage of aftertax underwriting income to be 20 for 2008 and 2009 and 25 for 2010 the board increased this target to 3313 for 2011 the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives in our insurance businesses the gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is approved by the compensation committee of the board annually although recalibrated every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual variable dividend program is subject to certain limitations to the extent the gainshare factor is zero or if aftertax comprehensive income net income plus the aftertax change in unrealized gains losses during the period among other items is less than aftertax underwriting income no annual variable dividend will be paid 

although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2011 or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position in december 2010 the board of directors declared an annual dividend which was paid in february 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 27 2011 the amount of the dividend was 3987 per common share or 2638 million the 2009 annual dividend was declared by the board in december 2009 and paid to shareholders in february 2010 the total amount of dividends was 1084 million or 1613 per common share no dividend was paid for 2008 because we reported an aftertax comprehensive loss in addition in 2010 we returned 6632 million to shareholders via an extraordinary cash dividend of 100 per share 

  

to the extent we elect to defer the payment of interest on our 670 fixedtofloating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2067 we may be restricted from declaring any dividends see note 4 – debt in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for further discussion our intent is to pay interest on the debentures as and when due 

consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus was 51 billion on december 31 2010 and 50 billion on december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 4549 million of consolidated statutory policyholders’ surplus represented net admitted assets of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate that are required to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements in such entities’ states of domicile generally the net admitted assets of insurance companies that subject to other applicable insurance laws and regulations are available for transfer to the parent company cannot include the net admitted assets required to meet the minimum statutory surplus requirements of the states where the companies are licensed the companies may be licensed in states other than their states of domicile however which may have higher minimum statutory surplus requirements based on the dividend laws currently in effect the insurance subsidiaries could pay aggregate dividends of 9498 million in 2011 without prior approval from regulatory authorities provided the dividend payments are not made within 12 months of previous dividends paid by the applicable subsidiary

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 140 billion in 2009 compared to 136 billion in 2008 and 138 billion in 2007 our combined ratio calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 916 in 2009 946 in 2008 and 926 in 2007 

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our direct sales and customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado support our policy servicing agency distribution and claims operations 

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer and chief human resource officer as well as our three group presidents personal lines commercial lines and claims the group presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

  

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 89 of total net premiums written for 2009 and approximately 87 for both 2008 and 2007 our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers 

we ranked fourth in market share in the us private passenger auto market for 2008 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2009 there are approximately 370 competitors in this market progressive and the other leading 14 private passenger auto insurers each of which writes over 20 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2009 the estimated industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the united states was 1587 billion and our share of this market was approximately 76 compared to 1579 billion and 73 respectively in 2008 and 1591 billion and 73 in 2007 except as otherwise noted all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by am best company inc “am best” or were estimated using am best data as the primary source 

personal auto insurance represented approximately 90 of our total personal lines net premiums written for each of the last three years volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 4 of this report for further discussion 

our specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles atvs rvs mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items due to the nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 

the personal lines business is either generated by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone the agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states as well as brokerages in new york and california these independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with companymandated procedures our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of progressive to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other transactions or commitments the agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions and national agencies in 2009 the total net premiums written through the agency business represented 59 of our personal lines volume compared to 62 in 2008 and 63 in 2007 

the direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone net premiums written in the direct business were 41 38 and 37 of our personal lines volume in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

progressive home advantage ®  our offering which combines a progressive auto policy with a homeowner’s or renter’s policy underwritten by one of three unaffiliated insurance carriers is available to agency customers in 41 states and to direct customers in 48 states and the district of columbia this program is not available to direct customers in florida and alaska 

we also currently offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 30 states through certain independent agents and to direct business customers via telephone we began offering this product in select markets in 2006 and have been expanding into additional markets as we have evaluated and met certain performance criteria we plan to continue the rollout in both channels during 2010 

commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 11 of our total net premiums written for 2009 and approximately 13 for both 2008 and 2007 the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the business auto and specialty truck markets the business auto market which accounts for slightly more than half of our total commercial auto premiums and approximately 60 of the vehicles we insure in this business includes autos vans and pickup trucks used by artisans such as contractors landscapers and plumbers and a variety of other small businesses the remainder is in the specialty truck commercial auto market which includes dump trucks logging trucks tow trucks local cartage and other shorthaul commercial vehicles by the end of 2009 we substantially completed the rollout of our cargo and general liability insurance products which we introduced in 2007 although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service 

  

there are approximately 380 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with 32 other large companiesgroups each with over 160 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial auto business ranked fourth in the commercial auto insurance market for 2008 and we believe that we held that position for 2009 

other indemnity businesses 

our other indemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our net premiums written in each of the last three years primarily include writing professional liability insurance for community banks principally directors and officers liability insurance the program sponsored by the american bankers association aba insures over 1600 banks representing every state in addition our other indemnity businesses include managing our runoff businesses 

we have entered into an agreement to sell our community bank program to an aba affiliate the transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2010 as an interim measure effective august 1 2009 we began reinsuring 100 of this risk with another carrier prior to august 1 2009 we reinsured the majority of the risk on the professional liability insurance coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities the sale of this business will not have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

service businesses 

our service businesses provide insurancerelated services and represented less than 1 of our revenues for each of the last three years 

our principal service business is providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services for the commercial auto insurance proceduresplans caip which are statesupervised plans serving the involuntary market in 43 states we have previously competed with two other carriers for the majority of the caip market however both of these other carriers withdrew leaving us as the largest caip provider countrywide although our market share increased we did not realize an increase to revenues as the downturn in the caip market continues as a service provider we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies we cede 100 of the premiums and losses to the plans reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business we have maintained and plan to continue to maintain compliance with these standards any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our service businesses also include our alliance with three select homeowner insurance companies through progressive home advantage ®  we act as an agent to offer new and existing progressive customers home condo and renters insurance underwritten by these homeowner’s insurance companies commissions received from this business are used to mitigate the underwriting expenses associated with maintaining this program this program is available to our personal lines customers in 48 states and the district of columbia it is not currently available in alaska or florida 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 370 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 54 centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide our concierge level claims service these facilities are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop arrange the repair including pickup and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete we received a us patent in 2008 for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process which increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels and by smaller regional issuers in the agency channel some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents over the last few years comparative rating services have gained prominence adding transparency to industry pricing and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts andor expanded their online service offerings these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets 

  

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

state insurance licenses 

our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of florida indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative powers relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements regulating compliance with statutory accounting methods and the content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c herein for further information on these dividend limitations 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2009 the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 28 to 1 in addition we have access to 22 billion in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance 

  

department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products while others result from consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate of return limitations and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy insurance availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit information also at the direction of congress the federal trade commission studied the effects of the use of credit information on the availability and affordability of insurance and the extent to which credit information impacted the availability and affordability of insurance by geography income ethnicity and race the use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue and it is possible that the us congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use in underwriting and rating 

we began writing personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in australia through a branch of one of our us insurance subsidiaries this insurance is offered solely through the internet we do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in australia there are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in australia the australian securities and investment commission regulates customer disclosures and the australian prudential regulatory authority regulates solvency both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction issue regulations take enforcement actions and in general have broad regulatory powers progressive direct insurance company has been issued licenses by both agencies 

  

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

 investments 

our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 147 billion at december 31 2009 compared to 130 billion at december 31 2008 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors total investment income loss including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 5341 million in 2009 compared to 8074 million in 2008 and 7871 million in 2007 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

  

employees 

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2009 was 24661 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on june 25 2009 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

 our objective is to establish case and ibnr reserves that are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the date that the reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed our reserves developed favorably in 2009 compared to unfavorable development in both 2008 and 2007 total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives in 2009 the favorable development was primarily related to lower than expected defense and cost containment reserves and favorable settlements on larger losses in our commercial auto business in 2008 an increase in the number of late reported commercial auto claims and an increase in the estimated severity on these claims was a primary contributor to the unfavorable development the unfavorable development in 2007 was due to the settlement of some large outstanding litigation the number of large losses emerging from prior accident years being more than anticipated plus the result of reviews of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

  

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development 

millions 

 

 

 

    

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 1999 through 2008 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross and net basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2009 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 26546 million of the currently estimated 26835 million of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 2000 thus an estimated 289 million of losses incurred through 2000 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 1999 liability has developed unfavorably by 865 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 2000 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2009 but incurred in 2006 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2006 2007 and 2008 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

from 1999 through 2001 while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity our developed reserves were within 4 of our original estimates the bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year or about 4 to 10 of our original carried amounts the reserve development for each of 2006 through 2008 was less than 3 of our original carried reserves 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 9 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2008 we estimated our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to be 2445 million during 2009 these reserves developed unfavorably by 2741 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to 5186 million as shown at the bottom of the table over the last ten years we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses this development primarily reflects our claims organization reevaluating michigan personal injury protection claims that require lifetime reserve estimates as a result we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables since these claims are reinsured through the michigan catastrophic claims association mcca statemandated plan the mcca is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state therefore our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 9 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors tableend progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

  

  

  

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

it should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates sales of new vehicles inflation or deflation stock market valuations interest rates consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially 

i insurance risks 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses and inflation trends among other factors for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets as a result our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our volume and competitiveness in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries constraining our ability to write new business 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 25 2009 

our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots and hazardous material releases the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event when they occur with enough severity our financial performance cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable in addition changing climate conditions may increase the frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes other storms and fires and we will continue to monitor and assess scientific information relating to such developments we use catastrophe modeling tools to help manage our exposures to such events but those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that may provide projections that are materially different from the actual events as a result increased levels of hurricanes and other storms could have a material and adverse effect on our insurance operating results 

ii operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national and international companies as well as smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and sophisticated marketing underwriting and pricing strategies our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or 

  

offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information technology pricing scale and cost control are major competitive factors 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can further reduce profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition or in the failure of one or more competitors the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted but which may or may not be favorable for progressive’s business prospects at that time on the other hand in the event of a failure of a major insurer we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders which could strain our service capabilities in the near term 

our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively respond to our competitors’ initiatives and efficiently manage complexity 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and these changes must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment as such our innovations may entail a degree of complexity and risk that makes their implementation a challenge and our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in addition these initiatives may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry this can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technology advances or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies among other initiatives our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success 

the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses combined with ongoing technological regulatory and other developments results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business the complexity in turn leads to the increased possibility of error in executing business strategies as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources such as it resources for multiple potential initiatives or projects our inability to manage this complexity effectively to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources or to prevent errors could result in substantially increased costs liability to third parties regulatory investigations and sanctions poor customer experiences and damage to our brand 

we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers 

it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly significant given the importance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors our business could be materially adversely affected 

our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company these situations might include among others failing to protect sensitive customer information errors in handling a customer’s policy inappropriate handling of claims of policyholders or other parties inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to systems failures facility shutdowns or other causes litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices and actions by unrelated businesses that we have introduced to our customers to provide insurance products that we do not offer and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors 

  

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results customer relationships and brand could be materially adversely affected 

we further believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states the district of columbia and beginning in december 2009 australia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

most jurisdictions impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold in addition laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances including to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in governmentprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations or an alleged failure to so comply by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

  

our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately 

we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our conciergelevel claims services program our failure to pay claims fairly accurately and in a timely manner or to deploy claims resources appropriately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our competitiveness financial results prospects and liquidity 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the us federal fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures challenges to our direct repair program and service center program interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employmentrelated practices allegations of medical or attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields a new layer of courtimposed regulation could emerge resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12 – litigation in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions including our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted manner necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations our facilities and systems could become unavailable inoperable or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes including without limitation natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages or interruptions of data processing and storage systems and communications facilities likewise we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for various reasons including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded 

the shutdown or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill 

our business is highly dependent on access to and the performance of the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

  

a security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations infect corrupt or destroy data or systems subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated and significantly damage our reputation despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses programming errors insider threats attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments satisfaction of the pci standards does not ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis but it is required to do business with the credit card companies in september 2009 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pci’s data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

iii market risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if among other factors there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete information or prove unwarranted or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions 

the common equity portfolio which is managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio discussed above for example a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall particularly those of interestsensitive companies in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as the financial services industry which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio when such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital 

  

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to suffer a decrease in value due to market sector or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2009 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

iv credit risks 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent experience other financial hardship or default in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service relationships these include for example contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology facilities equipment and support and other systems and services that are integral to our operations private labeling arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial transactions such as derivative instruments with major banks or other financial institutions if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

   

  

  

 further information on insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” of this report 

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to support the growth of our insurance businesses to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends repurchase stock and fund corporate opportunities the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based in part on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management the amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face while our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investment results including investment income valuation changes in our portfolio and the realization of any deferred tax benefits as well as by our capital management activities such as the payment of cash dividends repurchases of our common shares the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt equity or other securities if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time our financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties such as rating agencies underwriters institutional and other investors and our customers and as a result our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on the substantial recovery to original cost for our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets ability to enter into new financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service fitch ratings and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral in cash or highgrade assets for the benefit of the other party to the transaction downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 20 for 2009 and 25 for 2010 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses to the extent our aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be payable in 2008 this calculation resulted in no dividend being paid to shareholders while for 2009 we paid a dividend of 1613 per share in february 2010 

  

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2010 to be paid early in 2011 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until late 2010 or early 2011 and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2010 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in us federal income tax laws or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “investing risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our common shares or debt securities 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm position while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm performance such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers or increases in advertising spend to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities

c dividends 

see the table above for the frequency and amount of cash dividends paid on our common shares 100 par value for the last two years 

progressive maintains a policy of paying an annual variable dividend that if declared would be payable shortly after the close of the year the annual variable dividend is based on a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a target percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor known as our gainshare factor for 2008 and 2009 the board determined the target percentage of aftertax underwriting income to be 20 the board increased this target to 25 for 2010 the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives the gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is approved by the compensation committee of the board annually although recalibrated every year the structure of the gainsharing program generally remains the same our annual variable dividend program is subject to certain limitations to the extent the gainshare factor is zero or if aftertax comprehensive income net income plus the aftertax change in unrealized gains losses during the period among other items is less than aftertax underwriting income no annual variable dividend will be paid in addition although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2010 or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position in december 2009 the board of directors declared an annual dividend which was paid on february 5 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 27 2010 the amount of the dividend was 01613 per common share or an estimated 1085 million in aggregate however no dividend was paid for 2008 because we reported an aftertax comprehensive loss

 item 1 business tableend a general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has 58 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services throughout the united states our propertycasualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our noninsurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 10  segment information in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 136 billion in 2008 compared to 138 billion in 2007 and 141 billion in 2006 our combined ratio calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 946 in 2008 926 in 2007 and 867 in 2006 

organization 

we write private passenger auto insurance and the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states we began writing auto and boat insurance in massachusetts during 2008 we also write private passenger auto in the district of columbia we write commercial auto policies in 49 states we do not currently write commercial auto in hawaii or the district of columbia 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

 our direct sales and customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado support our underwriting and claims operations 

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief marketing officer chief information officer and chief human resource officer as well as our three group presidents personal lines commercial lines and claims the group presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

  

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for approximately 87 of total net premiums written for each of the last three years our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full line of auto insurance products with superior service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers 

we ranked fourth in industry market share for 2007 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2008 there are approximately 360 competitors in the total private passenger auto market progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto insurers each of whom write over 2 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2008 the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the united states was 1599 billion and our share of this market was approximately 72 compared to 1591 billion and 73 respectively in 2007 and 1602 billion and 74 in 2006 except as otherwise noted all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by am best company inc “am best” or were estimated using am best data as the primary source 

private passenger automobile insurance represented approximately 90 of our total personal lines net premiums written for the last three years volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 4 of this report for further discussion 

our specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles recreational vehicles mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items due to the nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 

the personal lines business is generated either by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone the agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states as well as brokerages in new york and california these independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with companymandated procedures our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of progressive to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other transactions or commitments the agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions and national agencies in 2008 the total net premiums written through the agency business represented 62 of our personal lines volume compared to 63 in 2007 and 64 in 2006 

the direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone net premiums written in the direct business were 38 37 and 36 of our personal lines volume in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

we also currently offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 24 states through certain independent agents and to direct business customers via telephone we began offering this product in select markets in 2006 and have been expanding into additional markets as we have evaluated and met certain performance criteria we plan to continue the rollout in both channels during 2009 

progressive home advantage our offering which combines a progressive auto policy with a homeowner’s or renter’s policy underwritten by homesite insurance expanded in 2008 we provide this option to customers in 46 states for direct buyers and in 33 states for agency customers in 2009 we plan to make this offering available through additional agents 

commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 13 of our total net premiums written for each of the last three years the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the specialty truck and business auto markets the specialty truck commercial auto market which accounts for slightly more than half of our total commercial auto premiums and approximately 40 of the vehicles we insure in this business includes dump trucks logging trucks tow trucks local cartage and other shorthaul commercial vehicles the remainder is in the business auto market which includes autos vans and pickup trucks used by artisans such as contractors landscapers and plumbers and a variety of other small businesses in 2007 we introduced cargo and general liability insurance in select markets with further state expansion in 2008 although 

  

the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service there are approximately 360 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with 33 other large companiesgroups each with over 190 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial auto business ranked third in the commercial auto insurance market for 2007 and we believe that we could rank third or possibly fourth for 2008 

other indemnity businesses 

our other indemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our net premiums written in each of the last three years primarily include writing professional liability insurance for community banks principally directors and officers liability insurance we reinsure the majority of the risk on these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities the program sponsored by the american bankers association insures over 1700 banks representing every state in addition our other indemnity businesses include managing our runoff businesses 

service businesses 

our service businesses provide insurancerelated services and represented less than 1 of our revenues in each of the last three years our principal service business is providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services for the commercial auto insurance proceduresplans caip which are statesupervised plans serving the involuntary market the decrease in service business revenues reflects the continuing cyclical downturn in the involuntary commercial auto market we have previously competed with two other carriers for the majority of the caip market however one of these other carriers ceased writing new business in the second quarter 2008 and the remaining carrier recently announced that it will cease writing new business in early 2009 this will leave us as the largest caip provider countrywide although we expect that our market share will be increasing we may not realize an immediate effect to revenues as the cyclical downturn in the caip market continues in addition we do not expect any increase in revenues to be material to our financial results as a service provider we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies we cede 100 of the premiums and losses to the state plans reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business we have maintained and plan to continue to maintain compliance with these standards any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 460 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 54 centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide our concierge level claims service these facilities are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop arrange the repair including pick up and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete we received a us patent in 2008 for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process which increases consumer satisfaction increases our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs concierge level of claims service is our primary approach to damage assessment and coordination of vehicle repairs at authorized auto repair facilities in these markets 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers over the last few years comparative rating services have gained prominence adding transparency to industry pricing and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts andor expanded their online service offerings these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

  

state insurance licenses 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of florida indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative powers relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements regulating compliance with statutory accounting methods and the content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval 

insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c herein for further information on these dividend limitations 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2008 the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 30 to 1 in addition we have access to 10 billion in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

  

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate of return limitations rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit also at the direction of congress the federal trade commission studied the effects of the use of credit information on the availability and affordability of insurance and the extent to which credit information impacted the availability and affordability of insurance by geography income ethnicity and race as a result of this study it is possible that congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating 

  

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

 investments 

our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 130 billion at december 31 2008 compared to 142 billion at december 31 2007 investment income loss is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors investment income loss including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 8074 million in 2008 compared to 7871 million in 2007 and 6381 million in 2006 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

  

employees 

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2008 was 25929 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known adjustments if any relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on june 30 2008 as well as in section “v critical accounting policies” of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

 our objective is to establish case and ibnr reserves that are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the date that the reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed our reserves developed unfavorably in both 2008 and 2007 compared to favorable development in 2006 total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves based on regularly scheduled reviews claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives in 2008 an increase in the number of late reported commercial auto claims and an increase in the estimated severity on these claims was a primary contributor to the unfavorable development the unfavorable development in 2007 was due to the settlement of some large outstanding litigation the number of large losses emerging from prior accident years being more than anticipated plus the result of reviews of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims the favorable development in 2006 reflected the recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions claims resolution practices and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

  

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development 

millions 

 

  

  the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 1998 through 2007 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated 

  

liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2008 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 226 billion of the currently estimated 229 billion of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 1999 thus an estimated 296 million of losses incurred through 1999 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 1998 liability has developed favorably by 186 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 1999 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2008 but incurred in 2005 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2005 2006 and 2007 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

from 1998 through 2001 while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity our developed reserves were within 100 million each year or 4 of our original estimates the bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005 thus the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable following the end of each year or about 4 to 10 of our original carried amounts during 2007 and 2008 the 2006 and 2007 yearend reserves experienced unfavorable development as higher than anticipated severity estimates were realized in 2008 the estimated severity for the two most recent prior accident years 2007 and 2006 both increased less than 10 for personal auto and increased 39 and 10 respectively for commercial auto for older accident years the changes in estimated severity were generally downward 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 9 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses each year the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2007 we estimated our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to be 2875 million during 2008 these reserves developed unfavorably by 338 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to 3213 million as shown at the bottom of the table 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 9 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors tableend progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

  

  

 although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities similarly while setting insurance rates establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

it should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control issues such as unemployment rates sales of new vehicles inflation or deflation stock market valuations interest rates consumer confidence and construction spending among a host of other factors will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses in addition other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares could decline materially 

 

 we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies have substantial resources experienced management and sophisticated marketing underwriting and pricing strategies our business focuses on insurance for personal automobiles and recreation vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry in which brand recognition operational effectiveness including for example rate and claimpaying accuracy customer experience and application of information technology pricing and cost control are major competitive factors 

historically the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers this price competition which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs such as vehicle repair costs medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims can further decrease profits or result in underwriting losses as the insurers recognize this situation which can occur at different times for different companies the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates sometimes referred to as a “hard market” in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels as more insurers react in this way profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates starting the cycle over again in the past this cycle has generally played out over a number of years we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business and these changes must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment as such our innovations may entail a degree of complexity and risk that 

  

makes their implementation a challenge and our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in addition these initiatives may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical however to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position if we fail to do so our business could be materially adversely affected 

at the same time innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry this can include product pricing or marketing innovations new or improved services technology advances or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies among other initiatives our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success 

we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors our business could be materially adversely affected we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market 

the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major insurer we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under statemandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with a variety of backgrounds and experiences could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected 

we further believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us other judicial decisions legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances or prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders in addition laws in certain states mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances including to pay claims upon the insolvency of 

  

other insurance companies or to cover losses in stateprovided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often results in increased costs which can be substantial to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

in addition the innovative strategies that we pursue in our efforts to compete may deviate from standard practices in the industry these innovations often involve significant complexity and as a result can be a challenge to implement requiring us to effectively deploy our management and other resources this may create the potential for errors or inaccuracies in our implementation of the strategy if we are alleged to have damaged or otherwise disadvantaged consumers competitors or other industry participants as a result we could be subject to regulatory or other official investigations and sanctions as well as litigation from third parties 

the failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations or the alleged failure to so comply by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ total loss evaluation methodology use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employmentrelated practices allegations of medical and attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields a new layer of courtimposed regulation could emerge resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 12—litigation in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses loss adjustment expenses underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

  

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets as a result our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our volume and competitiveness in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries constraining our ability to write new business 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 30 2008 

likewise we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent claims the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our conciergelevel claims services program our failure to pay claims fairly and accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our financial results prospects and liquidity 

  

our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event in addition our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of such an event most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity our financial performance cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions including our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims and other obligations a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for any reason including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity as well as damage to customer goodwill 

our business is highly dependent on access to and the performance of the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis disruptions in financial markets or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems could limit our ability to meet payment obligations a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments 

a security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations infect corrupt or destroy data or systems subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated and significantly damage our reputation despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the pci security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments in september 2008 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pci’s data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

 

 the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks 

our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixedincome securities and common equities our fixedincome portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes shortterm investments fixedmaturity securities and preferred stocks the performance of the fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixedincome portfolio may vary depending on the market environment the fixedincome portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if there is a lack of transparency regarding the businesses of issuers of securities that we purchase if credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete information or prove unwarranted or if our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions among other factors 

the common equity portfolio which is managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold an investment that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies equity markets sectors industries and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility and may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixedincome portfolio discussed above for example a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall particularly those of interestsensitive companies in addition even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors such as the financial services industry which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio when such a sector underperforms a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio 

both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to be impaired by market sector or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2008 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

iii financing risks 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” herein 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year or no payment in some years and the dividend program ultimately may be changed 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors 20 for each of 2008 and 2009 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses to the extent our aftertax comprehensive income which includes net investment income realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be payable for 2008 this calculation resulted in no dividend being paid to shareholders 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2009 to be paid early in 2010 the dividend if any would not be declared by the board until december 2009 and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2009 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “investing risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our stock 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent experiences other financial hardship or defaults in the performance of contractual obligations 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships these include for example contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support and other services that are integral to our operations private labeling arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies in addition from time to time we enter into significant financial instruments such as derivative transactions with major banks or other financial institutions if one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses operational problems and brand risk which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our reputation 

  

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to support the growth of our insurance businesses and to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based in part on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management the amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face while our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain 

the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investing results including investment income valuation changes in our portfolio and the realization of any deferred tax benefits as well as by our capital management activities such as the payment of cash dividends repurchases of our common shares the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt equity or other securities if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio our capital levels may be reduced perhaps significantly if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time our financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties such as rating agencies underwriters and institutional and other investors and as a result our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted and the price of our common shares could fall significantly 

in addition the recoverability of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on substantial recovery to original cost for our fixedincome securities and redeemable preferred stocks should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary which would reduce our capital levels 

our access to capital markets our ability to enter into new financing arrangements obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s moody’s investors service and am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired in addition a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post collateral in amounts then owed to the other party in cash or high grade assets downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in any such event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in our stock price 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm position while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm performance such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price

during 2006 progressive’s board of directors approved a plan to replace our previous quarterly dividend policy with an annual variable dividend beginning in 2007 the annual variable dividend is based on a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a target percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor known as our gainshare factor for 2007 2008 and 2009 the board determined the target percentage of aftertax underwriting income to be 20 the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives the gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is approved by the compensation committee of the board annually to the extent the gainshare factor was zero or if comprehensive income which includes net investment income as well as both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses during the period was less than aftertax underwriting income no annual variable dividend would be paid in addition although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2009 or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position based on our 2008 results our aftertax comprehensive loss was less than aftertax underwriting income therefore the board of directors determined that no dividend would be paid for 2008 

in june 2007 the board declared an extraordinary dividend of 200 per common share the extraordinary dividend was part of a plan to restructure our capital position during the year and is described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k

 item 1 business 

a general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has 65 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services throughout the united states our propertycasualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our noninsurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 9 — segment information  beginning on page appa22 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 138 billion in 2007 compared to 141 billion in 2006 and 140 billion in 2005 our combined ratio calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 926 in 2007 867 in 2006 and 881 in 2005 

organization 

we write private passenger auto insurance and the majority of our special lines products in 49 states we expect to begin writing private passenger auto in massachusetts during the second quarter 2008 and special lines later in the year we also write private passenger auto in the district of columbia we write commercial auto policies in 49 states we do not currently write commercial auto in hawaii or the district of columbia 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because among other factors traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these local differences we are organized as follows 

 

 

our customer service groups located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado support our underwriting and claims operations 

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer and chief human resource officer as well as our three group presidents personal lines commercial lines and claims the group presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines business accounted for 87 of total net premiums written in 2007 compared to 86 in 2006 and 87 in 2005 our strategy is to be the lowcost provider of a full line of auto insurance products with superior service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers 

we ranked third in industry market share for 2006 based on net premiums written and believe that we are in a virtual tie for third for 2007 there are approximately 370 competitors in the total private passenger auto market progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto insurers each of whom write over 2 billion of premiums comprise about 75 of this market for 2007 the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the united states was 1608 billion and our share of this market was approximately 72 compared to 1602 billion and 74 respectively in 2006 and 1596 billion and 75 in 2005 except as otherwise noted all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by am best company inc “am best” or were estimated using am best data as the primary source 

private passenger automobile insurance represented 90 of our total personal lines net premiums written in 2007 compared to 91 in 2006 and 92 in 2005 volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition service quality and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion 

our specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles recreational vehicles mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items due to the nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market and that we have been the market share leader for personal watercraft insurance since 2002 and for the motorcycle product since 1998 

we also started offering a personal umbrella insurance product in select markets in 2006 this product was expanded in 2007 and is currently being offered through certain independent agents in 13 states and to direct business customers in three states we plan to continue to expand this product to an additional 12 states for the agency business in 2008 we will continue to evaluate the customer service experience through the direct channel before determining to what extent and how to expand this product offering to additional markets during 2008 

the personal lines business is generated either by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone the agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states as well as brokerages in new york and california these independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with companymandated procedures our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of progressive to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other 

transactions or commitments the agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions and national agencies in 2007 the total net premiums written through the agency business represented 63 of our personal lines volume compared to 64 in 2006 and 66 in 2005 

the direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone net premiums written in the direct business were 37 36 and 34 of our personal lines volume in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 13 of our total net premiums written in 2007 compared to 14 in 2006 and 13 in 2005 the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the specialty truck and business auto markets the specialty truck commercial auto market which accounts for slightly more than half of the total commercial auto premiums and approximately 40 of the vehicles we insure in this business includes dump trucks logging trucks tow trucks local cartage and other shorthaul commercial vehicles the remainder is in the business auto market which includes autos vans and pickup trucks used by artisans such as contractors landscapers and plumbers and a variety of other small businesses in 2007 we introduced cargo and general liability insurance in select markets with further state expansion in 2008 although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service there are approximately 370 competitors in the total commercial auto market we primarily compete with approximately 30 other large companiesgroups each with over 200 million of commercial auto premiums written annually these leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75 of this market our commercial auto business ranked third in the commercial auto insurance market for 2006 and we believe that we held that position for 2007 

other indemnity businesses 

our other indemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our 2007 2006 and 2005 net premiums written include providing professional liability insurance to community banks principally directors and officers liability insurance we reinsure the majority of the risk on these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities the program sponsored by the american bankers association insures over 1700 banks representing every state in addition our other indemnity businesses include managing our runoff businesses 

service businesses 

our service businesses include providing insurancerelated services primarily policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 27 states for commercial auto insurance proceduresplans caip which are statesupervised plans serving the involuntary markets we process approximately half of the premiums in the caip market and compete with two other providers countrywide one of these other carriers has indicated that it will cease writing new business in 2008 and we expect our market share of this business will increase as a result as a service provider we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies we cede 100 of the premiums and losses to the plans reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business we have maintained and plan to continue to maintain compliance with these standards any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the service businesses represented less than 1 of our 2007 2006 and 2005 revenues 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 475 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 54 centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide our concierge level claims service these facilities are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop arrange the repair including pick up and delivery of the vehicle and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are 

complete this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction increases our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs concierge level of claims service is our primary approach to damage assessment and coordination of vehicle repairs at authorized auto repair facilities in these markets we expect to construct 5 new centers in 2008 and 2009 of which 3 centers will replace existing leased facilities we are pleased to report that on january 29 2008 we received a us patent for our unique conciergelevel method of managing the vehicle repair process 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered and other product features claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers over the last few years third party comparative rating services have gained prominence adding transparency to industry pricing and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts andor expanded their online service offerings these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

state insurance licenses 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of florida indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval to mandated rates 

insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their 

affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c for further information on these dividend limitations 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus generally 3 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business at yearend 2007 the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 30 to 1 although we have access to 21 billion in a noninsurance subsidiary portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate of return limitations rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state 

insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit also at the direction of congress the federal trade commission studied the effects of the use of credit information on the availability and affordability of insurance and the extent to which credit information impacted the availability and affordability of insurance by geography income ethnicity and race as a result of this study it is possible that congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating 

in some states the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators legislators or special interest groups to reduce freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to underlying costs including initiatives to roll back automobile and other personal lines rates automobile insurers have also been subject to legislative and regulatory actions designed to limit their ability to manage effectively the cost of motor vehicle repairs these kinds of activities have affected adversely and in the future may affect adversely the profitability and growth of our subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately or to manage the cost of motor vehicle repairs or that could affect the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways may occur in the future the impact of these legislative or regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted 

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

 

investments 

we employ a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 142 billion at december 31 2007 compared to 147 billion at december 31 2006 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 7871 million in 2007 compared to 6381 million in 2006 and 4988 million in 2005 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page appa30 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

employees 

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2007 was 26851 all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known such adjustments if any are reflected in the current results of operations a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on june 28 2007 as well as in the “critical accounting policies” section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page appa53 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for 2007 2006 and 2005 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

during 2007 we experienced 803 million of unfavorable loss reserve development compared to favorable development of 2469 million and 3559 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the unfavorable development in 2007 was due to settlement of some large outstanding litigation the number of large losses emerging from prior accident years being more than anticipated plus the result of reviews of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims the favorable development in 2006 and 2005 was driven by actuarial adjustments resulting from regularly scheduled actuarial reviews as well as favorable “all other development” eg claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claims representatives the favorable “all other development” also reflected the continued recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated we conduct extensive reviews each month on portions of our business to help ensure that we are meeting our objective of having reserves that are adequate with minimal variation 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written these severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development millions 

 

 

 the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 1997 through 2006 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the 

estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the reestimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2007 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 190 billion of the currently estimated 193 billion of losses and lae that had been unpaid at the end of 1998 thus an estimated 282 million of losses incurred through 1998 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 1997 liability has developed favorably by 1867 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 1998 the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 9 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2007 but incurred in 2004 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2004 2005 and 2006 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

we experienced significant favorable reserve development through the mid1990’s until 1997 primarily due to decreasing bodily injury severity while the carried reserves anticipated an increasing severity from 1998 through 2001 we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity and as a result saw our reserve development much closer to our original estimates the bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2006 as a result the reserve runoff for these years was very favorable in 2007 the realization of higher prior years’ severity than anticipated resulted in our reserves developing unfavorably by 15 not only did this development impact 2006 but also impacted the runoff of most of the past yearend reserves in 2007 the estimated severity for accident years 2005 and 2006 was higher than our estimated severity at the end of 2006 by 10 and 7 respectively for our personal auto products and by 40 and 77 for our commercial auto products 

although the detail is not presented in the table on page 10 we also reestimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses we had at the end of the calendar year while the bottom shows the reserves reestimated based on development in subsequent years for example at december 31 2006 we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be 3614 million during 2007 these reserves developed unfavorably by 37 million bringing the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to 3651 million as shown at the bottom of the table 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 10 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors 

progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities similarly while setting insurance rates establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares could decline materially 

i operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies may have greater financial marketing and management resources than we have in addition competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives 

in recent years the highly competitive nature of the automobile insurance industry has been evidenced in part by declining premium rates for many consumers including our own recent rate reductions among other factors these price decreases have been driven primarily by decreasing frequency trends ie less accidents per insurance policy which have not been fully offset by increases in severity ie amounts paid per accident this very competitive environment has in turn resulted in lower operating income and revenue growth rates for us we cannot predict whether these trends will continue but if they do our growth rates at a 96 combined ratio may become pressured 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business as such our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in addition these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers if we are unable successfully to develop plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive regulatory and legal environments or if we are unable to identify effective strategies in the first instance to maintain or enhance our competitive position our business could be materially adversely affected 

similarly we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors our business could be materially adversely affected we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the recent increases in advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market 

the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major insurer we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under statemandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected 

we further believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the 

use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances in addition compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the failure to comply with these laws and regulations or the alleged failure to so comply by us or other companies in the insurance financial services or related industries also could result in actions or investigations by regulators state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials for example in recent years several states have included us in document and information requests relating to investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents allegations of bid rigging by certain brokers and related matters although we have not been notified that we are the target of any such investigation such actions and investigations and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation could potentially lead to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations and such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of aftermarket parts total loss evaluation methodology use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims other claims handling procedures interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employmentrelated practices medical malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on our subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields a new layer of courtimposed regulation could emerge resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 

litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information 

on pending litigation see note 11 — litigation  beginning on page appa24 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data and the projection of future accident trends loss costs and expenses for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets as a result our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

the realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our volume and competitiveness in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries constraining our ability to write new business 

our growth trends have been and could continue to be impacted by reduced accident frequency trends 

auto accident frequency has steadily declined since 2000 although not conclusive several contributors to reduced frequency include improved vehicle safety road design and driver education as well as the increased price of gasoline which along with other factors may affect consumers’ driving habits these frequency trends have led us and most competitors to lower our insurance premiums which in turn has adversely impacted our recent premium growth rates we are not able to predict whether frequency will continue to decline stabilize or return to increasing trends more consistent with the periods prior to 2000 if the recent trend continues however declining auto accident frequency if not offset by an increase in severity could continue to pressure premium growth rates and potentially lead to a longterm reduction in the amount of premiums written in the auto insurance industry thus directly affecting our ability to grow our auto insurance business revenues 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

 

as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 28 2007 

likewise we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training experience and skill of our claims representatives the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our conciergelevel claims services program our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our financial results prospects and liquidity 

our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event in addition our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of such an event most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms as evidenced recently by the active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity our financial performance cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions including our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for any reason including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated and significantly damage our reputation despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the pci security standards council pci an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments at year end 2007 an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards the pci data security standards however will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes our intention is to maintain compliance with pci’s data security standards the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments 

ii investing risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment risks 

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

the common equity portfolio which is managed to track the russell 1000 index is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio 

in addition both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local national or international events such as power outages system failures wars or terrorist attacks recessions or depressions a significant change in inflation expectations a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit currencies or financial markets or other factors or events 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to be impaired by market sector or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page appa30 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k for additional discussion on current market risk associated with our investment portfolio 

iii financing risks 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” beginning on page 21 of this report 

the progressive corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year and the dividend program may ultimately be changed 

we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors for each of 2007 and 2008 at 20 and then by the gainshare factor determined under our employee gainsharing cash bonus plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses to the extent our comprehensive income which includes net investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses is less than aftertax underwriting income no dividend will be payable for 2007 this calculation resulted in a dividend payment of 145 per share which was paid on january 31 2008 

because the dividend calculation is performancebased the amount if any to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary perhaps significantly from the amounts paid in the preceding years as a result the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations in addition although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2008 to be paid early in 2009 the dividend will not be declared by the board until december 2008 and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2008 or future years such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “investing risks” any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of or the total return of an investment in our stock 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships these include for example contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support and other services that are integral to our operations joint marketing arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies if one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations and damage to our reputation 

if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to support the growth of our insurance businesses and to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses the level of capital that is retained at any time is determined by management based in part on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects and estimates of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management the amount of capital that we maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting investing and operating risks including those discussed in these risk factors the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face while our techniques for our capital needs are continually enhanced our ability to predict accurately the nature size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time our financial condition could be materially adversely affected our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found and our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted 

our access to capital markets our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s aa moody’s investors service aa2 and am best a with one company rated a progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in either event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend paid under our annual variable dividend policy we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in our stock price 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm position while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm performance such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price

during 2006 progressive’s board of directors approved a plan to replace our previous quarterly dividend policy with an annual variable dividend beginning in 2007 the annual variable dividend will be based on a formula that multiplies our annual aftertax underwriting income by a target percentage factor and then by a companywide performance factor known as our gainshare factor for 2007 and 2008 the board determined the target percentage of aftertax underwriting income to be 20 the gainshare factor can range from zero to two and is determined by comparing operating performance for the year to certain predetermined profitability and growth objectives the gainshare factor is also used in connection with our cash bonus program for employees and is approved by the compensation committee of the board annually to the extent the gainshare factor was zero or if comprehensive income which includes net investment income as well as both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses during the period was less than aftertax underwriting income no annual variable dividend would be paid in addition although it is our intent to calculate an annual dividend based on the formula outlined the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2008 or future years at any time prior to the declaration of the dividend for the year such an action by the board could result from among other reasons changes in the insurance marketplace changes in our performance or capital needs changes in federal income tax laws disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our business liquidity or financial position in 2007 the board declared a dividend of 1450 per common share 

in june 2007 the board also declared an extraordinary cash dividend of 200 per common share the extraordinary dividend was part of a plan to restructure our capital position during the year and is described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page appa30 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k

a general development of business 

the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 currently has 67 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services throughout the united states our propertycasualty insurance products protect our customers against collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles uninsured and underinsured bodily injury and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles our noninsurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations 

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 9 segment information  beginning on page appa21 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 141 billion in 2006 compared to 140 billion in 2005 and 134 billion in 2004 our combined ratio calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 867 in 2006 881 in 2005 and 851 in 2004 

organization 

we write private passenger auto insurance policies in 49 states all except massachusetts and the district of columbia auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community to respond to these differences in our personal lines product management areas these 50 jurisdictions are organized into three geographical regions there are two general managers in each region one to handle the business written through independent agents and one to handle the business written directly our commercial auto business is organized by product on a national basis with statelevel product managers responsible for local implementation in addition to service our customers countrywide the claims business area is organized into six geographical regions with a general manager each responsible for a different region all of our business area general managers report directly to the group presidents discussed below our business written through independent agents has its own customer service units our business written directly has sales and customer service units both businesses share claims loss reporting units that take initial claims reporting calls from customers these customer service groups are located at call centers in mayfield village ohio austin texas tampa florida sacramento california tempe arizona and colorado springs colorado 

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer and chief human resource officer as well as our four group presidents agency direct commercial auto and 

claims the group presidents are challenged to develop and manage product offerings and customer service processes tailored to the unique requirements of customers who select our insurance products buying policies through the distribution channel of their choice 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreational and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group the personal lines businesses accounted for 86 of total net premiums written in 2006 compared to 87 in 2005 and 88 in 2004 our strategy is to be the lowcost provider of a full line of auto insurance products with superior service distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers 

we ranked third in industry market share for 2005 based on net premiums written and believe that we held this position for 2006 we compete with approximately 280 other insurance companiesgroups that each writes over 5 million of private passenger auto insurance premiums annually in the united states the top 15 private passenger auto insurers comprised about 75 of this market for 2006 the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the united states was 1611 billion and our share of this market was approximately 76 compared to 1595 billion and 76 respectively in 2005 and 1573 billion and 75 in 2004 except as otherwise noted all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by am best company inc “am best” or were estimated using am best data as the primary source 

private passenger automobile insurance represented 91 of total personal lines net premiums written by progressive in 2006 compared to 92 in both 2005 and 2004 our objective is to offer an accurate rate for virtually all drivers volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion 

our specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles recreational vehicles mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items these products represented 9 of the total personal lines net premiums written and are primarily distributed by independent agents and brokers due to the nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market based on our review of the markets we have determined that we have been the market share leader for personal watercraft insurance since 2002 and for the motorcycle product since 1998 

we also started offering a personal umbrella insurance product in select markets in 2006 this pilot program is currently being offered through certain independent agents to existing agency business customers in five states the pilot program will continue to be evaluated against certain performance criteria before a decision is made as to whether to expand this product offering to additional markets 

the personal lines business is generated either by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone the agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states as well as brokerages in new york and california these independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with companymandated procedures our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of progressive to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other transactions or commitments the agency business also writes business through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions and national brokerage agencies in 2006 the total net premiums written through the agency business represented 64 of our personal lines volume compared to 66 in 2005 and 68 in 2004 

the direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone net premiums written in the direct business were 36 34 and 32 of our personal lines volume in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

commercial auto 

the commercial auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 14 of our total net premiums written in 2006 compared to 13 in 2005 and 12 in 2004 the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles the commercial auto business which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel operates in the specialty truck and light and local commercial auto markets the specialty truck commercial auto market which accounts for slightly more than half of the total commercial auto premiums and approximately 40 of the vehicles we insure in this business includes dump trucks logging trucks tow trucks local cartage and other shorthaul commercial vehicles the remainder is in the light and local commercial auto market which includes autos vans and pickup trucks used by artisans such as contractors landscapers and plumbers and a variety of other small businesses although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service we compete on a countrywide basis with approximately 210 other companiesgroups each with over 5 million of commercial auto premiums written annually our commercial auto business ranked third in market share on a national basis in 2005 based on direct written premiums and we believe that we are in a virtual tie with the other two companies as coleaders in the commercial auto insurance market for 2006 

other indemnity businesses 

our other indemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our 2006 2005 and 2004 net premiums written include providing professional liability insurance to community banks principally directors and officers liability insurance we reinsure the majority of the risk on these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities the program sponsored by the american bankers association insures over 1700 banks representing every state in addition our other indemnity businesses include managing our runoff businesses 

service businesses 

our service businesses include providing insurancerelated services primarily policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for commercial auto insurance proceduresplans caip which are statesupervised plans serving the involuntary markets we process approximately 50 of the premiums in the caip market and compete with two other providers countrywide as a service provider we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies we cede 100 of the premiums and losses to the plans reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business we have maintained and plan to continue to maintain compliance with these standards any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the service businesses represented less than 1 of our 2006 2005 and 2004 revenues 

our service business also includes our total loss concierge program this program is primarily a customerservice initiative through which we help policyholders and claimants find and purchase a replacement vehicle when their automobile is declared to be a total loss 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 475 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 53 centers in 41 metropolitan areas across the country that provide conciergelevel claims service these facilities are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites where they can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete this service reforms the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction increases our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs conciergelevel of claims service is our primary approach to damage assessment and facilitation of vehicle repairs in urban markets we will continue to expand this service into 2007 and 2008 although at a slower pace with approximately 18 new sites expected to be opened 

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers over the last few years third party comparative rating services have emerged adding transparency to industry pricing and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts andor expanded their online service offerings further intensifying the competitive nature of the automobile and other propertycasualty insurance markets 

we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

state insurance licenses 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of florida indiana louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval to mandated rates 

insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c for further information on these dividend limitations 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and 

the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings progressive is in the process of slowly increasing operating leverage through a higher ratio of net premiums written to surplus in our insurance subsidiaries where permitted although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus generally 3 to 1 at yearend 2006 the combined premiums to surplus ratio for all progressive insurance companies was 28 to 1 thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks progressive’s rbc ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation regulatory measures and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate of return limitations rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit also congress recently mandated that the federal government conduct a disparate impact study of the use of credit it is possible that congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating following completion of that study 

in some states the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators legislators or special interest groups to reduce freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to underlying 

costs including initiatives to roll back automobile and other personal lines rates this kind of activity has affected adversely and in the future may affect adversely the profitability and growth of our subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately or affecting the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways may occur in the future the impact of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted 

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities certain significant differences are described below 

 

investments 

we employ a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a fair value of 147 billion at december 31 2006 compared to 143 billion at december 31 2005 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 6381 million in 2006 compared to 4988 million in 2005 and 5637 million in 2004 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial

the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2006 was 27778 all of which were employed by subsidiaries of the progressive corporation 

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves or “ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known such adjustments if any are reflected in the current results of operations a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form 8k on june 28 2006 as well as in the “critical accounting policies” section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page appa44 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the accompanying tables present information concerning our propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for 2006 2005 and 2004 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses millions 

 

during 2006 2005 and 2004 we experienced 2469 million 3559 million and 1091 million respectively of favorable loss reserve development the favorable development was driven by actuarial adjustments resulting from regularly scheduled actuarial reviews as well as favorable “all other development” eg claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claims representatives the favorable “all other development” also reflected the continued recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated we conduct extensive reviews each month on portions of our business to help ensure that we are meeting our objective of having reserves that are adequate with minimal variation 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account projected changes in average severities of claims which are caused by the anticipated effect of inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written average severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in 

underwriting standards inflation policy provisions and general economic trends these anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development millions 

 

 

 the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 1996 through 2005 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on 

experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2006 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 16505 million of the currently estimated 16755 million of losses and lae that had been incurred through the end of 1997 thus an estimated 250 million of losses incurred through 1997 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years for example the 1996 liability has developed favorably by 893 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on the income of any one year the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 1999 but incurred in 1996 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 1996 1997 and 1998 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

we experienced continually favorable reserve development from 1996 through 1998 primarily due to decreasing bodily injury severity the reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the current accident year’s severity would increase over the prior accident year’s estimate from 1996 continuously through the third quarter 1998 our bodily injury severity decreased each quarter when compared to the same quarter of the prior year this period of decreasing severity for us was not only longer than that experienced by the industry but also longer than at any time in our recent history as the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates the realization of the decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development late in 1998 we started experiencing an increase in bodily injury severity as a result the reserve development for 1998 through 2001 has been much closer to our original estimate thereafter we recognized lower severity than what we expected when reserves were originally set resulting again in favorable development from 2002 through 2005 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 10 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors 

progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

 

in addition a fourth category of other risks is included below to highlight additional matters that our shareholders should consider to better understand management’s longterm approach to the business 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities similarly while setting insurance rates setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any such risks or uncertainties or any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares could decline materially 

i operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future many of these companies may have greater financial marketing and management resources than we have in addition competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business as such our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in addition these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers if we are unable successfully to develop plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive regulatory and legal environments or if we are unable to identify effective strategies in the first instance to maintain or enhance our competitive position our business could be materially adversely affected 

similarly we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors our business could be materially adversely affected we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the recent increases in advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market 

the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major insurer we could be adversely affected as our company 

and other insurance companies may be required under statemandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs andor employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we further believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances in addition compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

the failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or other law enforcement officials potentially leading to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

during 2004 and 2005 we received document and information requests from several state attorneys general and insurance regulators regarding investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents allegations of bidrigging by certain brokers and other related matters we have not been notified by any governmental or regulatory authority that we are the target of any such investigation for a discussion of these 

requests see the “financial condition — commitments and contingencies” section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report which is attached as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices and those of our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations and such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of aftermarket parts total loss evaluation methodology use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against us concerning how we settle claims our employmentrelated practices medical malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from the operation of our business in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on the subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields a new layer of courtimposed regulation could emerge resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business such litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 11 litigation beginning on page appa23 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

 

the realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our volume and competitiveness in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries constraining our ability to write new business 

our longterm growth prospects could be impacted by reduced accident frequency trends 

auto accident frequency has steadily declined since 2000 contributing to lower insurance premiums for many consumers although not conclusive several contributors to reduced frequency include improved vehicle safety road design and driver education we are not able to predict whether frequency will continue to decline will stabilize or will return to increasing trends more consistent with the periods prior to 2000 if the recent trend continues however declining auto accident frequency if not offset by an increase in severity could lead to a longterm reduction in the amount of premiums written in the auto insurance industry thus directly affecting our ability to grow our auto insurance business revenues 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 28 2006 

likewise we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training and experience of our claims representatives the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management our ability to develop or select and implement 

appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our conciergelevel claims services program our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our financial results prospects and liquidity 

our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 

catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event in addition our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of such an event most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms as evidenced recently by the active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity our financial performance cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions including our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems for any reason including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation in addition we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

ii investing risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment risks 

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

the common equity portfolio which is managed to track the russell 1000 index is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio 

in addition both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local national or international events such as power outages system failures wars or terrorist attacks recessions or depressions a significant change in inflation expectations a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit currencies or financial markets or other factors or events 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to be impaired by market sector or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

iii financing risks 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

 

 

 

further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” on page 20 of this report 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships including without limitation contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support and other services that are integral to our operations and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies if one or more of these parties were 

to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations 

our decision to retain a specific amount of capital that is not adequate to support our actual business needs could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to grow 

we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses to provide for the anticipated growth of our insurance businesses and to provide for additional protection against possible large unexpected losses the level of capital that is retained at any time is determined by management based in part on current and anticipated business results our growth prospects and estimates of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face if our actual capital level turns out to be lower than is actually needed at a given time our financial condition could be materially adversely affected our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found and our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted 

our access to capital markets our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service in addition the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries is rated by am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in either event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected 

iv other risks 

we do not manage to shortterm earnings expectations our goal is to maximize the longterm value of the enterprise which at times may adversely affect shortterm results 

we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year we do not manage our business to maximize shortterm stock performance or the amount of the dividend paid under our annual variable dividend policy we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result our reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in our stock price 

in addition due to our focus on the longterm value of the enterprise we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longerterm position while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit shortterm performance such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share such strategies for example may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers consequently these strategies may adversely affect shortterm performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings 

none for a discussion of litigation we currently face see note 11 litigation  beginning on page appa23 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

on february 22 2007 a jury in the federal district court in oklahoma city oklahoma rendered a verdict in the amount of 61 million against one of our subsidiaries in an individual employmentrelated case brought under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 all actions under title vii are subject to a statutory cap on compensatory and punitive damages of 300000 excluding damages for front pay back pay and attorneys fees which were not covered by the jury’s verdict and will be decided separately by the court we therefore believe that the jury’s determination is contrary to law and also believe that the verdict was not supported by the facts presented to the court we will pursue available remedies to have the verdict overturned or reduced to an amount in conformance with the statutory cap and we believe that any liability in this case will not materially impact our financial condition cash flows or results or operations

b financial information about segments 

incorporated by reference from note 9 segment information  beginning on page appa19 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

c narrative description of business 

we offer a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 140 billion in 2005 compared to 134 billion in 2004 and 119 billion in 2003 our combined ratio calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap was 881 in 2005 851 in 2004 and 873 in 2003 

organization 

auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community our organization enables us to meet varied local conditions under a cohesive set of policies and procedures designed to provide consistency and control our business is organized into four areas drive ® insurance from progressive our agency brand which includes both personal and commercial auto progressive direct sm  claims and sales and service each business area has a group president and a management team we entered new jersey during 2005 and now write auto insurance policies in 49 states all but massachusetts and the district of columbia these 50 jurisdictions are organized into regions depending on business area the drive business is organized into drive marketing and drive sales in turn each is organized into three geographical regions with general managers the direct business is organized into three geographical regions with a general manager responsible for each region the claims business area has six general managers responsible for one region each sales and service which includes drive and direct customer service direct sales and claims loss reporting among other services is performed at locations in the following cities austin texas cleveland ohio colorado springs colorado phoenix arizona sacramento california and tampa florida 

our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer and 

 2  

chief human resource officer as well as our four group presidents drive direct claims and sales and service the group presidents are challenged to develop and manage product offerings and customer service processes tailored to the unique requirements of customers who select either drive or direct insurance products buying policies through the distribution channel of their choice 

personal lines 

our personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation and other vehicles this business generally offers more than one program in a single state with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel market or customer group personal lines accounted for 87 of total net premiums written in 2005 compared to 88 for both 2004 and 2003 our strategy is to become the lowcost provider of a full line of auto insurance products and related services distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers 

we ranked third in industry market share for 2004 based on net premiums written and we believe that we held this position for 2005 we compete with approximately 290 insurance companiesgroups that each writes over 5 million of private passenger auto insurance premiums annually in the united states the top 15 private passenger auto insurers comprised about 75 of this market our estimate of the 2005 industry net premiums written growth is 10 based on actual written premium growth through the first nine months of the year for 2005 the estimated industry net premiums written for personal auto insurance in the united states were 1589 billion and our share of this market was approximately 77 compared to 1573 billion and 75 respectively in 2004 and 1510 billion and 70 in 2003 except as otherwise noted all industry data and our market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by am best company inc “am best” or were estimated using am best data as the primary source 

private passenger automobile insurance is comprised of preferred standard and nonstandard automobile risks and represented 92 of total personal lines net premiums written by progressive in 2005 and 2004 compared to 93 in 2003 we actively participate in the market for each of these risks with the objective of offering an accurate rate for every risk volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness brand recognition and the actions of our competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion 

our specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles recreational vehicles mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items these specialty products represented the balance of our total personal lines net premiums written and are primarily distributed by independent agents and brokers due to the nature of these products we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months our competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on our analysis of this market we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market based on our review of the markets we have determined that we have been the market share leader for personal watercraft insurance since 2002 and for the motorcycle product since 1998 

the personal lines business is generated either through the drive channel or written directly by us through the direct channel the drive channel includes business written by our network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states as well as brokerages in new york and california these independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with certain companymandated procedures our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of progressive to establish underwriting guidelines develop rates settle or adjust claims or enter into other transactions or commitments the drive channel also writes business through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies financial institutions employers and national brokerage agencies in 2005 the total net premiums written through the drive channel represented 66 of our personal lines volume compared to 68 in 2004 and 69 in 2003 

 3  

the direct channel includes business written directly by us over the phone at 1800progressive and online at progressivedirectcom net premiums written in the direct business were 34 32 and 31 of our personal lines volume in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

commercial auto business 

the commercial auto business unit writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 13 of our total net premiums written in 2005 compared to 12 in 2004 and 11 in 2003 the majority of our commercial auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto in its customer bases and products written both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service our commercial auto products are distributed primarily through our drive brand in the independent agency channel we compete on a nationwide basis with approximately 200 other companiesgroups each with over 5 million of commercial auto premiums written annually our commercial auto business ranked third in market share on a national basis in 2004 based on direct written premiums and we estimate that we retained that position for 2005 

otherindemnity businesses 

our otherindemnity businesses which represented less than 1 of our 2005 and 2004 net premiums written compared to 1 for 2003 include providing professional liability insurance to community banks principally directors and officers liability insurance we reinsure the majority of the risk on these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities the program sponsored by the american bankers association insures over 1600 banks representing every state in addition our otherindemnity businesses include managing the winddown of our lender’s collateral protection program which we ceased writing in 2003 and other runoff businesses 

service businesses 

our service businesses include providing insurancerelated services primarily providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services in 25 states for commercial auto insurance proceduresplans caip which are statesupervised plans serving the involuntary markets we process over 47 of the premiums in the caip market and compete with two other providers nationwide as a service provider we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related policies we cede 100 of the premiums and losses to the plans reimbursements to us from the caip plans are required by state laws and regulations material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business we have maintained and plan to continue to maintain compliance with these standards any changes in our participation as a caip service provider would not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the service businesses represented less than 1 of our 2005 2004 and 2003 revenues 

claims 

we manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through more than 460 claims offices located throughout the united states in addition we have in operation 26 centers in 22 metropolitan areas nationwide that provide conciergelevel claims service these facilities are designed to provide endtoend resolution for auto physical damage losses customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites and can pick up a rental vehicle our representatives will then write the estimate select a qualified repair shop and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete this service reforms the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction increases our productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs 

in 2004 we achieved the performance standards that had been established for the expansion of our concierge claims strategy and as a result have announced a significant expansion of this service and are currently researching acquiring and constructing additional sites around the country we expect to add about 30 sites in 2006 including 18 currently under construction we have also expanded this concierge level of service by helping customers find and buy a replacement vehicle when their vehicle is deemed a total loss this service is being tested in limited locations but we expect expansion in 2006 

 4  

competitive factors 

the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers we rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential we have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies superior customer service fair and accurate claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy 

state insurance licenses 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our subsidiaries in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing 

insurance regulation 

progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of arizona florida louisiana michigan new jersey new york ohio texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to “file and use” to prior approval to mandated rates 

insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 

insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “dividends” discussion in item 5c for further information on these dividend limitations 

under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 

insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings progressive is in the process of slowly increasing operating leverage through a higher ratio of net premiums written to surplus in our insurance subsidiaries where permitted although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including applicable law the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves and the quality of the insurer’s assets the annual net  5  

premiums that an insurer may write are generally limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus eg at yearend 2005 our premiums to surplus ratio was 3to1 thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus in certain cases may limit its ability to grow its business the national association of insurance commissioners naic also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks 

many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses 

regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 

in a number of states progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act fcra and our data demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit also congress recently mandated that the federal government conduct a disparate impact study of the use of credit it is possible that congress may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating following completion of that study 

in some states the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators legislators or special interest groups to reduce freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to underlying costs including initiatives to roll back automobile and other personal lines rates this kind of activity has affected adversely and in the future may affect adversely the profitability and growth of our subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately or affecting the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways may occur in the future the impact of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted

statutory accounting principles 

our results are reported in accordance with gaap which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities primarily under gaap 

 

investments 

we employ a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that we can profitably write our portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities our investment portfolio had a market value of 143 billion at december 31 2005 compared to 131 billion at december 31 2004 investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in yield and other factors investment income including net realized gains losses on securities before expenses and taxes was 4988 million in 2005 compared to 5637 million in 2004 and 4780 million in 2003 for more detailed discussion see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning on page appa26 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses 

the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries our objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves“ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known such adjustments if any are reflected in the current results of operations a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices can be found in our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 28 2005 the accompanying tables present an analysis of propertycasualty losses and lae 

the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for 2005 2004 and 2003 on a gaap basis 

reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 

 

during 2005 and 2004 we experienced 3559 million 1091 million and 561 million respectively of favorable loss reserve development the favorable development during 2005 and 2004 was driven by actuarial adjustments resulting from regularly scheduled actuarial reviews as well as favorable “all other development” eg claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claims representatives the favorable “all other development” also reflected the continued recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated in addition to favorable claims development during 2003 we benefited from a change in our estimate of our future operating losses due to business assigned from the new york automobile insurance plan we conduct extensive reviews each month on portions of our business to help ensure that we are meeting our objective of having reserves that are adequate with minimal variation 

in establishing loss reserves we take into account the projected change in average severities of claims which is caused by the anticipated effect of inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written future average severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions and general economic trends these anticipated trends are monitored based on actual development and are modified if necessary 

we have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves

analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development 

 

 

  9  

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 1995 through 2004 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses 

the upper section of the table labeled “paid cumulative as of” shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table labeled “liability reestimated as of” shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2005 our insurance subsidiaries had paid 14179 million of the currently estimated 14432 million of losses and lae that had been incurred through the end of 1996 thus an estimated 253 million of losses incurred through 1996 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date 

the cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1995 liability has developed favorably by 1675 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on the income of any one year the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae 

in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 1998 but incurred in 1995 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 1995 1996 and 1997 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table 

we experienced continually favorable reserve development from 1995 through 1998 primarily due to decreasing bodily injury severity the reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the current accident year’s severity would increase over the prior accident year’s estimate from 1995 continuously through the third quarter 1998 our bodily injury severity decreased each quarter when compared to the same quarter of the prior year this period of decreasing severity for us was not only longer than that experienced by the industry but also longer than at any time in our recent history as the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates the realization of the decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development late in 1998 we started experiencing an increase in bodily injury severity as a result the reserve development for 1998 through 2001 has been much closer to our original estimate thereafter we recognized lower severity than what we expected when reserves were originally set 

the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 9 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of progressive’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments

 item 1a risk factors 

progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect the ability to achieve our business objectives 

 

although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities similarly while setting insurance rates setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed 

this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time 

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the market price of our common shares could decline materially 

i operating risks 

we compete in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive 

we face vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may also enter these markets in the future many of these companies may have greater financial marketing and management resources than we have in addition competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services which we do not offer we could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives 

from time to time we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from our andor our competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business as such our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in addition these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers ie agents and brokers if we are unable successfully to develop  11  

plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive regulatory and legal environments our business could be materially adversely affected 

similarly we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition and generate growth if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors our business could be materially adversely affected 

the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major insurer we could be adversely affected as our company and other insurance companies may be required under statemandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders 

our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to our success 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

in addition we must forecast the changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs andor employment levels accordingly our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect our cost structure or understaffing impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we further believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that it has developed over the years our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins 

progressive and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations 

progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers our subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success 

certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances in addition compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions 

 12  

the failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or other law enforcement officials potentially leading to fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition progressive and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 

during 2005 we received document and information requests from several state attorneys general and insurance regulators regarding ongoing investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents allegations of bidrigging by certain brokers and other related matters for a discussion of our responses to these requests see the “financial condition – commitments and contingencies” section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report which is attached as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses 

state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for the progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report 

lawsuits challenging our business practices our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future 

the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of aftermarket parts total loss evaluation methodology the use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our business practices or systems violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against progressive andor its subsidiaries or disputes may arise in the future concerning these or other business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against our competitors and other businesses and although we are not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on the subsidiaries’ business operations 

lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields a new layer of courtimposed regulation could emerge resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business such litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us we are unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business operations profitability or financial condition for further information on pending litigation see note 11 litigation beginning on page appa21 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k 

our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 

our financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 

 

 13  

 

the realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result we could underprice risks which would negatively affect our margins or we could overprice risks which could reduce our volume and competitiveness in either event our operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses 

we continue to be exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes as shown by the active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires or other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases medical epidemics utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event in addition our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of such an event most of our past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity our financial performance cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately 

our financial statements include loss reserves which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including 

 

 14  

 

as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report as well as our “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 28 2005 

likewise we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately including the training and experience of our claims representatives the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our conciergelevel claims services program our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and as a result materially adversely affect our financial results prospects and liquidity 

our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities systems and business functions including our information technology and other business systems 

our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in addition because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a thirdparty system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results prospects and liquidity 

a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation in addition we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

ii investing risks 

the performance of our fixedincome and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment risks 

our fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including 

 

 15  

 

the common equity portfolio which is managed to track the russell 1000 index is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio 

in addition both the fixedincome and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local national or international events such as power outages system failures wars or terrorist attacks recessions or depressions a significant change in inflation expectations a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit currencies or financial markets or other factors or events 

if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to be impaired by market sector or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree our liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances our income from these investments could be materially reduced and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms our business could be materially adversely affected 

iii financing risks 

our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates 

the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations repurchase its common shares or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors 

 

further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “dividends” on page 19 of this report 

our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship 

our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships including without limitation contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support and other services that are integral to our operations and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies if one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system product or service that is significant to our business we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance cash flows or results of operations 

 16  

our access to capital markets our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 

our credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service in addition the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries is rated by am best progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected perceptions of our company by investors producers other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in either event our financial performance could be materially adversely affected

risk factors the company’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect the company’s achievement of its business objectives  in addition a separate “other risks” category has been added at the end of this discussion for certain risks to investors that are not included in one of the three categories identified by management although in the discussion below the company has organized risks generally according to these categories it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category for example although presented as an operating risk below state regulation of insurance companies may also affect the company’s investing and financing activities similarly while setting insurance rates setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well the categories therefore should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing the company and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the company’s business if any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in that case the market price of the company’s common shares could decline materially i operating risks the company competes in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive the company faces vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may also enter these markets in the future many of these companies may have greater financial marketing and management resources than the company in addition competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services which the company does not offer the company could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives the company from time to time undertakes strategic initiatives to maintain and improve its competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from the company’s andor its competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business as such the company’s innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in 5 

addition these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt the company’s relationships with certain of its customers and producers ie agents and brokers if the company is unable successfully to develop plan and implement its strategic initiatives in these competitive regulatory and legal environments its business could be materially adversely affected similarly the company undertakes distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition and generate growth if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors the company’s business could be materially adversely affected the highly competitive nature of the markets in which the company competes could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major competitor the company could be adversely affected as the company and other insurance companies may be required under statemandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and as the company would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders the ability of the company to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to the company’s success the company’s success depends on its ability to attract develop and retain talented employees including executives and other key managers the company’s loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business in addition the company must forecast the changing business environments for multiple business units and in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust its hiring programs andor employment levels accordingly the company’s failure to recognize the need for such adjustments or its failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis could lead either to overstaffing which would adversely affect the company’s cost structure or understaffing impairing the company’s ability to service its ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations in either such event the company’s financial results could be materially adversely affected the company further believes that its success depends in large part on its ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that it has developed over the years the company’s ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against the company legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of the company’s workers could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of the company’s operating performance and margins the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations the company’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment the company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses including insurers the subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to the company’s success certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner the company’s compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable business or exit unprofitable markets in addition compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to the company’s insurance subsidiaries these costs in turn may adversely affect the company’s profitability or its ability or desire to grow its business in the applicable jurisdictions 6 

the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in actions by regulators or other law enforcement officials fines and penalties adverse publicity and damage to the company’s reputation in the marketplace and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the company and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations during 2004 the company received document and information requests from several state attorneys general and insurance regulators regarding ongoing investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents allegations of bidrigging by certain brokers and other related matters for a discussion of the company’s responses to these requests see the “financial condition – commitments and contingencies” section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report which is attached as exhibit 13 to this form 10k moreover new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect the company’s operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the company is unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect the company’s businesses state insurance regulation may create risk and uncertainties for the company’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 12 of this report lawsuits challenging business practices of the company its competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of aftermarket parts total loss evaluation methodology the use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act the methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical payment claims and policy implementation and renewal procedures among other matters from time to time the company also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that its business practices violate the patent trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties additional litigation may be filed against the company andor its subsidiaries or disputes may arise in the future concerning these or other business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against the company’s competitors and other businesses and although the company is not a party to such litigation the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on the subsidiaries’ business operations lawsuits against the company often seek significant monetary damages moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields a new layer of courtimposed regulation could emerge resulting in material increases in the company’s costs of doing business such litigation is inherently unpredictable except to the extent the company has established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against it the company is unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or future lawsuits may have on the business operations profitability or financial condition of the company for further information on pending litigation see note 11 litigation beginning on page appb21 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the company’s success depends on its ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on the company’s ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit the company’s ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation 7 

 such risks may result in the company’s pricing being based on stale inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result the company could underprice risks which would negatively affect the company’s margins or it could overprice risks which could reduce the company’s volume and competitiveness in either event the company’s operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected the company’s financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses the company continues to be exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires and other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the company’s total insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event in addition the company’s business could be further impaired if a significant portion of its business or systems were shut down by or if the company were unable to gain access to certain of its facilities as a result of such an event most of the company’s past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity the company’s financial performance cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected the company’s success depends on its ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately the company’s financial statements include loss reserves which represent the company’s best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which can arise from a number of factors including  8 

 as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on the company’s loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 15 of this report as well as the company’s “report on loss reserving practices” which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 29 2004 likewise the company must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under its policies many factors can affect the company’s ability to pay claims accurately including the training and experience of the company’s claims representatives the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management the company’s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support its claims functions and other factors the company’s failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to the company lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and the company’s reputation in the marketplace and impair the company’s brand image and as a result materially adversely affect the company’s financial results and liquidity the company’s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of its facilities systems and business functions including its information technology and other business systems the company’s business is highly dependent upon its employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of the company’s facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of the company’s information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in addition because the company’s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems the company could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third party system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the company’s ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary corporate functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on the company’s business results and liquidity a security breach of the company’s computer systems could also interrupt or damage its operations or harm its reputation in addition the company could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from its computer systems despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of the company’s computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any wellpublicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the company’s systems which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business ii investing risks the performance of the company’s fixedincome and equity investment portfolios are subject to investment risks the company’s fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including     9

business the company could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems which could in turn adversely affect the company’s financial performance cash flows or results of operations the company’s access to capital markets its financing arrangements and its business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies the company’s credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies such as standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service in addition the financial strength of the company’s insurance subsidiaries is rated by am best the company and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable stable ratings downgrades in the company’s credit ratings could adversely affect the company’s ability to access the capital markets andor lead to increased borrowing costs in the future although the interest rates paid by the company on current indebtedness would not be affected perceptions of the company by investors agents and consumers could also be significantly impaired downgrades in the ratings of the company’s insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact the company’s operations potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth in either event the company’s financial performance could be materially adversely affected iv other risks the company does not manage analysts’ or investors’ earnings expectations and the company announces its financial results on a monthly basis which may result in stock price volatility the company believes that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if the company meets or exceeds certain financial goals and policies established by the company the company does not manage its business to maximize shortterm stock performance the company does not provide earnings estimates to the market and does not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result the company’s reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the company’s stock price the company publicly announces its financial results on a monthly basis in addition to the quarterly and annual public filings required by law the company believes that this level of reporting provides more timely disclosure to shareholders and potential investors enabling them to enhance their understanding of the company’s performance such reports however may disclose variation of results that investors might not see in quarterly reports consequently investor reaction to such variation could result in significant volatility in the company’s stock price similarly under applicable accounting rules the company may be required to record a significant loss or other adjustment to income in a specific monthly reporting period in the event of a significant reserve adjustment catastrophic loss developments in litigation against the company otherthantemporary impairment writedown of one or more investments or other extraordinary events in addition the change in market value of certain derivative instruments the company holds may also affect reported income such events may make the company’s reported results appear volatile and could adversely affect the market for the company’s stock competitive factors the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which the company operates are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers the company relies heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price according to risk potential the company has remained competitive by closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies and by refining its risk measurement and price segmentation skills superior customer service claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in the company’s competitive strategy 11 

state insurance licenses the company’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements the licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing insurance regulation the company’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of the insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile the company’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliate are domiciled in the states of arizona colorado florida louisiana michigan new york ohio pennsylvania texas and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium changes and policy forms establishing reserve requirements prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to prior approval to mandated rates insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “subsidiary dividends” discussion in item 5c for further information on these dividend limitations under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves the quality of the insurer’s assets and the identity of the regulator the annual net premiums that an insurer may write are generally limited in relation to the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus may in certain cases limit its ability to grow its business the company is in the process of slowly increasing operating leverage through a higher ratio of net premiums written to surplus in its insurance subsidiaries where permitted the national association of insurance commissioners also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial 12 

condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies furthermore certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency in recent years legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in a number of states the company’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act fcra and the company’s data demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact on credit of extraordinary life events eg catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit also congress recently mandated that the federal government conduct a disparate impact study of the use of credit it is possible that congress may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating following completion of that study in some states the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators legislators or special interest groups to reduce freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to underlying costs including initiatives to roll back automobile and other personal lines rates this kind of activity has affected adversely and in the future may affect adversely the profitability and growth of the subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately or affecting the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways may occur in the future the impact of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted 13

liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of the company’s insurance subsidiaries the company’s objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves“ibnr” are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement among other factors these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known such adjustments if any are reflected in the current results of operations a detailed discussion of the company’s loss reserving practices can be found in its report on loss reserving practices  which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 29 2004 the accompanying tables present an analysis of propertycasualty losses and lae the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for 2004 2003 and 2002 on a gaap basis reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  

during 2004 and 2003 the company experienced 1091 million and 561 million respectively of favorable loss reserve development compared to 35 million of unfavorable development in 2002 the favorable development during 2004 was driven by actuarial adjustments as well as favorable “all other development” eg claims settling for more or less than reserved emergence of unreported claims at rates different than reserved and changes in reserve estimates by claims representatives the favorable “all other development” also reflects the continued recognition of lower severity for prior accident years than had been previously estimated in addition to the favorable claims development during 2003 the company benefited from a change in its estimate of the company’s future operating losses due to business assigned from the new york automobile insurance plan during 2002 the company made no significant change to the estimate of total loss reserves recorded in prior years the company conducts extensive reviews each month on portions of its business to help ensure that the company is meeting its objective of having reserves that are adequate with minimal variation the company takes into account the projected change in average severities of claims which is caused by the anticipated effect of inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written future average severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions and general economic trends these anticipated trends are monitored based on actual development and are modified if necessary 15

the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and lae from 1994 through 2003 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including ibnr the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the upper section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2004 the insurance subsidiaries had paid 11209 million of the currently estimated 11463 million of losses and lae that had been incurred through the end of 1995 thus an estimated 254 million of losses incurred through 1995 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date the cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1994 liability has developed favorably by 1487 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on the income of any one year the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 15 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 1997 but incurred in 1994 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 1994 1995 and 1996 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table the company experienced continually favorable reserve development from 1994 through 1998 primarily due to decreasing bodily injury severity from the beginning of 1994 continuously through the third quarter 1998 the company’s bodily injury severity decreased each quarter when compared to the same quarter of the prior year this period of decreasing severity for the company was not only longer than that experienced by the industry but also longer than at any time in the company’s recent history the reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the current accident year’s severity would increase over the prior accident year’s estimate as the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates the realization of the decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development late in 1998 the company started experiencing an increase in bodily injury severity as a result the reserve development has been much closer to the company’s original estimate the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 16 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements of the company’s insurance subsidiaries as filed with the state insurance departments  d financial information about geographic areas the company operates throughout the united states  e available information the company’s web site is progressivecom as soon as reasonably practicable the company makes all documents filed with or furnished to the sec including its reports on form 10k form 10q and form 8k and any amendments to these reports available free of charge via its web site at progressivecominvestors these reports are also available on the sec’s web site secgov 17

business unit writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 11 of the company’s total net premiums written in both 2003 and 2002 compared to 9 in 2001 although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto both businesses require the same fundamental skills including disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claims service the company’s commercial auto business is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel the company competes for this business on a nationwide basis with approximately 200 other companiesgroups with net premiums written in excess of 5 million annually the company’s commercial auto business ranked fourth in market share on a national basis in 2002 based on data reported by am best and estimates that it moved into the third position for 2003 other businesses the company’s other lines of business include the professional liability group plg and the motor carrier business unit during 2003 the company disbanded its lender’s collateral protection group lcpg since it ceased writing this business these groups are organized by customer group headquartered in cleveland ohio and accounted for approximately 1 of total revenue in 2003 the choice of distribution channel is driven by each customer group’s buying preference and service needs distribution channels include independent agents financial institutions vehicle dealers and companyemployed sales forces distribution arrangements are individually negotiated between such intermediaries and the company and are tailored to the specific needs of the customer group and the nature of the related financial or purchase transactions plg’s principal products are liability insurance for directors and officers and financial institution bonds the main product of which is employee dishonesty insurance its principal customers are community banks

collateral protection insurance for automobile lenders which was sold to financial institutions andor their customers commercial banks and finance companies were lcpg’s largest customer group for these services this business also served savings and loan institutions and credit unions during 2002 the company lost some key accounts for these products and this business was unable to meet its profitability target management believes that exiting this line of business does not materially affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows lcpg represented less than onefourth of one percent of the company’s total 2003 net premiums written 4   risk factors the company’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the company’s business if any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of the company’s common shares could decline materially the company competes in the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets which are highly competitive the company faces vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may also enter these markets in the future many of these companies may have greater financial marketing and management resources than the company in addition competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services which the company does not offer the company could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives the company from time to time undertakes strategic initiatives to maintain and improve its competitive position in auto insurance markets based on a culture that encourages innovation these strategies at times involve significant departures from the company’s andor its competitors’ thencurrent or historical modes of doing business as such the company’s innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals in addition these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt the company’s relationships with certain of its customers and business partners if the company is unable successfully to develop plan and implement its strategic initiatives in these competitive regulatory and legal environments its business could be materially adversely affected similarly the company undertakes distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition and drive growth if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors the company’s business could be materially adversely affected the highly competitive nature of the markets in which the company competes could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major competitor the company could be adversely affected as the company and other insurance companies would be required under statemandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and as the company would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders the ability of the company to attract develop and retain talented employees managers and executives and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to the company’s success in a time of growth the company must hire and train new employees and retain current employees as necessary to handle the resulting increase in new inquiries applications policies customers and claims the failure of the company to meet targeted employment goals could result in the company having to slow growth in the business units or markets that are affected in addition the failure to staff appropriately in the company’s claims organization could result in decreased quality of claims work which could also lower the company’s operating margins if growth slows or reverses the company would be required to forecast the changing business environments for multiple business units and in various geographic markets across the country with reasonable accuracy and adjust its hiring programs andor employment levels accordingly in some circumstances a reduction in force in one or more businesses or markets could be required if the company failed to recognize such changing operating environments or 5   was unable to reduce employment levels at the appropriate time overstaffing could result which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial results the company’s success also depends on its ability to attract develop and retain talented executives and other key managers the company’s loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business the company further believes that its success depends in large part on its ability to maintain and improve its staffing models and employee culture that have been developed over the years the company’s ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against the company legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of the company’s workers could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of the company’s operating performance and margins the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations the company’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment the company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on insurers the subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to the company’s success certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers which may adversely affect the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner the company’s compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies such as in recent years legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze set or roll back insurance premium rates as such insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable business or exit unprofitable markets in addition compliance with insurancerelated laws and regulations often will result in increased administrative costs to the company’s insurance subsidiaries these results in turn may adversely affect the company’s profitability or its ability or desire to grow its business in the applicable jurisdictions the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in actions by regulators fines and penalties and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s ability to do business in one or more jurisdictions in addition the company and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations moreover new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect the company’s operations or its ability to write business profitably in one or more states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the company is unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect the company’s businesses state insurance regulation may create risk and uncertainties for the company’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 11 of this report lawsuits challenging business practices of the company its competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future the progressive corporation andor its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of aftermarket parts total loss evaluation methodology the use of alternative commissions the use of credit in underwriting the alleged “diminution in value” of vehicles which are involved in accidents the methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury personal injury protection and medical 6   payment claims policy implementation and renewal procedures the classification of employees under federal and state wage and hour laws among other matters other litigation may be filed against the company andor its subsidiaries in the future concerning these or other business practices in addition lawsuits have been filed and other lawsuits may be filed in the future against the company’s competitors and other businesses and the results of those cases may create additional risks for andor impose additional costs andor limitations on the subsidiaries’ business operations litigation is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain lawsuits against the company routinely seek significant monetary damages from the company moreover as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in the insurance arena a new layer of courtimposed regulation could result in material increases in the company’s costs of doing business except to the extent the company has established loss reserves with respect to particular cases that are currently pending the company is unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or future cases may have on the business operations profitability or financial condition of the company for further information on pending litigation see note 11 litigation beginning on page appb21 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k the company’s success depends on its ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations depend on the company’s ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit in order to price accurately the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data develop test and apply appropriate rating formulae closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trend and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy the company’s ability to undertake these efforts successfully and as a result price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation  such risks may result in the company’s pricing being based on stale inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims as a result the company could underprice risks which would negatively affect the company’s margins or it could overprice risks which could reduce the company’s volume and competitiveness in either event the company’s operating results financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected the company’s financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses the company continues to be exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires and other events such as explosions terrorist attacks riots hazardous material releases utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the company’s total insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event in addition the company’s business could be further impaired if a significant portion of its business or systems were shut down by or if the company was unable to gain access to certain of its facilities as a result of such an event most of the company’s past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms the incidence and severity of 7   catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity the company’s financial performance cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected the company’s success depends on its ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately the company’s financial statements include loss reserves which represent the company’s best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which arises from a number of factors including  as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of such losses and expenses as reflected in the loss reserves included in the company’s financial statements consequently ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on the company’s loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 14 of this report as well as the company’s report on loss reserving practices which was filed with the sec on form 8k on june 27 2003 likewise the company must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under its policies many factors affect the company’s ability to pay claims accurately including the training and experience of the company’s claims representatives the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management the company’s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support its claims functions and other factors the company’s failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated losses to the company lead to material litigation undermine customer goodwill and the company’s reputation in the marketplace and impair the company’s brand image and as a result materially adversely affect the company’s financial results and liquidity the company’s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of its facilities systems and business functions including its information technology and other business systems the company’s business is highly dependent upon its employees’ ability to perform in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion necessary business functions such as internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business and processing and paying claims a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of the company’s facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of the company’s information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the company’s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis in addition because the company’s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems the company could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third party system fails or experiences an interruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the company’s ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary corporate functions this could result in a materially adverse effect on the company’s business results and liquidity to help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of its operations the company maintains backup systems or facilities for certain of its principal systems and services however these measures may prove to be 8   unsuccessful or inadequate against severe multiple or prolonged service interruptions or against interruptions of systems where no backup currently exists in addition the company has established emergency management teams comprised of senior managers from various corporate functions who are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events the emergency management teams’ ability to respond successfully to certain of these events may be limited depending on the nature of the event the completeness and effectiveness of the company’s plans to maintain business continuity upon the occurrence of such an event and other factors which may be beyond the company’s control the company maintains insurance on its real property and other physical assets which includes coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage however this insurance will not compensate the company for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of a computer data processing or telecommunications systems failure that is unrelated to covered property damage nor will such business interruption insurance necessarily compensate the company for all losses resulting from covered events a security breach of the company’s computer systems could also interrupt or damage its operations or harm its reputation in addition the company could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from its computer systems despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of the company’s computer systems these systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any wellpublicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the company’s systems which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the performance of the company’s fixedincome and equity investment portfolios are subject to investment risks the company’s fixedincome portfolio is subject to a number of risks including  the common equity portfolio is managed to track the russell 1000 index and is generally subject to the risk of equity market volatility a substantial decline in the value of the equities that make up the index would likely result in a substantial decline in the value of the company’s equity portfolio in addition both portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and the world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments held by the company and the company’s ability to liquidate investments on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted by national or international events including without limitation wars terrorist attacks recessions or depressions a significant change in inflation expectations a significant devaluation of governmental credit currencies or financial markets and other factors or events if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to be impaired by market sector or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree the company’s liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected under these circumstances the company’s income from these investments could be materially reduced and writedowns of the value of certain securities could further reduce the company’s reported earnings and capital levels a decrease in value of the company’s investment portfolio could also put the company’s insurance subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory capital requirements if the company was not at that time able to supplement its subsidiaries’ capital from the progressive corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms the company’s business could be materially adversely affected 9   the company’s insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the company which in turn may limit the company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to subsidiaries or affiliates the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if the companys subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation or are able to pay only limited amounts the holding company may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders make payments on its indebtedness meet its other obligations or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors  further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of the company’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “subsidiary dividends” on page 18 of this report the company does not manage analysts’ or investors’ earnings expectations and the company announces its financial results on a monthly basis which may result in stock price volatility the company believes that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if the company meets or exceeds certain financial goals and policies established by the company the company does not manage its business to maximize shortterm stock performance the company does not provide earnings estimates to the market and does not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result the company’s reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the company’s stock price the company publicly announces its financial results on a monthly basis in addition to the quarterly and annual public filings required by law the company believes that this level of reporting provides more timely disclosure to shareholders and potential investors enabling them to enhance their understanding of the company’s performance such reports however may disclose variation of results that investors might not see in quarterly reports consequently investor reaction to such variation could result in significant volatility in the company’s stock price similarly under applicable accounting rules the company may be required to record a significant loss or other adjustment to income in a specific monthly or quarterly reporting period in the event of a significant reserve adjustment catastrophic loss developments in litigation against the company otherthantemporary impairment write down of one or more investments or other extraordinary events in addition the change in market value of certain derivative instruments the company holds may also affect reported income such events may make the company’s reported results appear volatile and could adversely affect the market for the company’s stock competitive factors the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which the company operates are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered claims handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers the company relies heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price according to risk potential the company has remained competitive by closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies and by refining its risk measurement and price segmentation skills superior customer service claims adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in the company’s competitive strategy 10   state insurance licenses the company’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements the licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing insurance regulation the insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of the insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile the company’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliates are domiciled in the states of arizona colorado florida louisiana michigan mississippi new york ohio pennsylvania texas washington and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium rates and policy forms establishing reserve requirements prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “use and file” to prior approval to mandated rates insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “subsidiary dividends” discussion in item 5c for further information on these dividend limitations under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves the quality of the insurer’s assets and the identity of the regulator the annual net premiums that an insurer may write are generally limited in relation to the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus may in certain cases limit its ability to grow its business the company intends to begin a process to slowly increase operating leverage through a higher rate of net premiums to surplus in its agency direct and commercial insurance subsidiaries where permitted the national association of insurance commissioners also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or 11   deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies furthermore certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or nonrenewal of policies and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer solvency in recent years legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in a number of states the company’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act fcra and the company’s data demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate impact on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact of extraordinary life events ie catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and concerns about the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit also congress recently mandated that the federal government conduct a disparate impact study of the use of credit it is possible that congress may enact further legislation affecting the use of credit in underwriting and rating following completion of that study in some states the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators legislators or special interest groups to reduce freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to underlying costs including initiatives to roll back automobile and other personal lines rates this kind of activity has adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the profitability and growth of the subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately or affecting the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways may occur in the future the impact of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted 12   statutory accounting principles the company’s results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap which differ from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities primarily under gaap  investments the company employs a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that there is sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that can be profitably written the company’s portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities the company’s investment portfolio at market value was 125 billion at december 31 2003 compared to 103 billion at december 31 2002 investment income is affected by shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in interest rates and other factors investment income including net realized gainslosses on

operations beginning on page appb24 of the annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10k employees the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2003 was 25834 13   liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of the company’s insurance subsidiaries the company’s objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case and incurred but not reported reservesibnr are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claim settlement these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known such adjustments if any are reflected in the current results of operations the accompanying tables present an analysis of propertycasualty losses and lae the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for 2003 2002 and 2001 on a gaap basis reconciliation of net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  during 2003 and 2001 the company experienced 561 million and 990 million respectively of favorable loss reserve development compared to 35 million of unfavorable development in 2002 in addition to the favorable claims settlement during 2003 the company benefited from a change in its estimate of the company’s future operating losses due to business assigned from the new york automobile insurance plan during 2002 the company made no significant change to the estimate of loss reserves recorded in prior years the favorable development in 2001 is primarily attributable to the settlement of claims at less than amounts reserved and primarily relates to the 2000 accident year the company conducts extensive reviews each month on portions of its business to help ensure that the company is meeting its objective of having reserves that are adequate with minimal variation the anticipated effect of inflation is explicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and lae in addition the company takes into account the projected increase in average severities of claims which is caused by a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written future average severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions and general economic trends these anticipated trends are monitored based on actual development and are modified if necessary the company has not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 14   analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development millions

reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the upper section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2003 the companies had paid 9226 million of the currently estimated 9509 million of losses and lae that had been incurred through the end of 1994 thus an estimated 283 million of losses incurred through 1994 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date the cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1993 liability has developed conservatively by 2247 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on the income of any one year the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 14 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 1996 but incurred in 1993 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 1993 1994 and 1995 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table the company experienced continually favorable reserve development through 1998 primarily due to the decreasing bodily injury severity from the fourth quarter 1993 continuously through the third quarter 1998 the company’s bodily injury severity decreased each quarter when compared to the same quarter the prior year this period of decreasing severity for the company was not only longer than that experienced by the industry but also longer than any time in progressive’s history the adverse development in 2000 primarily for the 1999 accident year reflects the company’s inability to fully recognize the increasing loss trends that were emerging the reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the current accident year’s severity to increase over the prior accident year’s estimate as the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates the realization of the decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development during 1994 based on a review of the adequacy of its total loss reserves the company eliminated its 710 million “supplemental reserve” prior to 1994 the company established case and ibnr reserves by product with the objective of being accurate to within plus or minus two percent pricing had been based on these estimates of reserves by product because the company desired a very high degree of comfort that aggregate reserves were adequate aggregate reserves were established near the upper end of the reasonable range of reserves and the difference between such aggregate reserves and the midpoint of the reasonable range of case and ibnr reserves was called the “supplemental reserve” the company concluded after examining its historical aggregate reserves that the practice of setting aggregate reserves at the upper end of the range of reasonable reserves provided an unnecessarily high level of comfort even without the high level of comfort provided by the “supplemental reserve” the company’s reserves had generally been adequate the company believes that this change in the carried level of its reserves placed the company more in line with the practices of other companies in the industry the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 15 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements as filed with the state insurance departments this development table differs from the development displayed in schedule p part2 due to the fact schedule p part2 excludes adjusting costs and reflects the change in the method of accounting for salvage and subrogation for 1994 and 1993 16    d financial information about geographic areas the company operates throughout the united states the

 item 1   business tableend  the progressive insurance organization began business in 1937 the progressive corporation an insurance holding company formed in 1965 has 69 subsidiaries 1 mutual insurance company affiliate and 1 reciprocal insurance company affiliate the progressive corporation’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliates provide personal automobile insurance and other specialty propertycasualty insurance and related services throughout the united states the company’s propertycasualty insurance products protect its customers against collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles the company’s noninsurance subsidiaries generally support the company’s insurance and investment operations  incorporated by reference from note 9 segment information on pages appb16 and appb17 of the company’s annual report to shareholders which is included as exhibit 13 to this annual report on form 10k  the company offers a number of personal and commercial propertycasualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles net premiums written were 945 billion in 2002 compared to 726 billion in 2001 and 620 billion in 2000 the underwriting profit was 76 in 2002 compared to an underwriting profit of 48 in 2001 and an underwriting loss of 44 in 2000 personal lines the company’s personal lines segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles and recreation and other vehicles this business frequently offers more than one program in a single state with each targeted to a specific market or customer group personal lines accounted for 88 of total net premiums written in 2002 compared to 89 in 2001 and 91 in 2000 the company’s strategy is to become the lowcost provider of a full line of auto insurance products and related services distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers of the approximately 210 united states insurance company groups writing private passenger auto insurance the company ranked fourth in size for 2001 based on direct premiums written and estimates that it ranked third in size for 2002 for 2002 the estimated industry net premiums written which include personal auto insurance in the united states were 1410 billion and the company’s share of this market was approximately 59 compared to 1278 billion and 51 respectively in 2001 and 1196 billion and 47 in 2000 except as otherwise noted all industry data and the company’s market share or ranking in the industry either were derived directly from data reported by am best company inc “am best” or were estimated using am best data as the primary source 2   private passenger automobile insurance is comprised of preferred standard and nonstandard automobile risks the company actively participates in the market for each of these risks with the objective of offering a competitive rate for every risk volume potential is driven by the company’s ability to price competitively brand recognition and the actions of the company’s competitors among other factors see “competitive factors” on page 10 of this report for further discussion the company’s specialty personal lines products include insurance for motorcycles recreation vehicles mobile homes watercraft snowmobiles and similar items the company’s competitors are specialty companies and large multiline insurance carriers although industry figures are not available based on the company’s analysis of this market the company believes that it is one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market the company became the market share leader for personal watercraft in 2002 and has been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 the company discontinued writing new homeowner’s insurance in all states effective may 3 2002 this action was taken because the homeowner’s product did not meet the company’s goal of attracting more standard and preferred auto business by packaging a homeowner’s product with its auto product the company sold the homeowner’s product in arizona michigan maryland and illinois through a select number of independent agents prior to being discontinued the homeowner’s product accounted for less than onetenth of one percent of personal lines’ premiums written to minimize the overall exposure the company reinsured this risk through a 75 quota share agreement under which the company had a 25 net retention the personal lines business is generated either by an agent or broker or written directly by the company the agent channel includes business written by the company’s network of more than 30000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the united states insurance brokers in several states and through strategic alliance business relationships the independent insurance agencies have the authority to bind the company to specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines subject to compliance with certain companymandated procedures these guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk the agencies and brokers do not have authority on behalf of the company to settle or adjust claims establish underwriting guidelines develop rates or enter into other transactions or commitments the agent channel also establishes alliances with other insurance companies financial institutions employers and national brokerage agencies in 2002 the total net premiums written through the agent channel represented 70 of the personal lines volume compared to 71 in 2001 and 77 in 2000 direct business includes business written through 1800progressive online at progressivecom and on behalf of affinity groups net premiums written in the direct business were 30 29 and 23 of the personal lines volume in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively in 2000 the company introduced its service to coordinate vehicle claim repairs providing customers with a simpler way of getting their cars fixed following an accident in cities where new claims centers are located customers may choose to bring their vehicles directly to the claims center and pick up a rental vehicle the company will write the estimate select a qualified repair shop and inspect the vehicle after the repairs are complete this service reforms the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction increases the company’s productivity and improves the cycle time and quality of repairs the original pilot sites for this service were cleveland philadelphia tampa and virginia beach the pilot was expanded to three additional sites in 2002 the prototypes met the company’s acceptance criteria and 20 more sites are planned for 2003 auto insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because traffic law enforcement cultural attitudes insurance agents medical services and auto repair services vary by community the company’s organization enables it to meet varied local conditions under a cohesive set of policies and procedures designed to provide consistency and control the company’s business is organized into business areas agent direct claims and sales and service the agent direct and claims business areas are managed at a local level and divided into six regions each business has a group president and a process team with local managers at the state or regional level sales and service  which includes customer service calls direct sales calls and claims loss reporting among other services is performed at six regional sites in austin texas cleveland ohio colorado springs colorado sacramento california tampa florida and tempe arizona 3   the company’s executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the chief executive officer chief financial officer chief legal officer chief investment officer chief information officer and chief human resources officer as well as the company’s four group presidents agent direct claims and sales and service the group presidents are challenged to develop and manage product offerings and customer service processes tailored to the unique requirements of customers who select progressive as their auto insurance carrier and buy policies through the distribution mode of their choice commercial auto the commercial auto business unit writes primary liability physical damage and other autorelated insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented 11 of the company’s total net premiums written in 2002 although the commercial auto business differs from personal lines auto it requires the same fundamental skills that drive the company’s personal lines business which include disciplined underwriting and pricing as well as excellent claim service the company’s commercial auto business is primarily distributed through the independent agent channel the commercial vehicle business unit is currently operating in a market where average premiums are increasing based on the company’s analysis of this market the company competes for this business on a nationwide basis with approximately 150 other companies the company estimates that the commercial auto business currently ranks fifth in market share nationally other businesses the company’s other lines of business include the lenders’ collateral protection group lcpg professional liability group plg and motor carrier business unit which are organized by customer group and headquartered in cleveland ohio these businesses accounted for approximately 1 of total revenue in 2002 the choice of distribution channel is driven by each customer group’s buying preference and service needs distribution channels include independent agents financial institutions vehicle dealers and companyemployed sales forces distribution arrangements are individually negotiated between such intermediaries and the company and are tailored to the specific needs of the customer group and the nature of the related financial or purchase transactions lcpg primarily provides physical damage insurance and related tracking services to protect the commercial or retail lender’s interest in collateral which is not otherwise insured against these risks the principal product offered is collateral protection insurance for automobile lenders which is sold to financial institutions andor their customers commercial banks and finance companies are lcpg’s largest customer group for these services this business also serves savings and loan institutions and credit unions during 2002 the company lost some key accounts according to the company’s analysis this market as well as the company’s share of the market are declining in size lcpg represented less than 1 of the company’s total 2002 net premiums written the company is pursuing alternative approaches for exiting this line of business plg’s principal customers are community banks its principal products are liability insurance for directors and officers and employee dishonesty insurance progressive shares the risk and premium on these coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities the program is sponsored by the american bankers association the risk on these coverages is also reinsured by various reinsurance entities plg represented less than onefourth of one percent of the company’s total 2002 net premiums written the motor carrier business unit primarily processes business for commercial auto insurance procedures caip which are state supervised plans serving the involuntary markets the motor carrier business unit processes caip business in 26 states as a caip servicing carrier this business unit processes over 50 of the premiums in the caip market which is growing in size and assumes no indemnity risk to the extent the company fails to comply with contractual service standards the company would be restricted from ceding business to the caip plan the company competes with two other providers nationwide risk factors the company’s business involves various risks and uncertainties certain of which are discussed in this section this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other 4   reports and materials filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission “sec” as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the company’s business if any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of the company’s common shares could decline materially the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which the company operates are highly competitive the company faces vigorous competition from large wellcapitalized national companies and from smaller regional insurers other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may also enter these markets in the future many of these companies may have greater financial marketing and management resources than the company in addition competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services which the company is currently unable to offer the company could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives the company implements initiatives and strategies to maintain and improve its competitive position in auto insurance markets in addition the company undertakes distinctive advertising and other efforts to improve brand recognition and drive growth if these initiatives or advertising campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors the company’s business could be adversely affected the highly competitive nature of the markets in which the company competes could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors in the event of a failure of a major competitor the company could be adversely affected as the company and other insurance companies are forced to absorb the losses of the failed insurer under statemandated plans and as the company is faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders the ability to attract and retain talented employees managers and executives is critical to the company’s success the company’s ability to continue profitable growth and to remain a competitive force in the marketplace depends in part on its ability to hire and train talented new employees to handle work associated with the increase in new inquiries applications policies and customers and to respond to the increase in claims that will also result in addition the company’s ability to maintain appropriate staffing levels is affected by the rate of turnover of existing more experienced employees the failure to meet these employment goals could result in the company having to slow down growth in the business units or markets that are affected likewise the failure of the company to train effectively new employees in the claims area andor the loss of a significant number of experienced claims representatives and managers could result in the claims organization’s inability to handle an increasing workload in addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets this failure could result in decreased quality of claims work which in turn could lower the company’s operating margins the company’s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain talented executives and other key managers the company’s loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract talented new executives and managers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the company further believes that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve its staffing models and employee culture that have been developed over the years the company’s ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against the company new legislation at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace in such events the productivity of certain of the company’s workers could be adversely affected which could lead to an erosion of the company’s operating performance and margins the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations the company’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment the company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia 5   state insurance laws and regulations are complex and each jurisdiction’s requirements are different certain states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of certain actions which may adversely affect the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate innovate obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow their businesses profitably in addition certain federal laws impose additional requirements on insurers the company’s ability to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to its success the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in actions by regulators fines and penalties and in extreme cases revocation of a subsidiary’s ability to do business in that jurisdiction in addition the company and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations in recent years legislation voter initiatives and other regulatory actions have dealt with among other issues  compliance with laws and regulations addressing these and other issues often will result in increased administrative costs to the company’s insurance subsidiaries in addition such laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and may restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable business or exit unprofitable markets these results in turn may adversely affect the company’s profitability or its ability or desire to grow its business in the applicable jurisdictions state insurance regulation may create risk and uncertainties for the company’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well for further information on these risks and uncertainties see the “insurance regulation” discussion beginning on page 11 of this report moreover new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future such enactments may adversely affect the company’s operations or its ability to write business profitably in one or more states in such events the company may seek to reduce its writings in or to withdraw entirely from those states in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary the company is unable to predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect the company’s business will be adopted in the future the timing of any such adoption and what effects if any they may have on the company’s operations profitability and financial condition lawsuits challenging various aspects of the company’s business practices continue to be filed against the company and its subsidiaries the company is named as a defendant in a number of putative class actions and other lawsuits challenging aspects of the company’s business operations these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the company’s use of aftermarket parts total loss evaluation methodology the use of alternative commissions the use of credit in underwriting the alleged diminution in value of vehicles which are involved in accidents the methods used by the subsidiaries for evaluating certain bodily injury claims the subsidiaries’ methods for evaluating and paying certain personal injury protection claims the company’s classification of employees under federal and state wage and hour laws and other cases other litigation may be filed against the company in the future concerning these or other of the company’s business practices litigation by its very nature is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain further except to the extent the company has established loss reserves with respect to particular cases the company is unable to predict the effect if any that these pending or future cases may have on the business operations profitability or financial condition of the company for further information on pending litigation see note 11 litigation on pages appb18 and appb19 of the company’s annual report to shareholders which is included as exhibit 13 to this annual report on form 10k 6   the company’s success depends on its ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders the company’s operating performance and financial condition depend on the company’s ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit if the company fails to assess accurately the risks that it assumes the company may fail to establish adequate premium rates which could reduce income and have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results or financial condition in order to price accurately the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data develop test and apply appropriate rating formulae closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trend and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy the company’s ability to undertake these efforts successfully and as a result price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including without limitation  such risks may result in the company’s pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses assumptions or methodologies and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future increases in the frequency or severity of claims as a result the company could underprice risks which would negatively affect the company’s margins or it could overprice risks which could reduce the company’s volume and competitiveness in either event the company’s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected the company’s financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses the company continues to be exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes catastrophes can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms earthquakes hailstorms severe winter weather and fires and other events such as an explosion terrorist attacks or riots the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the company’s total insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event in addition the company’s business could be further impaired if a significant portion of its business or systems were shut down by such an event some catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas however hurricanes tornadoes winter storms windstorms earthquakes terrorist attacks and other manmade catastrophes may produce significant damage over large heavily populated areas most of the company’s past catastropherelated claims have resulted from severe storms the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable when they occur with enough severity the company’s financial performance could be materially adversely affected the company’s success depends on its ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately the company’s financial statements include loss reserves which represent the company’s best estimate of the amounts that the company will ultimately pay on claims and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of the financial statements there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves which arises from a number of factors including  7    as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate perhaps substantially from pointintime estimates of losses included in the loss reserves in the company’s financial statements the company’s actual claim payments may exceed its claim reserves causing the company to incur losses the company did not anticipate and its earnings may be significantly and negatively affected as a result consequently ultimate losses could materially exceed loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial position further information on the company’s loss reserves can be found in the “liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses” discussion beginning on page 14 of this report as well as the company’s report on loss reserving practices which was filed with the sec on form 8k on july 1 2002 likewise the company must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under its policies many factors affect the company’s ability to pay claims accurately including the training and experience of the company’s claims representatives the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management the company’s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support its claims functions and other factors the company’s failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation undermine the company’s reputation in the marketplace impair the company’s brand image and materially adversely affect the company’s financial results and liquidity the company’s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of its business functions including its information technology and other business systems the company’s employees use its facilities and systems to process the daytoday work generated by the company’s operations included in this work are support for the company’s agent and direct auto insurance businesses including internet support and 24hour call centers processing new and renewal business processing and paying claims actuarial and other functions necessary for underwriting and rate development corporate support functions and other operations the company’s business is highly dependent upon its ability to perform these functions in an uninterrupted fashion a sustained shutdown of one or more of the company’s facilities or a failure of one or more of the company’s information technology telecommunications or other business systems could significantly impair the company’s ability to perform these functions on a timely basis in addition because the company’s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems the company could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or third party systems fail or experience interruptions if sustained or repeated such a business interruption systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the company’s ability to write and process new and renewal business provide customer service pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary corporate functions this could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results to help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of its operations the company maintains redundant systems or facilities for certain of its principal systems and services however these efforts may prove unsuccessful against severe multiple or prolonged interruptions of the company’s business or against interruptions of systems where no redundancy currently exists in addition the company has established an emergency management team comprised of senior managers from various corporate functions who are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events the emergency management team’s ability to respond successfully to certain of these events may be limited however since the company has not completely developed the plans necessary to maintain business continuity for some significant business interruption scenarios the company maintains insurance on its real property and other physical assets which includes coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage however this insurance will not compensate the company for losses that may occur due to 8   disruptions in service as a result of a computer data processing or telecommunications systems failure that is unrelated to covered property damage nor will such business interruption insurance necessarily compensate the company for all losses resulting from covered events a security breach of the company’s computer systems could interrupt its operations or damage its reputation in addition the company could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from its computer systems despite the implementation of security measures including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of the company’s computer systems this infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems any wellpublicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the company’s systems which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business the performance of the company’s investment portfolio is subject to a number of investment risks investments in the company’s investment portfolio have varying degrees of risk the most significant risk to the fixedincome portfolio is interest rate risk including movements in the underlying market rates and changes in the credit spreads of the respective sectors of the fixedincome securities held in addition the fixedincome portfolio is subject to credit risk ie that the value of or income from instruments held would be impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments the common equity portfolio is managed to the russell 1000 index and is generally subject to the risk of equity market volatility a sustained decline in the value of the equities that make up the index could result in a substantial decline in the value of the company’s equity portfolio in addition both portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and the world’s capital markets the functioning of those markets the values of the investments held by the company and the company’s ability to liquidate investments on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted by national or international events including without limitation wars terrorist attacks recessions or depressions high inflation or a deflationary environment the collapse of governments or financial markets and other factors or events if the fixedincome or equity portfolios or both were to be impaired by market or issuerspecific conditions to a substantial degree the company’s liquidity financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected further the company’s income from these investments could be materially reduced and writedowns of the value of certain securities could further reduce the company’s profitability in addition a decrease in value of the company’s investment portfolio could put the company’s insurance subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory capital requirements if the company was not at that time able to supplement its capital by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms the company’s ability to continue growing could be adversely affected the company’s insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the company which in turn may limit the company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to subsidiaries or affiliates the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own consequently if the company’s subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the holding company or are able to pay only limited amounts the holding company may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders to make payments on its indebtedness or to make capital contributions or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates each subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors  further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of the company’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5c “subsidiary dividends” on page 18 of this report 9   the price of the company’s stock may vary significantly based on investors’ perceptions of the company’s reported performance public statements or corporate governance issues the company believes that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if the company meets or exceeds certain financial goals and policies established by the company the company does not manage its business to maximize shortterm stock performance the company does not provide earnings guidance to the market and does not comment on earnings estimates by analysts as a result the company’s reported results for a particular period may vary perhaps significantly from investors’ expectations which could result in significant volatility in the company’s stock price the company publicly announces its underwriting results on a monthly basis in addition to the traditional quarterly and annual announcements and public filings required by law the company believes that this level of reporting provides more and faster disclosure to shareholders and potential investors enabling them to better understand the company’s underwriting performance such reports however may show a degree of variation in results that investors might not see in a quarterly report which could result in significant volatility in the company’s stock price similarly under applicable accounting rules the company may be required to record a significant loss or establish a significant reserve in a specific monthly or quarterly reporting period in the event of a catastrophic loss developments in litigation against the company or other extraordinary events such events may make the company’s reported results appear volatile and could adversely affect the market for the company’s stock the company has adopted certain corporate governance policies and procedures and the company must further satisfy the complex requirements of applicable law sec regulations and new york stock exchange listing standards with respect to such matters which are currently evolving while the company intends to fully comply with all such laws regulations and standards and believes that its corporate governance program has been designed in the best interests of the company and its shareholders it is possible that investors or independent advisory firms may disagree with one or more aspects of the company’s governance program and may publicize that disagreement which could adversely affect the market for the company’s stock competitive factors the automobile insurance and other propertycasualty markets in which the company operates are highly competitive propertycasualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price consumer recognition coverages offered claim handling financial stability customer service and geographic coverage vigorous competition is provided by large wellcapitalized national companies some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents and by smaller regional insurers while the company relies heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price according to risk potential some competitors merely price their coverage at rates set lower than the company’s published rates by avoiding extensive data gathering and analysis these competitors incur lower underwriting expenses the company has remained competitive by closely managing expenses and achieving operating efficiencies and by refining its risk measurement and price segmentation skills superior customer service claim adjusting and strong brand recognition are also important factors in the company’s competitive strategy 10   state insurance licenses the company’s insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various insurance authorities these licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements the licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written in the issuing state such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria all licenses which are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing insurance regulation the insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business at least one of the insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the district of columbia the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction generally an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile the company’s insurance subsidiaries and affiliates are domiciled in the states of arizona california colorado illinois florida louisiana michigan mississippi new york ohio pennsylvania texas washington and wisconsin state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents regulating premium rates and policy forms establishing reserve requirements prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted rate regulation varies from “file and use” to prior approval to mandated rates most jurisdictions prohibit rates that are “excessive inadequate or unfairly discriminatory” insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions including loans and cash advances between regulated insurers and their affiliates see the “subsidiary dividends” discussion in item 5c for further information on these dividend limitations under state insolvency and guaranty laws regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers insurers are also required by many states as a condition of doing business in the state to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market these “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks as well as the allowable premium many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks these plans through assessments pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors including the type of business being written the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves the quality of the insurer’s assets and the identity of the regulator as a general rule the regulators prefer that annual net premiums written be not more than three times the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus thus the amount of an insurer’s surplus may in certain cases limit its ability to grow its business the national association of insurance commissioners also has developed a riskbased capital rbc program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition rbc is a series of dynamic surplusrelated formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks such as asset credit and underwriting risks 11   many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market for example certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or nonrenew policies furthermore certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption laws and regulations that limit cancellation or nonrenewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise some changes may be due to economic developments such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer solvency in recent years legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced and in some cases adopted which deal with use of nonpublic consumer information use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting insurance rate development rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or nonrenew insurance policies reflecting concerns about consumer privacy coverage availability prices and alleged discriminatory pricing in addition from time to time the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary in a number of states the company’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information credit as part of the underwriting or rating process this practice is expressly authorized by the federal fair credit reporting act fcra and the company’s data demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk the use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative activity regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit including questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports perceptions that credit may have a disparate impact on the poor and certain minority groups the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk the treatment of persons with limited or no credit the impact of extraordinary life events ie catastrophic injury or death of a spouse and concerns about the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers a number of state insurance departments have issued bulletins directives or regulations to regulate the use of credit by insurers in addition a number of states are considering or have passed legislation to regulate insurers’ use of credit it is also possible that when congress considers reauthorizing certain fcra preemptions due to expire on january 1 2004 the use of credit in underwriting and rating may be a subject of federal legislation in some states the automobile insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators legislators or special interest groups to reduce freeze or set rates to or at levels that are not necessarily related to underlying costs including initiatives to roll back automobile and other personal lines rates this kind of activity has adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the profitability and growth of the subsidiaries’ automobile insurance business in those jurisdictions and may limit the subsidiaries’ ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the subsidiaries’ ability to price automobile insurance adequately or affecting the subsidiaries’ insurance operations adversely in other ways may occur in the future the impact of these regulatory changes on the subsidiaries’ businesses cannot be predicted 12   statutory accounting principles the company’s results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap which differ from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities specifically under gaap  investments the company employs a conservative approach to investment and capital management intended to ensure that there is sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premium that can be profitably written the company’s portfolio is invested primarily in shortterm and intermediateterm investmentgrade fixedincome securities the company’s investment portfolio at market value was 103 billion at december 31 2002 compared to 82 billion at december 31 2001 investment income is affected by shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio changes in interest rates and other factors investment income including net realized gainslosses on securities before expenses and taxes was 3766 million in 2002 compared to 3017 million in 2001 and 4021 million in 2000 see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning on page appb21 of the company’s annual report which is included as exhibit 13 to this annual report on form 10k employees the number of employees excluding temporary employees at december 31 2002 was 22974 13   liability for propertycasualty losses and loss adjustment expenses the consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of the company’s insurance subsidiaries the company’s objective is to ensure that total reserves ie case and incurred but not reported reservesibnr are adequate to cover all loss costs while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed the liabilities for losses and lae are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and lae incurred through december 31 of each year these estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claim settlement these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known such adjustments if any are reflected in the current results of operations the accompanying tables present an analysis of propertycasualty losses and lae the following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for 2002 2001 and 2000 on a gaap basis  during 2002 the company experienced 35 million of unfavorable loss reserve development compared to 990 million of favorable development in 2001 and 758 million of unfavorable development in 2000 during 2002 the company made no significant change to the estimate of loss reserves recorded in prior years the favorable development in 2001 is primarily attributable to the settlement of claims at less than amounts reserved while the prior year’s adverse development reflected the company’s effort to fully recognize the loss trends that were emerging the development in 2001 primarily relates to the 2000 accident year while the majority of the 2000 unfavorable development related to the 1999 accident year the company conducts extensive reviews each month on portions of its business to help ensure that the company is meeting its objective of having reserves that are adequate with minimal variation the anticipated effect of inflation is explicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and lae while anticipated increases due to inflation are considered in estimating the ultimate claim costs the increase in average severities of claims is caused by a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written future average severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards inflation policy provisions and general economic trends these anticipated trends are monitored based on actual development and are modified if necessary the company has not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves 14   analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development millions  1 represents loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses at the balance sheet date 2 cumulative development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and lae 3 in 1993 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards 113 “accounting and reporting of shortduration and longduration contracts” and per the provisions of the statement began presenting its liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis 4 in 1994 based on a review of its total loss reserves the company eliminated its 710 million “supplemental reserve” 15   the above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for 1992 through 2001 the top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the propertycasualty insurance subsidiaries only this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims that are unpaid at the balance sheet date including losses that had been incurred but not reported the table also presents the reestimated liability for unpaid losses and lae on a gross basis with separate disclosure of the reestimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses the presentation appears for all periods in which the income recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards 113 “accounting and reporting for reinsurance of shortduration and longduration contracts” have been applied the upper section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year the lower portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year the estimate is increased or decreased as more information about the claims becomes known for individual years for example as of december 31 2002 the companies had paid 7591 million of the currently estimated 7870 million of losses and lae that had been incurred through the end of 1993 thus an estimated 279 million of losses incurred through 1993 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date the cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years for example the 1992 liability has developed conservatively by 2434 million over ten years that amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on the income of any one year the effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and lae are shown in the reconciliation table on page 14 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and lae in evaluating this information note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods for example the amount of the development related to losses settled in 1995 but incurred in 1992 will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 1992 1993 and 1994 conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future accordingly it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table the company experienced continually favorable reserve development through 1998 primarily due to the decreasing bodily injury severity from the fourth quarter 1993 continuously through the third quarter 1998 the company’s bodily injury severity decreased each quarter when compared to the same quarter the prior year this period of decreasing severity for the company was not only longer than that experienced by the industry but also longer than any time in progressive’s history the reserves established as of the end of each year assumed the current accident year’s severity to increase over the prior accident year’s estimate as the experience continued to be evaluated at later dates the realization of the decreased severity resulted in favorable reserve development during 1994 based on a review of the adequacy of its total loss reserves the company eliminated its 710 million “supplemental reserve” prior to 1994 the company established case and ibnr reserves by product with the objective of being accurate to within plus or minus two percent pricing had been based on these estimates of reserves by product because the company desired a very high degree of comfort that aggregate reserves were adequate aggregate reserves were established near the upper end of the reasonable range of reserves and the difference between such aggregate reserves and the midpoint of the reasonable range of case and ibnr reserves was called the “supplemental reserve” the company concluded after examining its historical aggregate reserves that the practice of setting aggregate reserves at the upper end of the range of reasonable reserves provided an unnecessarily high level of comfort even without the high level of comfort provided by the “supplemental reserve” the company’s reserves had historically been conservative the company believes that this change in the estimate of its reserves placed the company more in line with the practices of other companies in the industry the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expenses development table on page 15 is constructed from schedule p part1 from the consolidated annual statements as filed with the state insurance departments this development table differs from the development displayed in schedule p part2 due to the fact schedule p part2 excludes unallocated loss adjustment expenses and reflects the change in the method of accounting for salvage and subrogation for 1994 and prior years 16    d financial information about geographic areas the company operates throughout the united states the company ceased writing new business in canada in 1999  e available
