see item 7 mda critical accounting policies section and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters 

competition 

missouri and kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model as a result the evergy companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a writeoff of certain regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory this competition primarily occurs within the spp integrated marketplace in which evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are participants this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time for maximum regional costeffectiveness 

the spp integrated marketplace is similar to other regional transmission organization rto or independent system operator iso markets currently operating in other regions of the united states 

power supply 

evergy has approximately 15400 megawatts mws of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements evergys owned generation and power purchases from others as a percentage of total megawatt hours mwhs generated and purchased was approximately 70 and 30 respectively over the last three years evergy purchases power to meet its customers needs to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards management believes evergy will be able to meet its future power purchase needs due to the coordination of planning and operations in the spp region and existing power purchase agreements however price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand or reduced supply 

evergys total capacity by fuel type including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements is detailed in the table below 



a mws are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility includes owned generating capacity of 579 mws and longterm power purchase agreements of approximately 3747 mws of wind generation that expire from 2028 through 2048 see item 2 properties for additional information 

b includes a longterm power purchase agreement for approximately 66 mws of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023 

evergys projected peak summer demand for 2022 is approximately 10200 mws evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for 2022 with its existing generation assets and power purchases see 

transitioning evergys generation fleet below for further information regarding evergys longterm strategy with regards to its generating assets and power purchases 

evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are members of the spp the spp is a fercapproved rto with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region as spp members evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 12 this net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership capacity agreements power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs the reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the regions electric supply 

environmental matters 

the evergy companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal state and local environmental laws regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality waste management and hazardous substance disposal protected natural resources such as wetlands endangered species and other protected wildlife and health and safety for example evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  and other greenhouse gases ghg federal legislation regulates the emission of ghgs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce ghg emissions the environmental protection agency epa the kansas department of health and environment kdhe and the missouri department of natural resources mdnr regulate emissions under the clean air act amendments of 1990 caa water under the clean water act cwa and waste management under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra among other laws and regulations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information there have been and management believes there will continue to be policy legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce ghg emissions impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency these efforts and climate change itself have the potential to adversely affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows see part i item 1a risk factors for additional information 

the evergy companies have taken and will continue to take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses for example the evergy companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events including storms which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change in addition the evergy companies have invested and will continue to invest in grid resiliency much of the evergy companies infrastructure is aged and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems during severe weather the evergy companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion 

transitioning evergys generation fleet 

the evergy companies are committed to a longterm strategy to reduce co 2 emissions in a costeffective and reliable manner in 2021 evergy achieved a reduction of co 2 emissions by about half from 2005 levels evergy has a goal to achieve netzero co 2 emissions by 2045 which includes an interim goal of a 70 reduction of co 2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 the trajectory and timing of reaching evergys netzero co 2 emissions goal are dependent on enabling technology developments the reliability of the power grid and supportive energy policies and regulations and could also be impacted by political legal and regulatory actions 

public attention is currently focused on transitioning to a low carbon future including reducing ghg emissions and closing coalfired generating units diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits for example because renewable generation is intermittent diversity of baseload generation including a mix of coal and natural gas has helped to maintain a consistent availability of power in addition the evergy companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the evergy companies to include in rates the evergy companies use a triennial integrated resource plan which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity to inform the manner in which they supply electricity the integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand fuel prices transmission improvements 

new generating capacity cost of environmental compliance integration of renewables energy storage energy efficiency and demand response initiatives strategies that the evergy companies are pursuing to reduce emissions include 

• retiring fossil fuel generation 

• developing renewable energy facilities 

• collaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources and 

• investing in customer energy efficiency programs 

since 2005 the evergy companies have added over 4400 mws of renewable generation while retiring more than 2400 mws of fossil generation see item 2 properties for additional information regarding the evergy companies renewable generation resources the evergy companies are also committed to transparency on its website httpinvestorsevergycom evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental social and governance matters including information related to emissions waste and water the contents of the website including reports and documents contained therein are not incorporated into this filing

 item 1a risk factors 

utility regulatory risks 

prices are established by regulators and may not be sufficient to recover costs or provide for a return on investment 

the prices that the ferc kcc and mpsc authorize the utility subsidiaries of evergy to charge significantly influence the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in general utilities are allowed to recover in customer rates costs that were prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on invested capital there can be no assurance however that regulators will determine costs to have been prudently incurred further the amounts approved by the regulators may not be sufficient to allow for a recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments also amounts that were approved by regulators may be appealed modified limited or eliminated by subsequent regulatory or legislative actions a failure to recover costs or earn a reasonable return on invested capital could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of evergy and its utility subsidiaries 

the evergy companies are also exposed to costrecovery shortfalls due to the inherent regulatory lag in the ratesetting process this is because utility rates are generally based on historical information and except for certain situations where regulators allow for recovery of expenses through use of a formula that tracks costs are not subject to adjustment between rate cases evergy kansas central and evergy metro agreed to a fiveyear base rate moratorium in kansas beginning in december 2018 in addition evergy metro and evergy missouri west utilize a plantin service accounting pisa legislative mechanism in missouri which requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following evergy metros and evergy missouri wests last general rate case and limits the extent to which prices can increase thereafter to approximately 3 on an annualized basis evergy metro and evergy missouri west are currently operating under pisa constraints each filed general rate cases in 2022 and will be subject to pisa constraints for three years following conclusion of the general rate cases the rate cases are expected to conclude by december 2022 these and other factors may result in underrecovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment or both 

furthermore while inflation has been relatively muted in recent years during 2021 the united states economy experienced a substantial rise in the inflation rate while the federal reserve bank has announced certain measures to combat rising inflation there is increased uncertainty in the nearterm outlook as to whether inflation will continue increases in inflation raise the evergy companies costs for labor materials and services a failure to recover increased capital costs could result in underrecovery of costs 

failure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings reduced access to capital markets increased financing costs lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures in response to competitive economic political legislative public perception and regulatory pressures evergys utility subsidiaries may be subject to rate moratoriums rate refunds limits on rate increases lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions including phasein plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period for the benefit of customers in addition transource which evergy owns a 135 interest is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects across the united states and faces similar risks with respect to projects located in regulatory jurisdictions outside of kansas and missouri any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of the evergy companies 

legislative and regulatory requirements may increase costs and result in compliance penalties 

ferc the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and spp have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that 

apply to public utilities the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements such as vegetation management standards facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards in addition evergy is also subject to health safety and other requirements enacted by the occupational safety and health administration the department of transportation the department of labor and other federal and state agencies as discussed more fully below the evergy companies are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations related to nuclear power generation the costs of complying with existing new or modified regulations standards and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies furthermore regulatory changes could result in operational changes that increase costs or adversely impact the evergy companies prospects in addition failure to meet quality of service reliability cybersecurity critical infrastructure protection operational or other standards and requirements could expose the evergy companies to penalties additional compliance costs or adverse rate consequences any of which could have a material adverse impact on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

environmental risks 

costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including those relating to air and water quality waste management and hazardous substance disposal protected natural resources and health and safety are significant and may adversely impact operations and financial results 

the evergy companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal state and local environmental laws regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality waste management and hazardous substance disposal protected natural resources such as wetlands endangered species and other protected wildlife and health and safety see item 1 business  environmental matters and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in general over time these laws and regulations have become and continue to become increasingly stringent and compliance with these laws and regulations require an increasing share of capital and operating resources which may reduce the amount of resources available for other business objectives including capital investments 

compliance with these laws regulations and requirements requires significant capital and operating resources regulators may also disagree with the evergy companies interpretation or application of these laws regulations and requirements the failure to comply with these laws regulations and requirements could result in substantial fines injunctive relief and other sanctions for example evergy kansas central recently decommissioned the tecumseh energy center and removed all coal combustion residuals ccrs from a surface impoundment in a manner it believed complied with federal law but the epa has recently commenced an evaluation of whether evergy kansas central should have taken additional or alternative actions even though the facility is closed 

the epa has begun issuing ccr part a rule extension application determinations for companies that applied for approval to operate unlined or claylined impoundments past april 2021 the evergy companies did not apply for an extension however these proposed determinations include extensive ccr rule interpretations and compliance expectations that may impact all owners of ccr units the new interpretations could require modified compliance plans such as different methods of ccr unit closure additionally more stringent remediation requirements for units that are in corrective action or forced to go into corrective action could result in substantial costs or operational impacts 

in january 2022 the epa announced changes following a tour by the epa administrator conducted in the second half of 2021 to address issues in communities that are marginalized underserved and overburdened by pollution these changes will include additional unannounced inspections of suspected noncompliant facilities deploying new assets to monitor air pollution and a general increase in overall monitoring and oversight the epas announcement focused on industries in louisiana mississippi and texas but includes similar agencywide action in parallel the evergy companies have multiple power plants located in communities that would be considered a higher priority by the epa based on existing demographics these sites could be subject to additional monitoring and unannounced inspections in the future 

environmental permits are subject to periodic renewal which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits new facilities or modifications of existing facilities may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits delays in the environmental permitting process public opposition and challenges denials of permit applications limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects and thus materially adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in addition compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements could alter the way assets are managed which in turn could result in retiring assets earlier than expected recording asset retirement obligations aros or having a regulator disallow recovery of costs that had been prudently incurred in connection with those assets there is also a risk of lawsuits alleging violations of environmental laws regulations or requirements claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other relief 

costs of compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements or fines penalties or negative lawsuit outcomes if not recovered in rates from customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

financial risks 

financial market disruptions or declines in the evergy companies credit ratings may increase financing costs and limit access to the credit markets which may adversely affect liquidity and financial results 

the evergy companies rely on funds from operations and access to the capital and credit markets to fund capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity disruption in capital or credit markets increases in interest rates deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which the evergy companies rely credit rating downgrades a decrease in the market price of evergys common stock or a decrease or disappearance in the demand for debt securities issued by the evergy companies or subsidiaries could have material adverse effects on the evergy companies these effects could include among others reduced access to capital and increased cost of borrowed funds and collateral requirements dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other postretirement benefit plan funding requirements reduced ability to pay dividends rate case disallowance of costs of capital reductions in or delays of capital expenditures and limitations in the ability of evergy to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 

the evergy companies plan to make significant capital investments in renewable generation and to enhance the customer experience improve reliability and resiliency and improve efficiency which are expected to be funded with cash flows from operations and debt if cash flows from operations are lower than expected or the costs of these capital investments are higher than expected additional debt will be required to fund the investments which in turn may create pressure on the evergy companies credit ratings or result in a ratings downgrade and increase their cost of capital in 2021 a credit ratings agency assigned the evergy companies a negative outlook while affirming ratings due to perceived risk related to increased capital expenditures and the ability to earn a return of and on those investments through upcoming rate cases further evergy kansas central and evergy metro have outstanding taxexempt bonds that may be put back to the respective issuer at the option of the holders which could adversely impact liquidity in addition market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on evergys lenders suppliers and other counterparties or customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations 

evergy is a holding company and relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations 

evergy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its direct subsidiaries particularly evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west evergys subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide evergy with funds the ability of evergys subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions and accordingly evergys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the earnings and cash flows capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries as well as regulatory factors financial covenants general business conditions and other matters 

in addition the evergy companies are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends under the federal power act evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings each of evergy metro and evergy missouri west has committed to missouri regulators to not pay dividends to evergy if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services each of evergy kansas central and evergy metro has committed to kansas regulators to not pay dividends to evergy if i the payment would result in an increase in the utilitys debt level excluding shortterm debt and debt due within one year above 60 percent of its total capitalization absent approval from the kcc or ii if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services under various debt agreements the evergy companies are also required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 065 to 100 which could restrict the amount of dividends the evergy companies are permitted to pay evergy cannot guarantee dividends will be paid in the future or that if paid dividends will satisfy announced targets or investor expectations or be paid with the same frequency as in the past 

in addition from time to time evergy has in the past and may in the future guarantee debt obligations of its subsidiaries under the financing agreements to which evergy is a party a guarantee of debt may be considered indebtedness for purposes of complying with financial covenants that dictate the extent to which evergy can borrow money and any guarantee payments could adversely affect evergys liquidity and ability to service its own debt obligations 

increasing costs associated with defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans health care plans and other employee benefits could adversely affect evergys financial position and liquidity 

evergy maintains defined benefit retirement and other postretirement employee benefit plans for certain current and former employees the costs of these plans depend on a number of factors including the rates of return on plan assets the level and nature of the provided benefits discount rates the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels changes in benefit design changes in laws or regulations and the amount of any required or voluntary contributions to the plans the evergy companies have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans also if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels these plans experience adverse market returns on investments or interest rates fall required or voluntary contributions to the plans could be material in addition changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs returns on investments interest rates and other actuarial assumptions including projected retirements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased in recent years and may continue to rise in the future future legislative changes related to health care could also cause significant changes to benefit programs and costs the increasing costs associated with health care plans could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the evergy companies are subject to commodity and other risks associated with energy markets 

the evergy companies are required to maintain generation capacity that satisfies regulatory mandates and are obligated to provide power when required by the spp or pursuant to contractual obligations although the evergy companies generally have regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power necessary to satisfy these requirements regulatory or legislative actions could limit eliminate or delay recovery of these expenses after the expenses have been incurred 

the evergy companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity and the wholesale purchase of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to limited energy marketing activities and the management of thirdparty generation facilities these activities expose the evergy companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energyrelated products as well credit exposure to their counterparties exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the availability and cost of fuel and power that the evergy companies purchase on the wholesale markets to serve customer load or to satisfy their regulatory or contractual obligations the ability or effectiveness of strategies utilized by the evergy companies to hedge these risks the extent to which the evergy companies may be required to post collateral for the benefit of third parties and the risk that counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations to the evergy companies market volatility can 

increase or create unanticipated risks regional transmission organizations and independent system operators may also retroactively reprice transactions following execution 

subject to certain regulatory constraints the evergy companies use derivative instruments such as transmission congestion rights tcrs swaps options futures and forwards to manage commodity and financial risks losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts if a counterparty fails to perform or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or the use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts the evergy companies cannot assure that their risk management practices will be effective or will mitigate all risks 

the results of operations financial position and liquidity of the evergy companies could be materially adversely affected if the evergy companies fail to recover or experience a delay in the recovery of fuel and purchased power expenses if the evergy companies fail to adequately hedge or mitigate commodity or energy market risks if the evergy companies are required to provide collateral in amounts greater than planned if energy marketing transactions are retroactively repriced or if counterparties fail to fulfill obligations to the evergy companies 

tax legislation and an inability to utilize tax credits could adversely impact results of operations financial position and liquidity 

tax laws and regulations can adversely affect among other things financial results liquidity credit ratings and the valuation of assets such as deferred income tax assets the evergy companies regularly assess their ability to utilize tax benefits including those in the form of net operating loss nol tax credit and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on its balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary a reduction in or disallowance of these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the evergy companies 

additionally changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire could have an adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and liquidity of the evergy companies in addition the evergy companies construct and operate renewable energy facilities that generate tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations the amount of tax credits is dependent on several factors including the amount of electricity produced and the applicable tax credit rate a variety of factors including transmission constraints the ability to timely complete construction of renewable energy facilities adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment could significantly reduce these tax credits which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the evergy companies 

the anticipated benefits of the evergy companies strategy may not be realized 

the evergy companies strategy includes significant planned reductions in operating and maintenance expense and significant planned increases in capital investments the evergy companies strategy also includes a different mix of capital investments than has been pursued in the past including significant capital investments in renewable generation the evergy companies strategy also includes the planned retirement of coalfired generation resources if regulators determine that the retirement of coal generation facilities was not prudent they could prohibit the evergy companies from recovering or earning a return on the investments in those facilities that were prudent when the investments were originally made this concept is known as a stranded asset and generation retirements outside of those contemplated in the integrated resource plan increase the risk that regulators will disallow the recovery of otherwise prudent investments in addition the evergy companies may utilize legislative mechanisms known as securitization to facilitate the retirement of coalfired generation which will eliminate future returns on the investment that was originally made by the evergy companies in those coalfired generating facilities and reduce the evergys companies results of operations and financial position 

no assurance can be given that the evergy companies will be successful in implementing their strategy in a timely manner or at all and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial 

position and cash flows of the evergy companies and have an adverse impact on the price of evergy’s common stock 

the price of evergy common stock may experience volatility 

the price of evergy common stock may be volatile some of the factors that could affect the price of evergy common stock are evergys earnings the ability of the evergy companies to implement their strategic plan the ability of evergy to deploy capital actions by regulators and statements in the press or investment community about the evergy companies strategy earnings per share or growth prospects financial condition or results of operations negative perceptions or publicity from increasing scrutiny of environmental social and governance practices could also adversely impact evergys stock price also individuals or entities such as activist shareholders and special interest groups may seek to influence the evergy companies strategic plan or take other actions that could disrupt the evergy companies business financial results or operations and could adversely impact evergys stock price in addition the evergy companies operate almost exclusively in kansas and missouri and this concentration may increase exposure to risks arising from unique local or regional factors furthermore general market conditions and us economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of evergy including the covid19 pandemic may also affect evergys stock price for these reasons shareholders should not rely on historical trends in the price of evergy common stock to predict the future price of evergys common stock 

evergy has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results  

as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap evergy recorded a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet in connection with completion of the merger that resulted in the formation of evergy evergy assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment if goodwill is deemed to be impaired evergy may be required to incur noncash charges that could materially adversely affect its results of operations 

customer and weatherrelated risks 

changes in electricity consumption could have a material adverse effect on evergys results of operations financial position and cash flows 

change in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the consumption of energy by customers federal and state programs exist to influence the way customers use energy and regulators have mandates to promote energy efficiency conservation programs and customers level of participation in the programs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

technological advances energy efficiency and other energy conservation measures have reduced and will continue to reduce customer electricity consumption the evergy companies generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost selfgeneration and distributed generation technologies including microturbines wind turbines fuel cells and solar cells as well as those related to the storage of energy produced by these systems have become economically competitive with the manner and price at which the evergy companies sell electricity there is also a perception that generating or storing electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels increased adoption of these technologies could reduce electricity demand and the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered resulting in under recovery of the fixed costs of the evergy companies increased selfgeneration and the related use of net energy metering which allows selfgenerating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power could put upward price pressure on remaining customers if the evergy companies are unable to adjust to reduced electricity demand and increased selfgeneration and net energy metering their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions downturns or sluggishness in the economy or other factors may also adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

weather is a major driver of the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the evergy companies are subject to risks associated with climate change 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for and price of electricity the evergy companies are significantly impacted by seasonality and due to energy demand created by air conditioning load highest revenues are typically recorded in the third quarter unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales in addition severe weather and events including tornados snow fire rain flooding drought and ice storms can be destructive and cause outages and property damage that can result in increased expenses lower revenues and additional restoration costs storm reserves established by the evergy companies may be insufficient and rates may not be adjusted in a timely manner or at all to recover these costs additionally because many of the evergy companies generating stations utilize water for cooling low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations result in limited power production and require modifications to plant operations high water conditions can also impair planned deliveries of fuel to generating stations or otherwise adversely impact the ability of the evergy companies to operate these stations climate change may produce more frequent or severe weather events such as storms droughts or floods and could also impact the economic health of the evergy companies service territories an increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events or a deterioration in the economic health of evergys service territories could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

in addition policy legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce ghg emissions impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency could result in reduced sales and require significant costs to respond to such efforts these efforts could also result in the early retirement of generation facilities which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow recovery of investments that were prudent when originally made and included in rates the evergy companies have a goal to achieve netzero co 2 emissions by 2045 with an interim goal of a 70 reduction of co 2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 the trajectory and timing of reaching the goal could be impacted by many external factors including enabling technology developments the reliability of the power grid availability of transmission capacity and supportive energy policies and regulations and other factors any of the foregoing could adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the market prices of evergys common stock 

operational risks 

operational risks may adversely affect the evergy companies 

the operation of electric generation transmission distribution and information systems involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment aging infrastructure employee error or contractor or subcontractor failure problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental safety or other regulatory requirements fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions labor disputes difficulties with the implementation or operation of information systems transmission scheduling constraints and catastrophic events such as fires floods droughts explosions terrorism or acts of war severe weather pandemics or other similar occurrences many of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution resources are aged which increases the risk of unplanned outages reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense any equipment or system outage or constraint can among other things reduce sales increase costs and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics customer expectations and regulatory reliability and security requirements 

the evergy companies have general liability and property insurance to cover a portion of their facilities but such policies do not cover transmission or distribution systems are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage certain insurers are also choosing to limit their exposure to companies with coalfired generation which may result in increased premiums and reduced scope of coverage these and other operating events may reduce revenues or increase costs or both and may materially affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

physical and cybersecurity breaches criminal activity terrorist attacks acts of war and other disruptions to facilities or information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations expose the evergy companies or their customers or employees to a risk of loss expose the evergy companies to legal or regulatory liability and cause reputational and other harm 

the evergy companies rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity supply chain functions and the invoicing and collection of payments from customers the evergy companies also use information technology networks and systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements these networks and systems are in some cases owned or managed by thirdparty service providers in the ordinary course of business the evergy companies collect store and transmit sensitive data including operating information proprietary business information and personal information belonging to customers and employees 

the evergy companies information technology networks and infrastructure as well as the networks and infrastructure belonging to thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other unauthorized third parties error or malfeasance by employees contractors or service providers unintended consequences related to software or hardware upgrades additions or replacements malicious software code vulnerabilities in thirdparty software code telecommunication failures the lack of availability of qualified employees and contractors natural disasters or other catastrophic events or criminal activity terrorist attacks or acts of war driven in part by the covid19 pandemic the evergy companies have increased the use of technology to enable remoteworking arrangements which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities public reports have indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due in part to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which people interact with their information technology infrastructure 

the occurrence of any of these events could among other things impact the reliability or safety of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems and information systems result in the erasure of data or render the evergy companies equipment or the equipment of thirdparty service providers unusable impact the evergy companies ability to conduct business in the ordinary course reduce sales expose the evergy companies and their customers employees and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of information result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties damage the evergy companies reputation or otherwise harm the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows the evergy companies can provide no assurance that they will be able to identify and remediate all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remediated 

the evergy companies are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning cybersecurity and safeguarding their customer and business information for example nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of the bulk power system including both physical and cybersecurity and continually evaluates the necessity for updates and new requirements with which the evergy companies must comply the evergy companies are subject to recurring independent thirdparty audits with respect to adherence to these regulations and standards the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at nuclear power plants compliance with nerc and nrc rules and standards and rules and standards promulgated by other regulatory agencies from time to time or future legislation will increase the evergy companies compliance costs and their exposure to the potential risk of violations of these rules standards or future legislation which includes potential financial penalties furthermore the noncompliance by other utilities subject to similar regulations or the occurrence of a serious security event at other utilities could result in increased regulation or oversight both of which could increase the evergy companies costs and adversely impact their financial results 

additionally the evergy companies cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or malicious attack may have on the energy industry in general the electric utility industry both within the united states and internationally has experienced physical and cybersecurity attacks on energy infrastructure such as power plants substations and related assets in the past and there will likely be more attacks in the future geopolitical matters 

including terrorist attacks and acts of war may increase the likelihood of such attacks the evergy companies have been subject to attempted cyber attacks from time to time and will likely continue to be subject to such attempted attacks but these prior attacks have not had a material impact on their operations however because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies in the future the evergy companies facilities and systems could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks the effects of such attacks could include disruption to the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution and information systems or to the electrical grid in general reduced sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage furthermore although the evergy companies maintain information security risk insurance coverage such insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved 

the evergy companies business is capital intensive and includes significant construction projects the risks of any capital project include actual costs may exceed estimated costs regulators may disallow limit or delay the recovery of all or part of the cost of or a return on a capital project increased inflation may render previously estimated costs to be inaccurate risks associated with the capital and credit markets to fund projects delays in receiving or failure to receive necessary permits approvals and other regulatory authorizations unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts inadequate availability or increased cost of labor or materials including commodities such as steel copper and aluminum that may be subject to uncertain or increased tariffs inclement weather new or changed laws regulations and requirements including environmental and health and safety laws regulations and requirements and other events beyond the evergy companies control may occur that may materially affect the schedule cost and performance of these projects 

the evergy companies strategy includes a significant amount of planned capital investments the evergy companies ability to implement these investments depend in part on the availability of adequate internal and external resources such as employees and qualified contractors and the availability of materials in this regard the global covid19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of qualified labor which in turn has increased inflationary pressures 

these and other risks could cause the evergy companies to defer or limit capital expenditures materially increase the costs of capital projects delay the inservice dates of projects adversely affect the performance of the projects and require the purchase of electricity on the wholesale market at potentially more expensive prices until the projects are completed these risks may significantly affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce or to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact the evergy companies business and operations and adversely impact the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies workforce includes professional managerial and technical employees failure to attract and retain qualified talent successfully transition retirements with adequate replacements or source qualified contractors could impede the evergy companies strategy andor adversely impact the evergy companies ability to execute on their strategy for example certain skills such as those related to construction maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply evergy competes for qualified employees with these skills on a national level 

in addition covid19 vaccination and testing mandates could result in employee or contractor labor disruptions and complying with any mandates and managing any related labor disruptions could have a significant adverse impact on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

a significant portion of the evergy companies workforce is represented by five local unions of the ibew and one local union of the ugsoa the evergy companies currently have three labor agreements that expire in 2024 and three labor agreements currently under negotiation that have expired and are operating under an extension a 

failure to successfully negotiate these collective bargaining agreements could result in labor disruptions and have a significant adverse impact on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies strategic plan includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coalfired generation the evergy companies will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement the evergy companies strategy and may need to retrain or reskill certain employees to support the evergy companies longterm objectives a failure to attract and retain qualified employees retrain or reskill existing employees and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the evergy companies are exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit which could adversely impact the evergy companies business and financial results 

evergy indirectly owns 94 of wolf creek with evergy kansas south and evergy metro each owning 47 of the nuclear plant the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities including wolf creek in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines shut down the facilities or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved additionally the noncompliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry such events could increase wolf creeks costs and impact the financial results of the evergy companies or result in a shutdown of wolf creek 

an extended outage of wolf creek whether resulting from nrc action an incident at the plant or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in the event replacement power and other costs are not recovered through rates or insurance if a longterm outage occurred the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base wolf creek commenced operations in 1985 and the age of wolf creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs 

on an annual basis evergy kansas south and evergy metro are required to contribute money to taxqualified trusts that were established to pay for decommissioning costs at the end of the units life the amount of contributions varies depending on estimates of decommissioning expenses and projected return on trust assets if the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated evergy kansas south and evergy metro could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates 

the evergy companies are also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit including but not limited to i potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit ii the storage handling disposal and potential release by accident through thirdparty actions or otherwise of radioactive materials and iii uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units evergy kansas south and evergy metro are also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments subject to a cap per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage 

in addition wolf creek is reliant on a sole supplier for fuel and related services the supplier has in the past been the subject of chapter 11 reorganization proceedings and an extended outage of wolf creek could occur if the supplier is not able to perform under its contracts with wolf creek switching to another supplier could take an extended amount of time and would require nrc approval an extended outage at wolf creek could affect the amount of wolf creek investment included in customer rates and could have a material impact on the evergy companies financial results 

the structure of the regional power market in which the evergy companies operate could have an adverse effect on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are members of the spp regional transmission organization and each has transferred operational authority but not ownership of their transmission facilities to the spp the spps integrated marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time the spps rules are primarily designed to provide for maximum costeffectiveness but in certain respects the rules also provide preferential treatment for certain resources based on public policy initiatives such as increasing the deployment of renewable generation if evergy kansas centrals evergy metros or evergy missouri wests generating resources are not dispatched each could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales 

the evergy companies strategic plan includes adding a significant amount of renewable generation transmission constraints and delays in the transmission planning and construction processes could impair the ability of the evergy companies to sell and transmit electricity generated by these renewable generation facilities which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the evergy companies 

in addition the rules governing the various regional power markets including the spp may change from time to time and such changes could impact the costs and revenues of the evergy companies 

litigation risks 

the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their respective businesses the outcome of these matters cannot be determined nor in many cases can the liability that could potentially result from each case be reasonably estimated the liability that the evergy companies may incur with respect to any of these cases may be in excess of amounts currently accrued and insured against with respect to such matters and could adversely impact the financial results for the evergy companies 

covid19 risks 

the spread of covid19 and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could continue to negatively affect the evergy companies business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the way that the evergy companies conduct their operations and could adversely impact their results of operations financial condition and cash flows further the spread of covid19 has resulted in efforts to contain the virus such as quarantines restrictions on travel closures and reduced operations of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions the pandemic along with the efforts to contain the virus has caused and could continue to cause an economic slowdown or recession result in significant disruptions or reductions in various public commercial or industrial activities cause employee absences and contractor or third party service provider disruptions which could interfere with the evergy companies operations or the operations of their customers 

the covid19 pandemic has altered electricity usage patterns including an overall reduction in demand and shifting usage away from customers with relatively higher load requirements such as industrial and commercial customers toward customers with relatively lower load requirements such as residential customers these changes in electricity usage patterns and the extent to which some of these shifts could become longterm or permanent could result in a significant decrease in the evergy companies sales of electricity 

the evergy companies have also incurred and will continue to incur expenses related to monitoring the covid19 pandemic and modifying operations in response to the pandemic in july 2020 the kcc authorized evergy kansas central and evergy metro to record to a regulatory asset all net incremental costs incurred with respect to their kansas operations associated with the covid19 pandemic for consideration in their next kansas rate cases which are expected to be completed no later than the end of 2023 additionally the kcc order stated 

that the kcc will also consider granting the recovery of evergy kansas centrals and evergy metros lost revenues associated with the covid19 pandemic as part of their next kansas rate cases in january 2021 the mpsc authorized evergy metro and evergy missouri west to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred between march 1 2020 and march 31 2021 associated with the covid19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases evergy metro and evergy missouri west can petition the mpsc to extend the period subject to the accounting authority order aao notwithstanding the foregoing regulators might not allow for recovery of these amounts in a timely manner or at all in addition evergy metro and evergy missouri west utilize pisa in missouri which requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following evergy metros and evergy missouri wests last general rate case these and other factors may result in underrecovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment or both 

the evergy companies have also temporarily implemented policies and in the future may implement additional policies that are intended to ease the financial burden of the pandemic on customers such as temporarily extending payment options and offering incentives for customer payments on overdue balances as well as the elimination of late payment fees and disconnections for nonpayment there is also the possibility that legislation or regulations could be enacted at the federal or state level that would further restrict the evergy companies ability to discontinue service to customers in the event of nonpayment or to collect amounts owed from customers for service provided these measures could result in an overall increase in customer nonpayment or delay in the timely receipt of customer payments which could result in a significant increase in the evergy companies credit loss expense or significant decrease in operating cash flows 

evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west sell retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors as a source of liquidity these arrangements include covenants that limit the extent to which accounts receivable can be delinquent or unpaid a decrease in the amount of or a delay in receiving customer collections due to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could absent a waiver or amendment result in a breach of these accounts receivable financing arrangements and require the evergy companies to repay any outstanding loans to the extent that the evergy companies experience lower electric sales they may not have sufficient eligible receivables to maximize their borrowing capacity under their receivables sales facilities or could be required to repay additional portions of their borrowings under the facilities 

the evergy companies are planning to make significant capital expenditures and they regularly conduct maintenance on their facilities the pandemic could disrupt the supply chains that provide services and equipment to the evergy companies as part of their capital expenditures or maintenance efforts if the evergy companies supply chains are disrupted the evergy companies may be unable to perform necessary maintenance which could result in increased costs as the evergy companies implement contingency plans to allow them to continue to operate supply chain interruptions may also exacerbate inflationary pressures increase the cost of maintenance and capital expenditures or result in the delay or cancellation of planned projects any of which could have a material adverse impact on the evergy companies results of operations 

the evergy companies also have a significant amount of nols tax credits and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on their balance sheets these tax benefits have various expiration dates and other limitations on the extent to which the benefits can be realized the evergy companies regularly assess their future ability to utilize tax benefits to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary a significant reduction in the evergy companies taxable income due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could require the evergy companies to record a valuation allowance against a portion of those tax assets which in turn reduces earnings and the evergy companies may in general not be able to utilize these tax benefits 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has changed the way the evergy companies operate and has increased the use of technology to enable remoteworking arrangements which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities public reports have also indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due in part to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which employees and third parties interact with the evergy companies information technology infrastructure a successful attack against the evergy companies or cyberattacks to interconnected utilities municipalities others or widespread attacks to the utility industry could result in disruption to the evergy 

companies generation transmission and distribution and information systems or to the electrical grid in general reduce sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the us economy furthermore insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses 

any of these circumstances or other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect customer demand or revenues impact the ability of the evergy companies suppliers vendors or contractors to perform or cause other unpredictable events which could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies

from time to time evergy makes limited equity investments in earlystage energy solution companies these investments have historically not had a significant impact on evergys results of operations in october 2021 an equity investment in which evergy held a minority stake through an initial investment of 37 million was acquired through a transaction involving a special purpose acquisition company spac as a result of its equity investment in the company that was acquired in the spac transaction evergy received shares of the resulting public company upon the closing of the transaction which are subject to a restriction on sale for 150 days evergy recorded a 277 million unrealized gain in the fourth quarter of 2021 for the conversion of its shares into the newly formed public company and based on the closing share price as of december 31 2021 adjusted to reflect the restriction on the sale of the shares the fair value of evergys investment is largely dependent on the performance of the new public companys stock which is subject to significant market volatility and also affected by the restriction on sale of the shares until march 2022 when the restriction expires evergy uses adjusted earnings nongaap and adjusted eps nongaap to evaluate earnings and eps without the gains or losses related to equity investments which are subject to a restriction on sale that can create period to period volatility s ee nongaap measures within this executive summary for additional information 

lec unit 4 securitization 

in april 2021 the state of kansas passed the utility financing and securitization act ufsa which allows certain public utilities including evergy kansas central and evergy metro to securitize utility assets in order to recover energy transition costs relating to the early retirement of certain generating assets to recover the energy transition costs through securitization as allowed in the ufsa a public utility must obtain a predetermination order from the kcc finding that the retirement of the subject generation facility is reasonable upon the receipt of a successful predetermination order the public utility must then file an application with the kcc for a financing order to issue securitized bonds to recover the energy transition costs the ufsa also allows the pursuit of securitization to help finance qualified extraordinary expenses such as fuel costs incurred during extreme weather events 

in september 2021 evergy kansas central filed a predetermination request with the kcc for the ratemaking principles and treatment related to its planned investment in approximately 190 mw of solar generation and the planned retirement of coalfired lec unit 4 and related coalhandling facilities for lec units 4 and 5 both of which are expected to occur between december 2023 and the first half of 2024 in february 2022 evergy kansas central withdrew its predetermination request with the kcc in order to finalize definitive documentation associated with the solar investment and to develop additional information to enable the kcc to evaluate its predetermination request evergy kansas central anticipates refiling its predetermination request including this additional information later in 2022 

if the kcc finds that evergy kansas centrals planned retirement of lec unit 4 and investment in 190 mw of solar generation is prudent as part of a predetermination request evergy kansas central then plans to file an application with the kcc for a financing order authorizing the issuance of securitized bonds to recover energy transition costs associated with the retirement of lec unit 4 and the related coalhandling facilities for lec units 4 and 5 

february 2021 winter weather event 

in february 2021 much of the central and southern united states including the service territories of the evergy companies experienced a significant winter weather event that resulted in extremely cold temperatures over a multiday period february 2021 winter weather event the february 2021 winter weather event resulted in an increase in the demand for natural gas used by the e vergy companies for generating electricity and also contributed to the limited availability of other generation resources including coal and renewables within the spp integrated marketplace as part of the february 2021 winter weather event evergy incurred natural gas and purchased power costs net of wholesale revenues of 3655 million this 3655 million of net fuel and purchased power costs was primarily driven by 2964 million of costs at evergy missouri west and 1339 million of costs at evergy kansas central partially offset by 648 million of net wholesale revenues at evergy metro the amount of purchased power costs incurred by the evergy companies during the february 2021 winter weather event is subject to resettlement activity and further review by the spp this review and any subsequent resettlement activity could 

result in increases or decreases to the final amount of purchased power costs incurred by the evergy companies during the february 2021 winter weather event and these changes could be material 

as of december 31 2021 the evergy companies have deferred substantially all of the fuel and purchased power costs net of wholesale revenues related to the february 2021 winter weather event to a regulatory asset or liability pursuant to their fuel recovery mechanisms and an emergency aao issued by the kcc in february 2021 further in june 2021 evergy metro and evergy missouri west filed a joint request for an aao with the mpsc regarding the deferral and subsequent recovery or refund of the february 2021 winter weather event amounts while the evergy companies expect to recover substantially all of any increased fuel and purchased power costs related to the february 2021 winter weather event from customers the timing of the cost recovery could be delayed or spread over a longer than typical recovery timeframe by the kcc or the mpsc to help moderate monthly customer bill impacts given the extraordinary nature of the february 2021 winter weather event 

the evergy companies also engage in limited nonregulated energy marketing activities in various regional power markets that have historically not had a significant impact on the evergy companies results of operations these energy marketing margins are recorded net in operating revenues on the evergy companies statements of income and comprehensive income as a result of the elevated market prices experienced in regional power markets across the central and southern united states driven by the february 2021 winter weather event discussed above evergy and evergy kansas central recorded 945 million of energy marketing margins in 2021 related to the february 2021 winter weather event primarily driven by activities in the electric reliability council of texas ercot

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on evergys results of operations and financial position management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of evergys results of operations and financial position management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the evergy board 

pensions 

evergy incurs significant costs in providing noncontributory defined pension benefits the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 

pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age life expectancies compensation levels and employment periods earnings on plan assets the level of contributions made to the plan and plan amendments in addition pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 

the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weightedaverage of longterm returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan the assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation these assumptions updated annually at the measurement date are based on managements best estimates and judgment however material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 

the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 05 increase or a 05 decrease in key actuarial assumptions for evergys qualified pension plans each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only 



pension expense for evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the kcc and mpsc the orders allow the difference between pension costs under gaap and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds as appropriate 

in 2021 evergys pension expense was 1537 million under gaap and 1710 million for ratemaking the impact on 2022 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on gaap pension costs under the evergy companies rate agreements any increase or decrease in gaap pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or 

liability for future ratemaking treatment see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions 

market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan it is difficult to predict future pension costs changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions 

revenue recognition 

evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by evergy unbilled revenues are recorded for kwh usage in the period following the customers billing cycle to the end of the month this estimate is based on net system kwh usage less actual billed kwhs evergys estimated unbilled kwhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates evergys unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand weather line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the balance of unbilled receivables for evergy as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers 

management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc kcc or ferc in evergys rate case filings decisions in other regulatory proceedings including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to evergy and changes in laws and regulations if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations evergys continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules in the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of evergys operations the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided additionally these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairments of assets and goodwill 

longlived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under gaap 

accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill to identify potential impairment in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value evergys consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis the annual impairment test for the 23366 million of goodwill from the great plains energy and evergy kansas central merger was conducted as of may 1 2021 the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill as a result there was no impairment of goodwill 

the determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies the results of the two techniques 

were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit which involves a significant amount of management judgment 

the discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the kcc and mpsc and aftertax cost of debt estimated future cash flows are based on evergys internal business plan which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future such as the outcome of future rate filings future approved rates of return on equity anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 

the market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by managements selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry changes in results of peer companies selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the evergy reporting unit 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the assetliability approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses capital losses and tax credit carryforwards evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in evergys consolidated financial statements or tax returns actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities this process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations 

evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets concurrent with the recognition of the liability the estimated cost of the aro incurred at the time the related longlived assets were either acquired placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets the recording of aros for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability 

evergy initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 94 indirect share retire wind generating facilities dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills among other items aro refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity in determining evergys aros assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence the results of these assumptions are discounted using creditadjusted riskfree rates carfr the carfr is determined as the current us treasury bonds rates 

corresponding to the period of expected settlement activities and is adjusted for the associated bond rates evergy would be charged to borrow for the specific time period any change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on evergys aros reflected on its consolidated balance sheets 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 evergy had recorded aros of 9601 million and 9419 million respectively see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding evergys aros 

evergy results of operations   

evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation fuel costs weather customer behavior and demand the economy and competitive forces 

substantially all of evergys revenues are subject to state or federal regulation this regulation has a significant impact on the price the evergy companies charge for electric service evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending both operating and capital within the frameworks established by its regulators 

wholesale revenues are impacted by among other factors demand cost and availability of fuel and purchased power price volatility available generation capacity transmission availability and weather 

the evergy companies use coal uranium and gas for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through renewable power purchase agreements or on the open market the prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of power purchases can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply demand weather and the broader economic environment evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west have fuel recovery mechanisms in their kansas and missouri jurisdictions as applicable that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding 

weather significantly affects the amount of electricity that evergys customers use as electricity sales are seasonal as summer peaking utilities the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the evergy companies hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand especially among residential and commercial customers and to a lesser extent industrial customers mild weather reduces customer demand 

energy efficiency investments by customers and the evergy companies also can affect the demand for electric service through meeia evergy metro and evergy missouri west offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their missouri retail customers and recover program costs throughput disincentive and as applicable certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism 

the evergy companies taxes other than income taxes of which property taxes are a significant component can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including changes in taxable values and property tax rates evergy kansas central and evergy metros kansas jurisdiction have property tax surcharges that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding 

the following table summarizes evergys comparative results of operations 



evergy utility gross margin and mwh sales 

utility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with gaap utility gross margin as used by the evergy companies is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the spp for network transmission costs expenses for fuel and purchased power costs offset by wholesale sales margin are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms as a result changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income in addition spp network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by spp members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the spp rto as with fuel and purchased power costs changes in spp network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which the evergy companies reflect spp revenues and expenses 

management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the evergy companies operations across periods because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the evergy board utility gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for income from operations which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with gaap the evergy companies definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies

• a 322 million increase related to the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the second quarter of 2020 due to the change in the kansas corporate income tax rate 

• a 151 million increase due to higher pretax income in 2021 

• a 50 million increase due to lower wind and other income tax credits in 2021 primarily driven by the expiration of production tax credits at the spearville 2 wind facility in the fourth quarter of 2020 and lower research and development tax credits in 2021 and 

• a 28 million increase due to higher nondeductible officer compensation in 2021 partially offset by 

• a 141 million decrease as a result of the state of kansas exempting certain public utilities including evergy metro from kansas corporate income tax beginning in january 2021 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the change in the kansas corporate income tax rate 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

in the ordinary course of business evergy faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include business legal operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis see part i item 1a risk factors and part ii item 7 mda for further discussion of risk factors 

the evergy companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply interest rates and security prices commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energyrelated products credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates in addition evergys investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and nonqualified retirement benefits as well as limited equity investments in earlystage energy solution companies give rise to security price risk 

management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on evergys operating results during the ordinary course of business the evergy companies hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation though management believes its risk management practices are effective it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk evergy could experience losses which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position due to many factors including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets regulatorydriven market rule changes andor bankruptcy or nonperformance of customers or counterparties andor failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 

hedging strategies 

from time to time evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies derivative instruments such as futures forward contracts swaps or options derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 

commodity price risk 

the evergy companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to limited nonregulated energy marketing activities these activities expose the evergy companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energyrelated products exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume as well as the wholesale market prices received by the evergy companies generation resources and the wholesale market prices paid to procure power to serve customer load or satisfy regulatory or contractual obligations customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels evergys exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the costbased regulation of its regulated operations in kansas and missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through fuel recovery mechanisms while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results 

interest rate risk 

evergy manages interest rate risk and short and longterm liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt to a percentage of total debt diversifying maturity dates and from time to time entering into interest rate hedging transactions at december 31 2021 28 of evergys longterm debt was variable rate debt shortterm borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt that were exposed to interest rate risk evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt shortterm borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100basispoint change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 

at december 31 2021 evergy had 18153 million of variable rate debt shortterm borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt a 100basispoint change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact evergys income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately 161 million 

credit risk 

evergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure the credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by evergys large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates the evergy companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms such as letters of credit when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure 

investment risk 

evergy maintains trust funds as required by the nrc to fund its 94 share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain nonqualified retirement benefits as of december 31 2021 these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on evergys balance sheet the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors 

as nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for these securities as an offset to its regulatory liability for decommissioning wolf creek and as such fluctuations in the value of these securities do not impact earnings a significant decline in the value of pension or nonqualified retirement assets could require evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods in addition a decline in the fair value of these plan assets in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by evergy could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by evergy 

in addition to evergys investments in debt and equity securities in its nuclear decommissioning and pension trusts evergy also makes limited equity investments in earlystage energy solution companies these limited equity investments are often in privatelyowned companies that do not have reasonably determinable fair values however from time to time these investments could have changes in fair value as a result of acquisitions mergers initial public offerings or observable market transactions for similar investments evergy typically seeks to liquidate its position in these companies as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an exit event such as an acquisition or initial public offering including after the expiration of any related lockup provisions which serves to largely mitigate any ongoing market risk related to the investments at december 31 2021 evergy had a 314 million investment including a 277 million unrealized gain in an earlystage energy solution company that was acquired and became a publicly traded company through a transaction involving a spac in the fourth quarter of 2021 this investment is currently subject to a lockup provision on its sale until march 2022 and is exposed to significant equity price risk a 50 decline in the stock price of this investment would impact evergys income before income taxes by approximately 14 million evergy uses adjusted earnings nongaap and adjusted eps nongaap to evaluate earnings and eps without the gains or losses related to equity investments which are subject to a restriction on sale that can create period to period volatility s ee nongaap measures within part ii item 7 mda  executive summary for additional information

competition 

missouri and kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model as a result the evergy companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a writeoff of certain regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory this competition primarily occurs within the spp integrated marketplace in which evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are participants this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time for maximum regional costeffectiveness 

the spp integrated marketplace is similar to other regional transmission organization rto or independent system operator iso markets currently operating in other regions of the united states

evergys total capacity by fuel type including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements is detailed in the table below 



a mws are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility includes owned generating capacity of 579 mws and longterm power purchase agreements of approximately 3760 mws of wind generation that expire from 2028 through 2048 see item 2 properties for additional information 

b includes a longterm power purchase agreement for approximately 60 mws of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023 

evergys projected peak summer demand for 2021 is approximately 10300 mws evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for 2021 with its existing generation assets and power purchases see transforming evergys generation fleet for further information regarding evergys longterm strategy with regards to its generating assets and power purchases

the evergy companies are committed to a longterm strategy to reduce co 2 emissions in a costeffective and reliable manner in 2020 evergy achieved a reduction of co 2 emissions of approximately 50 from 2005 levels and announced a goal to achieve an 80 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 in august 2020 evergy also announced a fiveyear sustainability transformation plan stp which seeks to optimize and enhance value creation for stakeholders and has the potential to reduce co 2 emissions by as much as 85 by 2030 compared to 2005 levels the stp includes steps that would expedite co 2 emission reductions by pursuing constructive legislative and regulatory recovery mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of coalfired generation and expansion of evergys wind and solar footprint while maintaining reliability the pace of co 2 emission reductions will ultimately be defined by continued collaboration with stakeholders as part of evergys triennial integrated resource plan further the trajectory and timing for reaching this goal could be impacted by political legal and regulatory actions and applicable technology developments see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda  executive summary  strategy for additional information regarding the stp 

public attention is currently focused on transitioning to a low carbon future including reducing ghg emissions and closing coalfired generating units diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits for example because renewable generation is intermittent diversity of baseload generation including a mix of coal and natural gas has helped to maintain a consistent availability of power in addition the evergy companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the evergy companies to include in rates the evergy companies use a triennial integrated resource plan which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity to inform the manner in which they supply electricity the integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand fuel prices transmission improvements new generating capacity cost of environmental compliance integration of renewables energy storage energy 

efficiency and demand response initiatives strategies that the evergy companies are pursuing to reduce emissions include 

• retiring fossil fuel generation 

• developing renewable energy facilities 

• collaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources and 

• investing in customer energy efficiency programs 

since 2005 the evergy companies have added over 4400 mws of renewables while retiring more than 2400 mws of fossil generation the evergy companies are also committed to transparency on its website wwwevergycom evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental social and governance matters including information related to emissions waste and water the contents of the website including reports and documents contained therein are not incorporated into this filing

 item 1a risk factors 

utility regulatory risks 

prices are established by regulators and may not be sufficient to result in a recovery of costs or provide for a return on investment 

the prices that the ferc kcc and mpsc authorize the utility subsidiaries of evergy to charge significantly influence the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in general utilities are allowed to recover in customer rates costs that were prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on invested capital there can be no assurance however that regulators will determine costs to have been prudently incurred further the amounts approved by the regulators may not be sufficient to allow for a recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments also amounts that were approved by regulators may be appealed modified limited or eliminated by subsequent regulatory or legislative actions a failure to recover costs or earn a reasonable return on invested capital could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of evergy and its utility subsidiaries 

the evergy companies are also exposed to costrecovery shortfalls due to the inherent regulatory lag in the ratesetting process this is because utility rates are generally based on historical information and except for certain situations where regulators allow for recovery of expenses through use of a formula that tracks costs are not subject to adjustment between rate cases in connection with the merger evergy kansas central and evergy metro agreed to a fiveyear base rate moratorium in kansas beginning in december 2018 in addition effective as of january 1 2019 evergy metro and evergy missouri west elected into plantin service accounting pisa which by law requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following evergy metros and evergy missouri wests last general rate case and limits the extent to which prices can increase thereafter these and other factors may result in underrecovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment or both 

failure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings reduced access to capital markets increased financing costs lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures in response to competitive economic political legislative public perception and regulatory pressures evergys utility subsidiaries may be subject to rate moratoriums rate refunds limits on rate increases lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions including phasein plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period for the benefit of customers any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of the evergy companies 

legislative and regulatory requirements may increase costs and result in compliance penalties 

ferc the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and spp have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements such as vegetation management standards facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards in addition evergy is also subject to health safety and other requirements enacted by the occupational safety and health administration the department of transportation the department of labor and other federal and state agencies as discussed more fully below the evergy companies are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as well as laws and regulations related to nuclear power generation the costs of complying with existing new or modified regulations standards and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies furthermore regulatory changes could result in operational changes that increase costs or adversely impact the evergy companies prospects in addition failure to meet quality of service reliability cybersecurity critical infrastructure protection operational or other standards and requirements could expose the evergy companies to penalties additional 

compliance costs or adverse rate consequences any of which could have a material adverse impact on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

environmental risks 

costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including those relating to ghg emissions are significant and may adversely impact operations and financial results 

the evergy companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal state and local environmental laws regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality waste management and hazardous substance disposal protected natural resources such as wetlands endangered species and other protected wildlife and health and safety see item 1 business  environmental matters and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

compliance with these laws regulations and requirements requires significant capital and operating resources and the failure to comply could result in substantial fines injunctive relief and other sanctions in addition there is a risk of lawsuits alleging violations of environmental laws regulations or requirements claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other relief 

environmental permits are subject to periodic renewal which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits new facilities or modifications of existing facilities may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits delays in the environmental permitting process public opposition and challenges denials of permit applications limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects and thus materially adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in addition compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements could alter the way assets are managed which in turn could result in retiring assets earlier than expected recording asset retirement obligations aros or having a regulator disallow recovery of costs that had been prudently incurred in connection with those assets 

costs of compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements or fines penalties or negative lawsuit outcomes if not recovered in rates from customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

financial risks 

financial market disruptions or declines in the evergy companies credit ratings may increase financing costs and limit access to the credit markets which may adversely affect liquidity and financial results 

the evergy companies rely on funds from operations and access to the capital and credit markets to fund capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity disruption in capital or credit markets increases in interest rates deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which the evergy companies rely credit rating downgrades a decrease in the market price of evergys common stock or a decrease or disappearance in the demand for debt securities issued by the evergy companies or subsidiaries could have material adverse effects on the evergy companies these effects could include among others reduced access to capital and increased cost of borrowed funds and collateral requirements dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other postretirement benefit plan funding requirements reduced ability to pay dividends rate case disallowance of costs of capital reductions in or delays of capital expenditures and limitations in the ability of evergy to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 

the stp includes an increase in targeted capital investments to enhance the customer experience improve reliability and resiliency and improve efficiency which are expected to be funded with cash flows from operations and debt if cash flows from operations are lower than expected additional debt will be required to fund the investments which in turn may create pressure on the evergy companies credit ratings or result in a ratings downgrade and increase their cost of capital further evergy kansas central and evergy metro have outstanding taxexempt bonds that may be put back to the respective issuer at the option of the holders which could adversely 

impact liquidity in addition market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on evergys lenders suppliers and other counterparties or customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations 

evergy is a holding company and relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations 

evergy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its direct subsidiaries particularly evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west evergys subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide evergy with funds the ability of evergys subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions and accordingly evergys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the earnings and cash flows capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries as well as regulatory factors financial covenants general business conditions and other matters 

in addition the evergy companies are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends under the federal power act evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings each of evergy metro and evergy missouri west has committed to missouri regulators to not pay dividends to evergy if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services each of evergy kansas central and evergy metro has committed to kansas regulators to not pay dividends to evergy if i the payment would result in an increase in the utilitys debt level excluding shortterm debt and debt due within one year above 60 percent of its total capitalization absent approval from the kcc or ii if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services under various debt agreements the evergy companies are also required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 065 to 100 which could restrict the amount of dividends the evergy companies are permitted to pay evergy cannot guarantee dividends will be paid in the future or that if paid dividends will satisfy announced targets or investor expectations or be paid with the same frequency as in the past 

in addition from time to time evergy may guarantee debt obligations of its subsidiaries under the financing agreements to which evergy is a party a guarantee of debt may be considered indebtedness for purposes of complying with financial covenants that dictate the extent to which evergy can borrow money and any guarantee payments could adversely affect evergys liquidity and ability to service its own debt obligations 

increasing costs associated with defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans health care plans and other employee benefits could adversely affect evergys financial position and liquidity 

evergy maintains defined benefit retirement and other postretirement employee benefit plans for certain current and former employees the costs of these plans depend on a number of factors including the rates of return on plan assets the level and nature of the provided benefits discount rates the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels changes in benefit design changes in laws or regulations and the amount of any required or voluntary contributions to the plans the evergy companies have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans also if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels these plans experience adverse market returns on investments or interest rates fall required or voluntary contributions to the plans could be material in addition changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs returns on investments interest rates and other actuarial assumptions including projected retirements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased in recent years and may continue to rise in the future future legislative changes related to health care could also cause significant changes to benefit programs and costs the increasing costs associated with health care plans could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the evergy companies are subject to commodity and other risks associated with energy markets 

the evergy companies are required to maintain generation capacity that satisfies regulatory mandates and are obligated to provide power when required by the spp or pursuant to contractual obligations although the evergy companies generally have regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power 

necessary to satisfy these requirements regulatory or legislative actions could limit eliminate or delay recovery of these expenses after the expenses have been incurred 

the evergy companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to limited energy marketing activities and the management of thirdparty generation facilities these activities expose the evergy companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energyrelated products as well credit exposure to their counterparties exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the availability and cost of fuel and power that the evergy companies may purchase on the wholesale markets to satisfy their regulatory or contractual obligations the ability or effectiveness of strategies utilized by the evergy companies to hedge these risks the extent to which the evergy companies may be required to post collateral for the benefit of third parties and the risk that counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations to the evergy companies market volatility can increase or create unanticipated risks regional transmission organizations and independent system operators may also retroactively reprice transactions following execution 

subject to certain regulatory constraints the evergy companies use derivative instruments such as transmission congestion rights tcrs swaps options futures and forwards to manage commodity and financial risks losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts if a counterparty fails to perform or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or the use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts the evergy companies cannot assure that their risk management practices will be effective or will mitigate all risks 

the results of operations financial position and liquidity of the evergy companies could be materially adversely affected if the evergy companies fail to recover or experience a delay in the recovery of fuel and purchased power expenses if the evergy companies fail to adequately hedge or mitigate commodity or energy market risks if the evergy companies are required to provide collateral in amounts greater than planned if energy marketing transactions are retroactively repriced or if counterparties fail to fulfill obligations to the evergy companies 

tax legislation and an inability to utilize tax credits could adversely impact results of operations financial position and liquidity 

tax laws and regulations can adversely affect among other things financial results liquidity credit ratings and the valuation of assets such as deferred income tax assets the evergy companies regularly assess their ability to utilize tax benefits including those in the form of net operating loss nol tax credit and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on its balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary a reduction in or disallowance of these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the evergy companies 

additionally changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire could have an adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and liquidity of the evergy companies for example prior to the us presidential election president biden proposed increasing the us corporate income tax rate from 21 to 28 and imposing an alternative minimum tax amt on book income among other things and these or similar proposals if enacted into law could impact the evergy companies effective tax rate in addition the evergy companies construct and operate renewable energy facilities that generate tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations the amount of tax credits is dependent on several factors including the amount of electricity produced and the applicable tax credit rate a variety of factors including transmission constraints the ability to timely complete construction of renewable energy facilities adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment could significantly reduce these tax credits which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the evergy companies 

the anticipated benefits of the evergy companies strategy may not be realized 

the stp includes planned reductions in operating and maintenance expense and planned increases in capital investments the stp also includes pursuing statutory and regulatory mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of 

coalfired generation and expansion of the evergy companies wind and solar footprint if regulators determine that the retirement of coal generation facilities was not prudent they could prohibit the evergy companies from recovering or earning a return on the investments in those facilities that were prudent when the investments were originally made this concept is known as a stranded asset and generation retirements outside of those contemplated in the integrated resource plan increase the risk that regulators will disallow the recovery of otherwise prudent investments 

see part ii item 7 mda  executive summary  strategy for additional information regarding the stp the risks described elsewhere in item 1a – risk factors apply to the stp no assurance can be given that the evergy companies will be successful in implementing their strategy in a timely manner or at all and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and have an adverse impact on the price of evergy’s common stock 

the price of evergy common stock may experience volatility 

the price of evergy common stock may be volatile some of the factors that could affect the price of evergy common stock are evergys earnings the ability of the evergy companies to implement their strategic plan the ability of evergy to deploy capital actions by regulators and statements in the press or investment community about the evergy companies strategy earnings per share or growth prospects financial condition or results of operations negative perceptions or publicity from increasing scrutiny of environmental social and governance practices could also adversely impact evergys stock price also individuals or entities such as activist shareholders and special interest groups may seek to influence the evergy companies strategic plan or take other actions that could disrupt the evergy companies business financial results or operations and could adversely impact evergys stock price in addition the evergy companies operate almost exclusively in kansas and missouri and this concentration may increase exposure to risks arising from unique local or regional factors furthermore general market conditions and us economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of evergy including the covid19 pandemic may also affect evergys stock price for these reasons shareholders should not rely on historical trends in the price of evergy common stock to predict the future price of evergys common stock 

evergy has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results  

as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap evergy recorded a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet in connection with completion of the merger that resulted in the formation of evergy evergy assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment if goodwill is deemed to be impaired evergy may be required to incur noncash charges that could materially adversely affect its results of operations 

customer and weatherrelated risks 

changes in electricity consumption could have a material adverse effect on evergys results of operations financial position and cash flows 

change in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the consumption of energy by customers federal and state programs exist to influence the way customers use energy and regulators have mandates to promote energy efficiency conservation programs and customers level of participation in the programs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

technological advances energy efficiency and other energy conservation measures have reduced and will continue to reduce customer electricity consumption the evergy companies generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost selfgeneration and distributed generation technologies including microturbines wind turbines fuel cells and solar cells as well as those related to the storage of energy produced by these systems have become economically competitive with the manner and price at which the evergy companies sell electricity there is also a perception that generating or storing electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels increased 

adoption of these technologies could reduce electricity demand and the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered resulting in under recovery of the fixed costs of the evergy companies increased selfgeneration and the related use of net energy metering which allows selfgenerating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power could put upward price pressure on remaining customers if the evergy companies are unable to adjust to reduced electricity demand and increased selfgeneration and net energy metering their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions downturns or sluggishness in the economy or other factors may also adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

weather is a major driver of the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the evergy companies are subject to risks associated with climate change 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for and price of electricity the evergy companies are significantly impacted by seasonality and due to energy demand created by air conditioning load highest revenues are typically recorded in the third quarter unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales in addition severe weather and events including tornados snow fire rain flooding and ice storms can be destructive and cause outages and property damage that can result in increased expenses lower revenues and additional restoration costs storm reserves established by the evergy companies may be insufficient and rates may not be adjusted in a timely manner or at all to recover these costs additionally because many of the evergy companies generating stations utilize water for cooling low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations result in limited power production and require modifications to plant operations high water conditions can also impair planned deliveries of fuel to generating stations or otherwise adversely impact the ability of the evergy companies to operate these stations climate change may produce more frequent or severe weather events such as storms droughts or floods and could also impact the economic health of the evergy companies service territories an increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events or a deterioration in the economic health of evergys service territories could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

in addition policy legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce ghg emissions impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency could result in reduced sales and require significant costs to respond to such efforts these efforts could also result in the early retirement of generation facilities which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow recovery of investments that were prudent when originally made the evergy companies announced a goal in 2020 to achieve an 80 reduction of co 2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 and the stp has the potential to reduce co 2 emissions by as much as 85 by 2030 compared to 2005 levels the trajectory and timing of the goal could be impacted by many external factors including national and state energy policies legal and regulatory matters stakeholder input into the evergy companies integrated resource plan the development deployment and advancement of relevant energy technologies and other factors any of the foregoing could adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the market prices of evergys common stock 

operational risks 

operational risks may adversely affect the evergy companies 

the operation of electric generation transmission distribution and information systems involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment aging infrastructure operator error or contractor or subcontractor failure problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental safety or other regulatory requirements fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions labor disputes difficulties with the implementation or operation of information systems transmission scheduling constraints and catastrophic events such as fires floods droughts explosions terrorism severe weather pandemics or other similar occurrences many of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution resources are aged which increases the risk of unplanned outages reduced 

generation output and higher maintenance expense any equipment or system outage or constraint can among other things reduce sales increase costs and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics customer expectations and regulatory reliability and security requirements 

the evergy companies have general liability and property insurance to cover a portion of their facilities but such policies do not cover transmission or distribution systems are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage 

these and other operating events may reduce revenues or increase costs or both and may materially affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

physical and cybersecurity breaches criminal activity terrorist attacks and other disruptions to facilities or information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations expose the evergy companies or their customers or employees to a risk of loss expose the evergy companies to legal or regulatory liability and cause reputational and other harm 

the evergy companies rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity supply chain functions and the invoicing and collection of payments from customers the evergy companies also use information technology networks and systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements these networks and systems are in some cases owned or managed by thirdparty service providers in the ordinary course of business the evergy companies collect store and transmit sensitive data including operating information proprietary business information and personal information belonging to customers and employees 

the evergy companies information technology networks and infrastructure as well as the networks and infrastructure belonging to thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other unauthorized third parties error or malfeasance by one or more employees or service providers software or hardware upgrades additions or replacements malicious software code telecommunication failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events the covid19 pandemic has changed the way the evergy companies operate and has increased the use of technology to enable remoteworking arrangements which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities public reports have indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due in part to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which employees and third parties interact with the evergy companies information technology infrastructure 

the occurrence of any of these events could among other things impact the reliability or safety of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems result in the erasure of data or render the evergy companies equipment or the equipment of thirdparty service providers unusable impact the evergy companies ability to conduct business in the ordinary course reduce sales expose the evergy companies and their customers employees and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of information and result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties damage the evergy companies reputation or otherwise harm their business the evergy companies can provide no assurance that they will be able to identify and remediate all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remediated 

the evergy companies are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of their security customer and business information for example nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updates and new requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at nuclear power plants compliance with nerc and nrc rules and standards and rules and standards promulgated by other regulatory agencies from time to time or future legislation will increase the evergy companies compliance costs 

and their exposure to the potential risk of violations of these rules standards or future legislation which includes potential financial penalties furthermore the noncompliance of other utilities with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious security event at other utilities could result in increased regulation or oversight both of which could increase the evergy companies costs and impact their financial results 

additionally the evergy companies cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or malicious attack may have on the energy industry in general the electric utility industry both within the united states and internationally has experienced physical and cybersecurity attacks on energy infrastructure such as power plants substations and related assets in the past and there will likely be more attacks in the future the evergy companies facilities and systems could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks the effects of such attacks could include disruption to the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general reduced sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the us economy furthermore insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the evergy companies results of operations or financial position 

the cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved 

the evergy companies business is capital intensive and includes significant construction projects the risks of any capital project include actual costs may exceed estimated costs regulators may disallow limit or delay the recovery of all or part of the cost of or a return on a capital project risks associated with the capital and credit markets to fund projects delays in receiving or failure to receive necessary permits approvals and other regulatory authorizations unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts inadequate availability or increased cost of labor or materials including commodities such as steel copper and aluminum that may be subject to uncertain or increased tariffs inclement weather new or changed laws regulations and requirements including environmental and health and safety laws regulations and requirements and other events beyond the evergy companies control may occur that may materially affect the schedule cost and performance of these projects 

the stp includes an increase in targeted capital investments the evergy companies ability to implement the investments contemplated in the stp depend in part on the availability of adequate internal and external resources such as employees and qualified contractors and the availability of materials in this regard the global covid19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of qualified labor 

these and other risks could cause the evergy companies to defer or limit capital expenditures materially increase the costs of capital projects delay the inservice dates of projects adversely affect the performance of the projects and require the purchase of electricity on the wholesale market at potentially more expensive prices until the projects are completed these risks may significantly affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact the evergy companies business and operations and adversely impact the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies workforce includes professional managerial and technical employees and a failure to attract and retain qualified talent or retirements without adequate replacements or adjustments to the evergy companies strategy could adversely impact the evergy companies ability to execute on their strategy for example certain skills such as those related to construction maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply and evergy competes for qualified employees with these skills on a national level 

a significant portion of the evergy companies workforce is represented by five local unions of the ibew and one local union of the ugsoa the collective bargaining agreements with the five ibew locals all expire in 2021 and the collective bargaining agreement with the ugsoa expires in 2022 a failure to successfully negotiate these collective bargaining agreements could result in a labor disruption and have a significant adverse impact on the evergy companies operations and results of operations 

the stp includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coalfired generation the evergy companies will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement the evergy companies strategy and may need to retrain or reskill certain employees to support the evergy companies longterm objectives a failure to attract and retain qualified employees retrain or reskill existing employees and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the evergy companies are exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit which could adversely impact the evergy companies business and financial results 

evergy indirectly owns 94 of wolf creek with evergy kansas south and evergy metro each owning 47 of the nuclear plant the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities including wolf creek in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines shut down the facilities or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved additionally the noncompliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry such events could increase wolf creeks costs and impact the financial results of the evergy companies or result in a shutdown of wolf creek 

an extended outage of wolf creek whether resulting from nrc action an incident at the plant or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in the event replacement power and other costs are not recovered through rates or insurance if a longterm outage occurred the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base wolf creek commenced operations in 1985 and the age of wolf creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs 

on an annual basis evergy kansas south and evergy metro are required to contribute money to taxqualified trusts that were established to pay for decommissioning costs at the end of the units life the amount of contributions varies depending on estimates of decommissioning expenses and projected return on trust assets if the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated evergy kansas south and evergy metro could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates 

the evergy companies are also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit including but not limited to i potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit ii the storage handling disposal and potential release by accident through thirdparty actions or otherwise of radioactive materials and iii uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units evergy kansas south and evergy metro are also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments subject to a cap per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage 

in addition wolf creek is reliant on a sole supplier for fuel and related services the supplier has in the past been the subject of chapter 11 reorganization proceedings and an extended outage of wolf creek could occur if the supplier is not able to perform under its contracts with wolf creek switching to another supplier could take an extended amount of time and would require nrc approval an extended outage at wolf creek could affect the amount of wolf creek investment included in customer rates and could have a material impact on the evergy companies financial results 

the structure of the regional power market in which the evergy companies operate could have an adverse effect on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are members of the spp regional transmission organization and each has transferred operational authority but not ownership of their transmission facilities to the spp the spps integrated marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run 

within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time the spps rules are primarily designed to provide for maximum costeffectiveness but in certain respects the rules also provide preferential treatment for certain resources based on public policy initiatives such as increasing the deployment of renewable generation if evergy kansas centrals evergy metros or evergy missouri wests generating resources are not dispatched each could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales 

the rules governing the various regional power markets including the spp may change from time to time and such changes could impact the costs and revenues of the evergy companies 

litigation risks 

the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their respective businesses the outcome of these matters cannot be determined nor in many cases can the liability that could potentially result from each case be reasonably estimated the liability that the evergy companies may incur with respect to any of these cases may be in excess of amounts currently accrued and insured against with respect to such matters and could adversely impact the financial results for the evergy companies 

covid19 risks 

the spread of covid19 and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could continue to negatively affect the evergy companies business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the way that the evergy companies conduct their operations and could adversely impact their results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity further the spread of covid19 has resulted in efforts to contain the virus such as quarantines restrictions on travel closures and reduced operations of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions the pandemic along with the efforts to contain the virus has caused and could continue to cause an economic slowdown or recession result in significant disruptions or reductions in various public commercial or industrial activities and cause employee absences which could interfere with the evergy companies operations or the operations of their customers 

the covid19 pandemic has altered electricity usage patterns including an overall reduction in demand and shifting usage away from customers with relatively higher load requirements such as industrial and commercial customers toward customers with relatively lower load requirements such as residential customers these changes in electricity usage patterns and the extent to which some of these shifts could become longterm or permanent could result in a significant decrease in the evergy companies sales of electricity 

the evergy companies have also incurred and will continue to incur expenses related to monitoring the covid19 pandemic and modifying operations in response to the pandemic in july 2020 the kcc authorized evergy kansas central and evergy metro to record to a regulatory asset all net incremental costs incurred with respect to their kansas operations associated with the covid19 pandemic for consideration in their next kansas rate cases which are expected to be completed no later than the end of 2023 additionally the kcc order stated that the kcc will also consider granting the recovery of evergy kansas centrals and evergy metros lost revenues associated with the covid19 pandemic as part of their next kansas rate cases in january 2021 the mpsc authorized evergy metro and evergy missouri west to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred between march 1 2020 and march 31 2021 associated with the covid19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases evergy metro and evergy missouri west can petition the mpsc to extend the period subject to the accounting authority order aao notwithstanding the foregoing regulators might not allow for recovery of these amounts in a timely manner or at all in addition evergy metro and evergy missouri west elected into plantin service accounting pisa in missouri effective as of january 1 2019 which by law requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following evergy metros and evergy missouri wests last 

general rate case these and other factors may result in underrecovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment or both 

the evergy companies have also temporarily implemented policies and in the future may implement additional policies that are intended to ease the financial burden of the pandemic on customers such as temporarily extending payment options and offering incentives for customer payments on overdue balances as well as the elimination of late payment fees and disconnections for nonpayment there is also the possibility that legislation or regulations could be enacted at the federal or state level that would further restrict the evergy companies ability to discontinue service to customers in the event of nonpayment or to collect amounts owed from customers for service provided these measures could result in an overall increase in customer nonpayment or delay in the timely receipt of customer payments which could result in a significant increase in the evergy companies credit loss expense or significant decrease in operating cash flows 

evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west sell retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors as a source of liquidity these arrangements include covenants that limit the extent to which accounts receivable can be delinquent or unpaid a decrease in the amount of or a delay in receiving customer collections due to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could absent a waiver or amendment result in a breach of these accounts receivable financing arrangements and require the evergy companies to repay any outstanding loans further in 2020 the evergy companies have experienced lower retail electric sales as a result of decreases in weathernormalized commercial and industrial demand to the extent that the evergy companies continue to experience lower electric sales they may not have sufficient eligible receivables to maximize their borrowing capacity under their receivables sales facilities or could be required to repay additional portions of their borrowings under the facilities in addition the covid19 pandemic led to disruption and volatility in the financial markets which in turn could impair the evergy companies ability to access the capital markets or increase their cost of capital 

the evergy companies are planning to make significant capital expenditures and they regularly conduct maintenance on their facilities the pandemic could disrupt the supply chains that provide services and equipment to the evergy companies as part of their capital expenditures or maintenance efforts if the evergy companies supply chains are disrupted the evergy companies may be unable to perform necessary maintenance which could result in increased costs as the evergy companies implement contingency plans to allow them to continue to operate supply chain interruptions may also increase the cost of maintenance and capital expenditures or result in the delay or cancellation of planned projects any of which could have a material adverse impact on the evergy companies results of operations 

the evergy companies also have a significant amount of nols tax credits and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on their balance sheets these tax benefits have various expiration dates and other limitations on the extent to which the benefits can be realized the evergy companies regularly assess their future ability to utilize tax benefits to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary a significant reduction in the evergy companies taxable income due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could require the evergy companies to record a valuation allowance against a portion of those tax assets which in turn reduces earnings and the evergy companies may in general not be able to utilize these tax benefits 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has changed the way the evergy companies operate and has increased the use of technology to enable remoteworking arrangements which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities public reports have also indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due in part to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which employees and third parties interact with the evergy companies information technology infrastructure a successful attack against the evergy companies or cyberattacks to interconnected utilities municipalities others or widespread attacks to the utility industry could result in disruption to the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general reduce sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the us economy furthermore insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses 

any of these circumstances or other impacts of the pandemic could adversely affect customer demand or revenues impact the ability of the evergy companies suppliers vendors or contractors to perform or cause other unpredictable events which could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position liquidity and cash flows of the evergy companies

strategy 

evergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks in august 2020 evergy announced a fiveyear sustainability transformation plan or stp to optimize and enhance value creation for shareholders customers communities and employees significant elements of the plan include 

• targeting a reduction of approximately 330 million of operating and maintenance expense by 2024 from 2018 adjusted operating and maintenance expense nongaap see nongaap measures within this executive summary for a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

• targeting a reduction of approximately 145 million of fuel and purchased power expense between 2019 and 2024 and 

• targeting approximately 89 billion of expected base capital investments through 2024 of this amount evergy estimates approximately 29 billion to qualify for pisa in missouri and approximately 19 billion to be focused on fercjurisdictional improvements see liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures for further information regarding evergys projected capital expenditures through 2024 

the stp also enhances evergys efforts to mitigate future strategic risk through the responsible and accelerated reduction of co 2 emissions in 2020 evergy achieved a reduction of co 2 emissions of approximately 50 from 2005 levels and announced a goal to achieve an 80 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 the stp has the potential to reduce co 2 emissions by as much as 85 by 2030 compared to 2005 levels the stp includes steps that would expedite co 2 emission reductions by pursuing constructive legislative and regulatory recovery mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of coalfired generation and expansion of evergys wind and solar footprint while maintaining reliability the pace of co 2 emission reductions will ultimately be defined by continued collaboration with stakeholders as part of evergys triennial integrated resource plan furthermore the trajectory and timing for reaching this goal could be impacted by political legal and regulatory actions and applicable technology developments

agreements with elliott investment management lp and bluescape energy partners llc 

on february 25 2021 evergy entered into separate agreements with bluescape energy partners llc bluescape elliott investment management lp elliott and affiliates of elliott as part of the agreement with bluescape the bluescape agreement c john wilder executive chairman of bluescape and mary l landrieu former us senator for louisiana will join the evergy board effective as of march 1 2021 

in addition pursuant to a securities purchase agreement by and between evergy and an affiliate of bluescape dated as of february 25 2021 the bluescape investment agreement bluescape has agreed to purchase 2269447 shares of evergy’s common stock for approximately 1132 million and will receive a warrant to purchase up to 3950000 additional shares of evergy’s common stock in each case subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions 

including the expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 the warrant will have a term of three years and an exercise price equal to 6470 

each of bluescape and elliott also agreed to customary standstill voting and other provisions in connection with the foregoing the foregoing summaries of the bluescape agreement and the bluescape investment agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the bluescape agreement and the bluescape investment agreement respectively a copy of which is attached as exhibit 101 and exhibit 102 respectively to evergy’s current report on form 8k filed on february 26 2021 and are incorporated herein by reference 

impact of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the way that the evergy companies conduct their operations including the implementation of social distancing and other preventative protocols and the direction of employees to work remotely when possible further the spread of covid19 has resulted in efforts to contain the virus such as quarantines restrictions on travel closures and the reduced operations of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions the pandemic along with the efforts to contain the virus has caused and could continue to cause an economic slowdown or recession result in significant disruptions or reductions in various public commercial or industrial activities and cause employee absences in the states of missouri and kansas as well as certain counties and municipalities within the evergy companies service territory stayathome orders were in effect for parts of 2020 and could be implemented again in the future 

governmental mandates that restrict the operation of businesses governmental agencies and other institutions continue to remain in effect and a substantial portion of the evergy companies service territory is also required to utilize preventative measures such as the wearing of face coverings while in public areas the announcement in late 2020 of multiple covid19 vaccines with high expected effectiveness rates could serve to mitigate both the severity and ongoing duration of the covid19 outbreak however both the magnitude and timing of the impact of the covid19 vaccines is not yet known and could be subject to multiple factors including the available supply of vaccine the vaccine adoption rate by the general public and the achievement of the vaccines expected effectiveness rates management cannot foresee whether the outbreak of covid19 will be effectively contained nor can it predict the severity and ongoing duration of its impact 

during 2020 evergy experienced an overall reduction in demand and shift of usage away from customers with relatively higher load requirements such as industrial and commercial customers towards customers with relatively lower load requirements such as residential customers in 2020 approximately 39 of evergys total revenues came from residential customers and approximately 45 came from commercial and industrial customers compared with approximately 37 from residential customers and 47 from commercial and industrial customers in 2019 the kcc and mpsc have established different prices for the evergy companies residential commercial and industrial customers and a similar change in demand across each customer class will have a different impact on earnings as a result the impacts to evergys earnings from a reduction in demand from industrial and commercial customers have been partially offset by an increase in demand from residential customers 

the evergy companies have also temporarily implemented policies and in the future may implement additional policies that are intended to ease the financial burden of the pandemic on customers these policies such as temporarily extending payment options and offering incentives for customer payments on overdue balances as well as the elimination of late payment fees and disconnections for nonpayment could lead to lower levels of operating cash flows compared to historical levels for the evergy companies in addition these policies along with lower electric sales as a result of the overall reduction in demand discussed above could also lead to the additional repayment of portions of the evergy companies borrowings under receivable sale facilities 

finally the evergy companies have incurred and will continue to incur expenses related to monitoring the covid19 pandemic and modifying operations in response to the pandemic that are recorded in operating and maintenance expense 

in may 2020 evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west filed joint requests for aaos with the kcc and mpsc as applicable that would allow for the extraordinary costs and lost revenues incurred by the 

companies net of any covid19related savings as a result of the covid19 pandemic to be considered for future recovery from customers as part of their next rate cases the kcc approved the aao request in july 2020 

in october 2020 evergy metro and evergy missouri west entered into a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement with the mpsc staff and other intervenors that would allow evergy metro and evergy missouri west to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred associated with the covid19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases the mpsc approved the aao request in january 2021 

evergys management is actively monitoring the evolving impact of covid19 on its results of operations and developments affecting its workforce and suppliers and will take additional actions as it believes are warranted the situation is continuously evolving and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known accordingly the extent to which covid19 and the factors noted above may impact the results of operations financial position cash flows and liquidity of the evergy companies will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information concerning the severity and ongoing duration of the covid19 outbreak and the actions taken to contain it or to seek recovery of its impact among others

february 2021 winter weather event 

in february 2021 much of the central and southern united states including the service territories of the evergy companies experienced a significant winter weather event that resulted in extremely cold temperatures over a multiday period this winter weather event resulted in an increase in the demand for natural gas used by the evergy companies for generating electricity and also contributed to the limited availability of other generation resources including coal and renewables within the spp integrated marketplace the evergy companies are members of the spp and as a result principally sell and purchase power through the spp’s integrated marketplace for the evergy companies’ retail electric customers these circumstances resulted in higher than normal market prices for both natural gas and power for the duration of the winter weather event evergy estimates that as part of the winter weather event it experienced an increase in natural gas and purchased power costs net of wholesale revenues of approximately 300 million this 300 million increase in net fuel and purchased power costs was primarily driven by a 260 million increase in costs at evergy missouri west and a 100 million increase at evergy kansas central partially offset by a 60 million net increase in wholesale revenues at evergy metro these amounts represent preliminary estimates and are still under development further the final amount of purchased power costs incurred by the evergy companies is subject to final settlement pricing by the spp integrated marketplace which is currently expected to take an additional 30 to 45 days though the ultimate timing is uncertain 

the evergy companies have fuel recovery mechanisms in their kansas and missouri jurisdictions as applicable that allow them to defer substantially all of any increased fuel and purchased power costs net of wholesale revenues to a regulatory asset for future recovery from customers further in february 2021 the kcc issued an emergency order that would allow the evergy companies as applicable to defer to a regulatory asset any extraordinary costs incurred to continue providing electric service during the winter weather event for consideration in future rate proceedings while the evergy companies expect to recover substantially all of any increased fuel and purchased power costs related to the winter weather event from customers it is possible that the timing of the cost recovery could be delayed or spread over a longer than typical recovery timeframe by the kcc or the mpsc given the extraordinary nature of the winter weather event 

the evergy companies also engage in limited nonregulated energy marketing activities in various regional power markets that have historically not had a significant impact on the evergy companies’ results of operations as a result of the elevated market prices experienced in regional power markets in february 2021 across the central and southern united states driven by the winter weather event discussed above the evergy companies currently expect that their energy marketing margins will be higher in 2021 compared with historical results 

the full financial statement impact of the winter weather event is unknown and cannot be estimated at this time due in part to the timing of market settlement data the evergy companies believe they have sufficient liquidity to pay any outstanding balances or fulfill collateral posting requirements related to purchases made during the winter storm event and to operate their retail electric businesses through their cash on hand and master credit facility with available borrowing capacity as of february 25 2021 of approximately 2 billion

earnings overview 

the following table summarizes evergys net income and diluted earnings per share eps 



net income attributable to evergy inc decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower retail sales driven by unfavorable weather and a decrease in weathernormalized commercial and industrial demand primarily due to temporary business closures and hours of operation and capacity limitations as a result of covid19 that were partially offset by an increase in weathernormalized residential demand and higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in 2020 

diluted eps decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the decrease in net income attributable to evergy discussed above partially offset by a lower number of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in 2020 which increased eps by 014 for 2020

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on evergys results of operations and financial position management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of evergys results of operations and financial position management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the evergy board 

pensions 

evergy incurs significant costs in providing noncontributory defined pension benefits the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 

pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age life expectancies compensation levels and employment periods earnings on plan assets the level of contributions made to the plan and plan amendments in addition pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 

the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weightedaverage of longterm returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan the assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation these assumptions updated annually at the measurement date are based on managements best estimates and judgment however material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 

the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 05 increase or a 05 decrease in key actuarial assumptions for evergys qualified pension plans each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only 



pension expense for evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the kcc and mpsc the orders allow the difference between pension costs under gaap and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds as appropriate 

in 2020 evergys pension expense was 1295 million under gaap and 1591 million for ratemaking the impact on 2021 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on gaap pension costs under the evergy companies rate agreements any increase or decrease in gaap pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions 

market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan it is difficult to predict future pension costs changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions 

revenue recognition 

evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by evergy unbilled revenues are recorded for kwh usage in the period following the customers billing cycle to the end of the month this estimate is based on net system kwh usage less actual billed kwhs evergys estimated unbilled kwhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates evergys unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand weather line losses and 

changes in the composition of customer classes see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the balance of unbilled receivables for evergy as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers 

management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc kcc or ferc in evergys rate case filings decisions in other regulatory proceedings including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to evergy and changes in laws and regulations if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations evergys continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules in the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of evergys operations the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided additionally these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairments of assets and goodwill 

longlived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under gaap 

accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill to identify potential impairment in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value evergys consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis the annual impairment test for the 23366 million of goodwill from the great plains energy and evergy kansas central merger was conducted as of may 1 2020 the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill as a result there was no impairment of goodwill 

the determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies the results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit which involves a significant amount of management judgment 

the discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the kcc and mpsc and aftertax cost of debt estimated future cash flows are based on evergys internal business plan which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future such as the outcome of future rate filings future approved rates of return on equity anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair 

value of the evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 

the market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by managements selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry changes in results of peer companies selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the evergy reporting unit 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the assetliability approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses capital losses and tax credit carryforwards evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in evergys consolidated financial statements or tax returns actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities this process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations 

evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets concurrent with the recognition of the liability the estimated cost of the aro incurred at the time the related longlived assets were either acquired placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets the recording of aros for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability 

evergy initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 94 indirect share retire wind generating facilities dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills among other items aro refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity in determining evergys aros assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on evergys aros reflected on its consolidated balance sheets 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 evergy had recorded aros of 9419 million and 6741 million respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding evergys aros 

evergy results of operations   

evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation fuel costs weather customer behavior and demand the economy and competitive forces 

substantially all of evergys revenues are subject to state or federal regulation this regulation has a significant impact on the price the evergy companies charge for electric service evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending both operating and capital within the frameworks established by its regulators 

wholesale revenues are impacted by among other factors demand cost and availability of fuel and purchased power price volatility available generation capacity transmission availability and weather 

the evergy companies primarily use coal and uranium for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through renewable power purchase agreements or on the open market the prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of power purchases can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply demand weather and the broader economic environment evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west have fuel recovery mechanisms in their kansas and missouri jurisdictions as applicable that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding 

weather significantly affects the amount of electricity that evergys customers use as electricity sales are seasonal as summer peaking utilities the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the evergy companies hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand especially among residential and commercial customers and to a lesser extent industrial customers mild weather reduces customer demand 

energy efficiency investments by customers and the evergy companies also can affect the demand for electric service through the missouri energy efficiency investment act meeia evergy metro and evergy missouri west offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their missouri retail customers and recover program costs throughput disincentive and as applicable certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism 

the evergy companies taxes other than income taxes of which property taxes are a significant component can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including changes in taxable values and property tax rates evergy kansas central and evergy metros kansas jurisdiction have property tax surcharges that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding

evergy utility gross margin and mwh sales 

utility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with gaap utility gross margin as used by the evergy companies is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the spp for network transmission costs expenses for fuel and purchased power costs offset by wholesale sales margin are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms as a result changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income in addition spp network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by spp members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the spp rto as with fuel and purchased power costs changes in spp network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which evergy reflects spp revenues and expenses 

management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the evergy companies operations across periods because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the evergy board utility gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for income from operations which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with gaap the evergy companies definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies

liquidity and capital resources   

evergy relies primarily upon cash from operations shortterm borrowings debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements evergys capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures payment of contractual obligations and other commitments and the payment of dividends to shareholders 

capital sources 

cash flows from operations 

evergys cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity these cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions future regulatory proceedings the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages and storms 

shortterm borrowings 

as of december 31 2020 evergy had 22 billion of available borrowing capacity from its master credit facility the available borrowing capacity under the master credit facility consisted of 2493 million for evergy inc 9330 million for evergy kansas central 6000 million for evergy metro and 3830 million for evergy missouri west evergy kansas centrals evergy metros and evergy missouri wests borrowing capacity under the master 

credit facility also supports their issuance of commercial paper see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the master credit facility along with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its daytoday cash flow requirements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

in the ordinary course of business evergy faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include business legal operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis see part i item 1a risk factors and part ii item 7 mda for further discussion of risk factors 

the evergy companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply interest rates and security prices commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energyrelated products credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial 

impact related to changes in interest rates in addition evergys investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and to fund nonqualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk 

management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on evergys operating results during the ordinary course of business the evergy companies hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation though management believes its risk management practices are effective it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk evergy could experience losses which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position due to many factors including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets regulatorydriven market rule changes andor bankruptcy or nonperformance of customers or counterparties andor failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 

hedging strategies 

from time to time evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies derivative instruments such as futures forward contracts swaps or options derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 

commodity price risk 

the evergy companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to limited energy marketing activities these activities expose the evergy companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energyrelated products exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels evergys exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the costbased regulation of its regulated operations in kansas and missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through fuel recovery mechanisms while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results 

interest rate risk 

evergy manages interest rate risk and short and longterm liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt to a percentage of total debt diversifying maturity dates and from time to time entering into interest rate hedging transactions at december 31 2020 3 of evergys longterm debt was variable rate debt evergy also has shortterm borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt that are exposed to interest rate risk evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100basispoint change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 

evergy had 10387 million of variable rate debt including notes payable commercial paper and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december 31 2020 a 100basispoint change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately 62 million 

credit risk 

evergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure the credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by evergys large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates the evergy companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms such as letters of credit when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure 

investment risk 

evergy maintains trust funds as required by the nrc to fund its 94 share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain nonqualified retirement benefits as of december 31 2020 these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on evergys balance sheet the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors 

as nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for these securities as an offset to its regulatory liability for decommissioning wolf creek and as such fluctuations in the value of these securities do not impact earnings a significant decline in the value of pension or nonqualified retirement assets could require evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods in addition a decline in the fair value of these plan assets in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by evergy could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by evergy

competition 

missouri and kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model as a result the evergy companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a writeoff of certain regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory this competition primarily occurs within the spp integrated marketplace in which evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are participants this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time for maximum regional costeffectiveness 

the spp integrated marketplace is similar to other regional transmission organization rto or independent system operator iso markets currently operating in other regions of the united states

environmental matters 

there have been and management believes there will continue to be policy legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ghg impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency these efforts and climate change itself have the potential to adversely affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows see part i item 1a risk factors for additional information

transforming evergys generation fleet 

the evergy companies are committed to a longterm strategy to reduce carbon emissions in a costeffective and reliable manner and are targeting to achieve an 80 reduction of carbon emissions by 2050 from 2005 levels the trajectory and timing of reaching this goal could be impacted by political legal and regulatory actions and technological matters public attention is currently focused on reducing ghg emissions and closing coalfired generating units diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits in addition the evergy companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the evergy companies to include in rates and avoid stranding assets by prematurely closing facilities the evergy companies use an integrated resource plan which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and

 item 1a risk factors 

utility regulatory risks 

prices are established by regulators and may not be sufficient to result in a recovery of costs or provide for a return on investment 

the prices that the ferc kcc and mpsc authorize the utility subsidiaries of evergy to charge significantly influence the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in general utilities are allowed to recover in customer rates costs that were prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on invested capital there can be no assurance however that regulators will determine costs to have been prudently incurred further the amounts approved by the regulators may not be sufficient to allow for a recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments also amounts that were approved by regulators may be appealed modified limited or eliminated by subsequent regulatory or legislative actions a failure to recover costs or earn a reasonable return on invested capital could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of evergy and its utility subsidiaries 

the evergy companies are also exposed to costrecovery shortfalls due to the inherent regulatory lag in the ratesetting process this is because utility rates are generally based on historical information and except for certain situations where regulators allow for recovery of expenses through use of a formula that tracks costs are not subject to adjustment between rate cases in connection with the merger evergy kansas central and evergy metro agreed

to a fiveyear base rate moratorium in kansas beginning in december 2018 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition effective as of january 1 2019 evergy metro and evergy missouri west elected into plantin service accounting pisa which by law requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following evergy metros and evergy missouri wests last general rate case and limits the extent to which prices can increase thereafter these and other factors may result in underrecovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment or both 

failure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings reduced access to capital markets increased financing costs lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures in response to competitive economic political legislative public perception and regulatory pressures evergys utility subsidiaries may be subject to rate moratoriums rate refunds limits on rate increases lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions including phasein plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period for the benefit of customers any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of the evergy companies 

legislative and regulatory requirements may increase costs and result in compliance penalties 

ferc the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and spp have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements such as vegetation management standards facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards in addition evergy is also subject to health safety and other requirements enacted by the occupational safety and health administration the department of transportation the department of labor and other federal and state agencies as discussed more fully under operational risks the nrc extensively regulates nuclear power plants including wolf creek the costs of complying with existing new or modified regulations standards and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies furthermore regulatory changes could result in operational changes that increase costs or adversely impact the evergy companies prospects in addition failure to meet quality of service reliability cybersecurity critical infrastructure protection operational or other standards and requirements could expose the evergy companies to penalties additional compliance costs or adverse rate consequences any of which could have a material adverse impact on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

environmental risks 

costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including those relating to ghg emissions are significant and may adversely impact operations and financial results 

the evergy companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal state and local environmental laws regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality waste management and hazardous substance disposal protected natural resources such as wetlands endangered species and other protected wildlife and health and safety for example evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  and other ghgs federal legislation regulates the emission of ghgs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce ghg emissions the environmental protection agency epa the kansas department of health and environment kdhe and the missouri department of natural resources mdnr regulate emissions under the clean air act amendments of 1990 caa water under the clean water act cwa and waste management under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra among other laws and regulations see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

compliance with these laws regulations and requirements requires significant capital and operating resources and the failure to comply could result in substantial fines injunctive relief and other sanctions in addition there is a risk of lawsuits alleging violations of environmental laws regulations or requirements claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other relief 

table of contents 

environmental permits are subject to periodic renewal which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits new facilities or modifications of existing facilities may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits delays in the environmental permitting process public opposition and challenges denials of permit applications limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects and thus materially adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in addition compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements could alter the way assets are managed which in turn could result in retiring assets earlier than expected recording asset retirement obligations aros or having a regulator disallow recovery of costs that had been prudently incurred in connection with those assets 

costs of compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements or fines penalties or negative lawsuit outcomes if not recovered in rates from customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

financial risks 

financial market disruptions or declines in the evergy companies credit ratings may increase financing costs and limit access to the credit markets which may adversely affect liquidity and financial results 

the evergy companies rely on funds from operations and access to the capital and credit markets to fund capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity disruption in capital or credit markets increases in interest rates deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which the evergy companies rely credit rating downgrades a decrease in the market price of evergys common stock or a decrease or disappearance in the demand for debt securities issued by the evergy companies or subsidiaries could have material adverse effects on the evergy companies these effects could include among others reduced access to capital and increased cost of borrowed funds and collateral requirements dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other postretirement benefit plan funding requirements reduced ability to pay dividends rate case disallowance of costs of capital reductions in or delays of capital expenditures and limitations in the ability of evergy to provide credit support for its subsidiaries further evergy kansas central and evergy metro have outstanding taxexempt bonds that may be put back to the respective issuer at the option of the holders which could adversely impact liquidity in addition market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on evergys lenders suppliers and other counterparties or customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations 

evergy is a holding company and relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations 

evergy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its direct subsidiaries particularly evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west evergys subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide evergy with funds the ability of evergys subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions and accordingly evergys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the earnings and cash flows capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries as well as regulatory factors financial covenants general business conditions and other matters 

in addition the evergy companies are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends under the federal power act evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings in connection with approval of the merger in missouri each of evergy metro and evergy missouri west agreed to not pay dividends to evergy if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services in connection with approval of the merger in kansas each of evergy kansas central and evergy metro agreed to not pay dividends to evergy if i the payment would result in an increase in the utilitys debt level excluding shortterm debt and debt due within one year above 60 percent of its total capitalization absent approval from the kcc or ii if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services as described elsewhere in this form 10k the evergy companies are also required to maintain a 

table of contents 

consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 065 to 100 which could restrict the amount of dividends the evergy companies are permitted to pay evergy cannot guarantee dividends will be paid in the future or that if paid dividends will satisfy announced targets or investor expectations or be paid with the same frequency as in the past 

in addition from time to time evergy may guarantee debt obligations of its subsidiaries under the financing agreements to which evergy is a party a guarantee of debt may be considered indebtedness for purposes of complying with financial covenants that dictate the extent to which evergy can borrow money and any guarantee payments could adversely affect evergys liquidity and ability to service its own debt obligations 

increasing costs associated with defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans health care plans and other employee benefits could adversely affect evergys financial position and liquidity 

evergy maintains defined benefit retirement and other postretirement employee benefit plans for certain current and former employees the costs of these plans depend on a number of factors including the rates of return on plan assets the level and nature of the provided benefits discount rates the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels changes in benefit design changes in laws or regulations and the amount of any required or voluntary contributions to the plans the evergy companies have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans also if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels these plans experience adverse market returns on investments or interest rates fall required or voluntary contributions to the plans could be material in addition changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs returns on investments interest rates and other actuarial assumptions including projected retirements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased in recent years and may continue to rise in the future future legislative changes related to health care could also cause significant changes to benefit programs and costs the increasing costs associated with health care plans could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the use of derivative contracts could result in financial losses and impair liquidity 

the evergy companies use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage commodity and financial risks losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts if a counterparty fails to perform or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or the use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 

tax legislation and an inability to utilize tax credits could adversely impact financial results and liquidity 

tax laws and regulations can adversely affect among other things financial results liquidity credit ratings and the valuation of assets such as deferred income tax assets over the last several years income tax obligations have been reduced due to the use of bonus depreciation provisions that allow for an acceleration of deductions for tax purposes and irs guidance on tax deductions for repairs the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utilities on new capital investments the evergy companies regularly assess their ability to utilize tax benefits including those in the form of net operating loss tax credit and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on its balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary a reduction in or disallowance of these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the evergy companies additionally changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes such as those resulting from the tcja as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the evergy companies 

in addition the evergy companies construct and operate renewable energy facilities that generate tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations the amount of tax credits is dependent on several factors including the amount of electricity produced and the applicable tax credit rate a variety of operating and economic parameters including transmission constraints adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment could 

table of contents 

significantly reduce these tax credits which could have an adverse impact on the financial results of the evergy companies 

the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized 

the evergy companies have incurred and expect to incur additional significant costs associated with combining the operations of great plains energy and evergy kansas central additional unanticipated costs may also be incurred in the integration of the businesses of great plains energy and evergy kansas central the evergy companies expect the merger to produce various benefits including among other things operating efficiencies and cost savings however achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties including 

 no assurance can be given that these benefits will be achieved or achieved in a timely manner integration costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of the evergy companies and a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in addition the evergy companies may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of the companies including inconsistencies in standards systems and controls and managements focus and resources may be diverted from ordinary business activities and opportunities in order to focus on integration efforts any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies 

the price of evergy common stock may experience volatility 

the price of evergy common stock may be volatile some of the factors that could affect the price of evergy common stock are evergys earnings estimates or statements by the investment community the ability of the evergy companies to implement their strategic plan or to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from the merger the ability of evergy to deploy capital actions by regulators and speculation in the press or investment community about the evergy companies strategy earnings per share or growth prospects financial condition or results of operations individuals or entities such as activist shareholders and special interest groups may also seek to influence the evergy companies strategic plan or take other actions that could disrupt the evergy companies business financial results or operations and could adversely impact evergys stock price general market conditions and us economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of the evergy may also affect evergys stock price for these reasons shareholders should not rely on historical trends in the price of great plains energy or evergy kansas central common stock to predict the price of evergys common stock or its financial results 

evergy has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results  

as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap evergy recorded a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet in connection with completion of the merger evergy assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment if goodwill is deemed to be impaired evergy may be required to incur noncash charges that could materially adversely affect its results of operations 

customer and weatherrelated risks 

evergys results of operations financial position and cash flows can be materially affected by changes in electricity consumption 

change in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the consumption of energy by customers federal and state programs exist to influence the way customers use energy and regulators have mandates to promote energy efficiency conservation programs and customers level of participation in the programs could impact the financial results of the evergy companies in adverse ways 

table of contents 

technological advances energy efficiency and other energy conservation measures have reduced and will continue to reduce customer electricity consumption the evergy companies generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost selfgeneration and distributed generation technologies including microturbines wind turbines fuel cells and solar cells as well as those related to the storage of energy produced by these systems have become economically competitive with the manner and price at which the evergy companies sell electricity there is also a perception that generating or storing electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels increased adoption of these technologies could reduce electricity demand and the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered resulting in under recovery of the fixed costs of the evergy companies increased selfgeneration and the related use of net energy metering which allows selfgenerating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power could put upward price pressure on remaining customers if the evergy companies are unable to adjust to reduced electricity demand and increased selfgeneration and net energy metering their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions downturns or sluggishness in the economy or other factors may also adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

weather is a major driver of the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the evergy companies are subject to risks associated with climate change 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for and price of electricity the evergy companies are significantly impacted by seasonality and due to energy demand created by air conditioning load highest revenues are typically recorded in the third quarter unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales in addition severe weather and events including tornados snow fire rain flooding and ice storms can be destructive and cause outages and property damage that can result in increased expenses lower revenues and additional capital restoration costs storm reserves established by the evergy companies may be insufficient and rates may not be adjusted in a timely manner or at all to recover these costs additionally because many of the evergy companies generating stations utilize water for cooling low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations result in limited power production and require modifications to plant operations high water conditions can also impair planned deliveries of fuel to generating stations climate change may produce more frequent or severe weather events such as storms droughts or floods and could also impact the economic health of evergys service territories an increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events or a deterioration in the economic health of evergys service territories could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

in addition policy legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce ghg emissions impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency could result in reduced sales and require significant costs to respond to such efforts these efforts could also result in the early retirement of generation facilities which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow recovery of investments that were prudent when originally made the evergy companies are targeting to achieve an 80 reduction of carbon emissions by 2050 from 2005 levels the trajectory and timing of the goal could be impacted by various factors including policy legal or regulatory actions a lack of technological advancements or other reasons any of the foregoing could adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the market prices of evergys common stock 

operational risks 

operational risks may adversely affect the evergy companies 

the operation of electric generation transmission distribution and information systems involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment aging infrastructure operator error or contractor or subcontractor failure problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental safety or other regulatory requirements fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions labor disputes difficulties with the implementation or operation of 

table of contents 

information systems transmission scheduling constraints and catastrophic events such as fires floods droughts explosions terrorism severe weather pandemics or other similar occurrences many of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution resources are aged which increases the risk of unplanned outages reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense any equipment or system outage or constraint can among other things reduce sales increase costs and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics customer expectations and regulatory reliability and security requirements 

the evergy companies have general liability and property insurance to cover a portion of their facilities but such policies do not cover transmission or distribution systems are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage 

these and other operating events may reduce revenues or increase costs or both and may materially affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

physical and cybersecurity breaches criminal activity terrorist attacks and other disruptions to facilities or information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations expose the evergy companies or their customers or employees to a risk of loss expose the evergy companies to legal or regulatory liability and cause reputational and other harm 

the evergy companies rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity supply chain functions and the invoicing and collection of payments from customers the evergy companies also use information technology networks and systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements these networks and systems are in some cases owned or managed by thirdparty service providers in the ordinary course of business the evergy companies collect store and transmit sensitive data including operating information proprietary business information and personal information belonging to customers and employees 

the evergy companies information technology networks and infrastructure as well as the networks and infrastructure belonging to thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other unauthorized third parties error or malfeasance by one or more employees or service providers software or hardware upgrades additions or replacements malicious software code telecommunication failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could among other things impact the reliability or safety of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems result in the erasure of data or render the evergy companies equipment or the equipment of thirdparty service providers unusable impact the evergy companies ability to conduct business in the ordinary course reduce sales expose the evergy companies and their customers employees and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of information and result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties damage the evergy companies reputation or otherwise harm their business the evergy companies can provide no assurance that they will be able to identify and remediate all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remediated 

the evergy companies are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of their security customer and business information for example nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and new requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at nuclear power plants compliance with nerc and nrc rules and standards and rules and standards promulgated by other regulatory agencies from time to time or future legislation will increase the evergy companies compliance costs and their exposure to the potential risk of violations of these rules standards or future legislation which includes potential financial penalties furthermore the noncompliance of other utilities with applicable regulations or the 

table of contents 

occurrence of a serious security event at other utilities could result in increased regulation or oversight both of which could increase the evergy companies costs and impact their financial results 

additionally the evergy companies cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or malicious attack may have on the energy industry in general the electric utility industry both within the united states and internationally has experienced physical and cybersecurity attacks on energy infrastructure such as power plants substations and related assets in the past and there will likely be more attacks in the future the evergy companies facilities and systems could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks the effects of such attacks could include disruption to the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general reduced sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the us economy any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the evergy companies operations or financial results 

the cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved 

the evergy companies business is capital intensive and includes significant construction projects the risks of any capital project include actual costs may exceed estimated costs regulators may disallow limit or delay the recovery of all or part of the cost of or a return on a capital project risks associated with the capital and credit markets to fund projects delays in receiving or failure to receive necessary permits approvals and other regulatory authorizations unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts inadequate availability or increased cost of labor or materials including commodities such as steel copper and aluminum that may be subject to uncertain or increased tariffs inclement weather new or changed laws regulations and requirements including environmental and health and safety laws regulations and requirements and other events beyond the evergy companies control may occur that may materially affect the schedule cost and performance of these projects 

these and other risks could cause the evergy companies to defer or limit capital expenditures materially increase the costs of capital projects delay the inservice dates of projects adversely affect the performance of the projects and require the purchase of electricity on the wholesale market at potentially more expensive prices until the projects are completed these risks may significantly affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies are exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit which could adversely impact the evergy companies business and financial results 

evergy indirectly owns 94 of wolf creek with evergy kansas south and evergy metro each owning 47 of the nuclear plant the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities including wolf creek in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines shut down the facilities or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved additionally the noncompliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry such events could increase wolf creeks costs and impact the financial results of the evergy companies or result in a shutdown of wolf creek 

an extended outage of wolf creek whether resulting from nrc action an incident at the plant or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in the event replacement power and other costs are not recovered through rates or insurance if a longterm outage occurred the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base wolf creek was constructed prior to 1986 and the age of wolf creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs 

on an annual basis evergy kansas south and evergy metro are required to contribute money to taxqualified trusts that were established to pay for decommissioning costs at the end of the units life the amount of contributions varies depending on estimates of decommissioning expenses and projected return on trust assets if the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated evergy 

table of contents 

kansas south and evergy metro could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates 

the evergy companies are also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit including but not limited to i potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit ii the storage handling disposal and potential release by accident through thirdparty actions or otherwise of radioactive materials and iii uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units evergy kansas south and evergy metro are also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments subject to a cap per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage 

in addition wolf creek is reliant on a sole supplier for fuel and related services the supplier has in the past been the subject of chapter 11 reorganization proceedings and an extended outage of wolf creek could occur if the supplier is not able to perform under its contracts with wolf creek switching to another supplier could take an extended amount of time and would require nrc approval an extended outage at wolf creek could affect the amount of wolf creek investment included in customer rates and could have a material impact on the evergy companies financial results 

the structure of the regional power market in which the evergy companies operate could have an adverse effect on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west are members of the spp regional transmission organization and each has transferred operational authority but not ownership of their transmission facilities to the spp the spps integrated marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time for maximum costeffectiveness in the event that evergy kansas centrals evergy metros or evergy missouri wests generating units are not among the lowest cost generating units operating within the market each could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales 

a market for transmission congestion rights tcr is also included as part of the integrated marketplace tcrs are financial instruments used to hedge transmission congestion charges evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west acquire tcrs for the purpose of hedging against transmission congestion charges there is a risk that the entities could incorrectly model the amount of tcrs needed or that the tcrs acquired could be ineffective in hedging against transmission congestion charges either of which could lead to increased purchased power costs 

the rules governing the various regional power markets including the spp may change from time to time and such changes could impact the costs and revenues of the evergy companies 

litigation risks 

the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their respective businesses the outcome of these matters cannot be determined nor in many cases can the liability that could potentially result from each case be reasonably estimated the liability that the evergy companies may incur with respect to any of these cases may be in excess of amounts currently accrued and insured against with respect to such matters and could adversely impact the financial results for the evergy companies

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on evergys results of operations and financial position management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of evergys results of operations and financial position management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the evergy board 

pensions 

evergy incurs significant costs in providing noncontributory defined pension benefits the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 

pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age life expectancies compensation levels and employment periods earnings on plan assets the level of contributions made to the plan and plan amendments in addition pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 

the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weightedaverage of longterm returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan the assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation these assumptions updated annually at the measurement date are based on managements best estimates and judgment however material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 

the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 05 increase or a 05 decrease in key actuarial assumptions for evergys qualified pension plans each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only 



pension expense for evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the kcc and mpsc the orders allow the difference between pension costs under gaap and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds as appropriate 

in 2019  evergys pension expense was 1313 million under gaap and 1687 million for ratemaking the impact on 2020 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on gaap pension costs under the evergy companies rate agreements any increase or decrease in gaap pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or

market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan it is difficult to predict future pension costs changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions 

revenue recognition 

evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by evergy unbilled revenues are recorded for kwh usage in the period following the customers billing cycle to the end of the month this estimate is based on net system kwh usage less actual billed kwhs evergys estimated unbilled kwhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates evergys unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand weather line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes see note 4 for the balance of unbilled receivables for evergy as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers 

management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc kcc or ferc in evergys rate case filings decisions in other regulatory proceedings including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to evergy and changes in laws and regulations if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations evergys continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules in the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of evergys operations the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided additionally these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairments of assets and goodwill 

longlived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under gaap 

accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill to identify potential impairment in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value evergys consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis the annual impairment test for the 23366 million of goodwill from the great plains energy and evergy kansas central merger was conducted on may 1 2019 the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill as a result there was no impairment of goodwill 

the determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies the results of the two techniques 

table of contents 

were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit which involves a significant amount of management judgment 

the discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the kcc and mpsc and aftertax cost of debt estimated future cash flows are based on evergys internal business plan which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future such as the outcome of future rate filings future approved rates of return on equity anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 

the market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by managements selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry changes in results of peer companies selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the evergy reporting unit 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the assetliability approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses capital losses and tax credit carryforwards evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in evergys consolidated financial statements or tax returns actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities this process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations 

evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets concurrent with the recognition of the liability the estimated cost of the aro incurred at the time the related longlived assets were either acquired placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets the recording of aros for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability 

evergy initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 94 indirect share retire wind generating facilities dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills among other items aro refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity in determining evergys aros assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on evergys aros reflected on its consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  evergy had recorded aros of 6741 million and 6871 million  respectively see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding evergys aros 

evergy results of operations   

evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation fuel costs weather customer behavior and demand the economy and competitive forces 

substantially all of evergys revenues are subject to state or federal regulation this regulation has a significant impact on the price the evergy companies charge for electric service evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending both operating and capital within the frameworks established by its regulators 

wholesale revenues are impacted by among other factors demand cost and availability of fuel and purchased power price volatility available generation capacity transmission availability and weather 

the evergy companies primarily use coal and uranium for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through purchase power agreements or on the open market the prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of purchased power can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply demand weather and the broader economic environment evergy kansas central evergy metro and evergy missouri west have fuel recovery mechanisms in their kansas and missouri jurisdictions as applicable that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding 

weather significantly affects the amount of electricity that evergys customers use as electricity sales are seasonal as summer peaking utilities the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the evergy companies hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand especially among residential and commercial customers and to a lesser extent industrial customers mild weather reduces customer demand 

energy efficiency investments by customers and the evergy companies also can affect the demand for electric service through the missouri energy efficiency investment act meeia evergy metro and evergy missouri west offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their missouri retail customers and recover program costs throughput disincentive and as applicable certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism 

the evergy companies taxes other than income taxes of which property taxes are a significant component can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including changes in taxable values and property tax rates evergy kansas central and evergy metros kansas jurisdiction have property tax surcharges that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding

evergy utility gross margin and mwh sales 

utility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with gaap utility gross margin as used by the evergy companies is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the spp for network transmission costs expenses for fuel and purchased power costs offset by wholesale sales margin are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms as a result changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income in addition spp network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by spp members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the spp rto as with fuel and purchased power costs changes in spp network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which evergy reflects spp revenues and expenses 

management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the evergy companies operations across periods compared with operating revenues because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the evergy board the evergy companies definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies

the evergy companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply interest rates and equity prices commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energyrelated products credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates in addition evergys investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and to fund nonqualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk 

management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on evergys operating results during the ordinary course of business the evergy companies hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation though management believes its risk management practices are effective it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk evergy could experience losses which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position due to many factors including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets regulatorydriven market rule changes andor bankruptcy or nonperformance of customers or counterparties andor failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 

hedging strategies 

from time to time evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies derivative instruments such as futures forward contracts swaps or options derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 

commodity price risk 

the evergy companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity and are exposed to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energyrelated products exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels evergys exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the costbased regulation of its regulated operations in kansas and missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through costrecovery mechanisms primarily through fuel recovery mechanisms while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results

interest rate risk 

evergy manages interest rate risk and short and longterm liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt to a percentage of total debt diversifying maturity dates and from time to time entering into interest rate hedging transactions at december 31 2019  3 of evergys longterm debt was variable rate debt evergy also has shortterm borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt that are exposed to interest rate risk evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100basispoint change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 

evergy had 11137 million of variable rate debt including notes payable commercial paper and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december 31 2019  a 100basispoint change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately 99 million 

credit risk 

evergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure the credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by evergys large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates the evergy companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms such as letters of credit when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure 

investment risk 

evergy maintains trust funds as required by the nrc to fund its 94 share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain nonqualified retirement benefits as of december 31 2019  these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on evergys balance sheet the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors 

as nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for these securities as an offset to its regulatory asset for decommissioning wolf creek and as such fluctuations in the value of these securities do not impact earnings a significant decline in the value of pension or nonqualified retirement assets could require evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods in addition a decline in the fair value of these plan assets in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by evergy could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by evergy

the table below summarizes the percentage of evergys retail electricity sales by customer class 



merger of great plains energy and westar energy 

evergy was incorporated in 2017 as monarch energy holding inc monarch energy a whollyowned subsidiary of great plains energy incorporated great plains energy prior to the closing of the merger transactions monarch energy changed its name to evergy and did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the amended and restated agreement and plan of merger dated as of july 9 2017 by and among great plains energy westar energy monarch energy and king energy inc king energy a whollyowned subsidiary of monarch energy amended merger agreement 

on june 4 2018 evergy completed the mergers contemplated by the amended merger agreement as a result of the mergers great plains energy merged into evergy with evergy surviving the merger and king energy merged into westar energy with westar energy surviving the merger following the completion of these mergers westar energy and the direct subsidiaries of great plains energy including kcpl and gmo became whollyowned subsidiaries of evergy 

the merger was structured as a merger of equals in a taxfree exchange of shares that involved no premium paid or received with respect to either great plains energy or westar energy as a result of the closing of the merger transaction each outstanding share of great plains energy common stock was converted into 05981 shares of evergy common stock and each outstanding share of westar energy common stock was converted into 1 share of evergy common stock

see item 7 mda critical accounting policies section and note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters 

competition 

missouri and kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model as a result the evergy companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a write off of certain regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory this competition primarily occurs within the spp integrated marketplace in which westar energy kcpl and gmo are participants this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating constraints of a unit at any given time for maximum regional costeffectiveness 

the spp integrated marketplace is similar to other regional transmission organization rto or independent system operator iso markets currently operating in other regions of the united states 

power supply 

evergy has approximately 14500  mws of owned generating capacity and renewable purchased power agreements evergys owned generation and purchased power from others as a percentage of total mwhs generated and purchased was approximately 71 and 29  respectively for 2018 evergy purchases power to meet its customers needs to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards management believes evergy will be able to meet its future purchased power demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the spp region and existing power purchase agreements however price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand 

  

evergys total capacity by fuel type including both owned generating capacity and purchased power agreements is detailed in the table below 



a mws are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility includes owned generating capacity of 579 mws and longterm power purchase agreements of approximately 2863 mws of wind generation that expire in 2028 through 2048 

b includes a longterm power purchase agreement for approximately 66 mws of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023 

evergys projected peak summer demand for 2019  is approximately 10350  mws evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the foreseeable future with its existing generation assets and power and capacity purchases 

westar energy kcpl and gmo are members of the spp the spp is a fercapproved rto with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region as spp members westar energy kcpl and gmo are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 12 this net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership capacity agreements power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs the reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the regions electric supply 

fuel 

the fuel sources for evergys owned generation and purchased power agreements are coal wind and other renewable sources uranium and natural gas and oil the actual 2018  fuel mix and fuel cost in cents per net kilowatt hour kwh delivered are outlined in the following table and include fullyear 2018 amounts for westar energy kcpl and gmo 



coal 

during 2019  evergys generating units including jointlyowned units are projected to burn approximately 18 million tons of coal westar energy kcpl and gmo have entered into coalpurchase contracts with various suppliers in wyomings powder river basin prb the nations principal supply region of lowsulfur coal and with local suppliers the coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 80 of the projected coal requirements for 2019  and approximately 55 for 2020  the 

  

remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through entering into additional contracts or spot market purchases 

westar energy kcpl and gmo have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the prb and local suppliers to their generating units the transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2019  and 2020 the contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs 

nuclear fuel 

westar energy and kcpl each owns 47 of wolf creek which is evergys only nuclear generating unit wolf creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor this process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies the owners of wolf creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium uranium enrichment and conversion services needed to operate wolf creek through march 2027 the owners also have under contract all of the uranium fabrication required to operate wolf creek through september 2025 

natural gas 

natural gas accounted for approximately 8 of the total mmbtu of fuel consumed and approximately 14 of total fuel expense in 2018  from time to time evergy may enter into contracts including the use of derivatives in an effort to manage the cost of natural gas for additional information about our exposure to commodity price risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

westar energy maintains natural gas transportation arrangements with kansas gas service and southern star central gas pipeline the kansas gas service agreement has historically expired on april 30 of each year and is renegotiated for an additional oneyear term 

environmental matters 

there have been political legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ghg impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency these efforts and climate change itself have the potential to adversely affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows see part i item 1a risk factors for additional information 

the evergy companies have taken and will continue to take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses for example the evergy companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events including storms which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change in addition the evergy companies have invested and will continue to invest in grid resiliency much of the evergy companies infrastructure is aged and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems during severe weather the evergy companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion 

the evergy companies are committed to a longterm strategy to reduce carbon emissions in a costeffective and reliable manner public attention is currently focused on reducing emissions and closing coalfired generating units diversity of fuel supply has historically proven to provide benefits in terms of cost and reliability in addition the evergy companies must ensure that they prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the evergy companies to include in rates and avoid stranding assets by prematurely closing facilities the evergy companies use an integrated resource plan which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity the integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand fuel prices transmission improvements new generating capacity integration of renewables energy storage energy efficiency and demand response initiatives strategies that the evergy companies have pursued include 

  

 the evergy companies are also committed to transparency on its website wwwevergyinccom evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental social and governance matters including information related to emissions waste and water the content of the website and report is not incorporated into this filing

 item 1a risk factors 

utility regulatory risks 

prices are subject to regulatory review and may not prove adequate to recover costs or provide a fair return 

the prices that the evergy companies are allowed to charge their customers significantly influence their results of operations financial position and cash flows these prices are subject to the determination in large part of governmental entities including the mpsc kcc and ferc 

in general utilities are allowed to recover costs including a reasonable return on invested capital that were prudently incurred to provide utility service there can be no assurance however that regulators will determine such costs to have been prudently incurred further the amounts approved by the regulators may not be sufficient to allow for a recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments also amounts that were approved by regulators may be modified limited or eliminated by regulatory or legislative actions any decisions made by these regulators could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of evergy and its utility subsidiaries 

the evergy companies are also exposed to costrecovery shortfalls due to the inherent regulatory lag in the ratesetting process this is because utility rates are generally based on historical information and except for certain situations where regulators allow for recovery of expenses through use of a formula that tracks costs are not subject to adjustment between rate cases in connection with the merger westar energy and kcpl agreed to a fiveyear base rate moratorium in kansas beginning in december 2018 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition effective as of january 1 2019 kcpl and gmo elected into plantin service accounting pisa which by law requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following kcpls and gmos last general rate case see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary for additional information on pisa these and other factors may result in underrecovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment or both 

failure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances regulatory lag or other factors 

  

could lead to lowered credit ratings reduced access to capital markets increased financing costs lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures in response to competitive economic political legislative public perception and regulatory pressures evergy and its utility subsidiaries may be subject to rate moratoriums rate refunds limits on rate increases lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions including phasein plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period for the benefit of customers any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of the evergy companies 

regulatory requirements regarding utility operations may increase costs and may expose the evergy companies to compliance penalties or adverse rate consequences 

ferc the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and spp have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements such as vegetation management standards facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards in addition evergy is also subject to health safety and other requirements enacted by the occupational safety and health administration the department of transportation the department of labor and other federal and state agencies as discussed more fully under operational risks the nrc extensively regulates nuclear power plants including wolf creek the costs of complying with existing new or modified regulations standards and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in addition failure to meet quality of service reliability cybersecurity critical infrastructure protection operational or other standards and requirements could expose the evergy companies to penalties additional compliance costs or adverse rate consequences any of which could have a material adverse impact on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

environmental risks 

costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including those relating to ghg emissions are and may continue to be significant and may adversely impact operations and financial results 

the evergy companies are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal state and local environmental laws regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality waste management and hazardous substance disposal protected natural resources such as wetlands endangered species and other protected wildlife and health and safety for example westar energy kcpl and gmo combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide co 2  and other ghgs federal legislation regulates the emission of ghgs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce ghg emissions the environmental protection agency epa the kansas department of health and environment kdhe and the missouri department of natural resources mdnr regulate emissions under the clean air act amendments of 1990 caa water under the clean water act cwa and waste under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra among other laws and regulations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

compliance with these laws regulations and requirements entails significant capital and operating resources and the failure to comply could result in the imposition of substantial penalties including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions in addition there is a risk of lawsuits alleging violations of environmental laws regulations or requirements claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other relief certain federal courts have held that state and local governments and private parties have standing to bring climate change tort suits seeking companyspecific emission reductions and damages 

environmental permits are subject to periodic renewal which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits new facilities or modifications of existing facilities may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits delays in the environmental permitting process public opposition and challenges denials of permit applications limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects and thus materially adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in addition compliance with environmental laws 

  

regulations and requirements could alter the way assets are managed which in turn could result in retiring assets earlier than expected recording asset retirement obligations aros or having a regulator disallow recovery of costs that had been prudently incurred in connection with those assets 

costs of compliance with environmental laws regulations and requirements or fines penalties or negative lawsuit outcomes if not recovered in rates from customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

financial risks 

financial market disruptions or declines in the evergy companies credit ratings may increase financing costs andor limit access to the credit markets which may adversely affect liquidity and results 

the evergy companies rely on internally generated cash access to capital markets and shortterm credit to fund capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity disruption in capital markets increases in interest rates deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which the evergy companies rely any credit rating downgrade or any decrease in the market price of evergys common stock could have material adverse effects on the evergy companies these effects could include among others reduced access to capital and increased cost of borrowed funds dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices changes in the type andor increases in the amount of collateral or other credit support obligations required to be posted with contractual counterparties increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other postretirement benefit plan funding requirements reduced ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of evergy common stock rate case disallowance of costs of capital reductions in or delays of capital expenditures limitation in or the ability of evergy to provide credit support for its subsidiaries further westar energy and kcpl have outstanding taxexempt bonds that may be put back to the respective issuer at the option of the holder in addition market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on evergys lenders suppliers and other counterparties or customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations 

evergys holding company structure could limit its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and to service its debt obligations 

evergy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its direct subsidiaries particularly westar energy kcpl and gmo evergys subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide evergy with funds the ability of evergys subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions and accordingly evergys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the earnings and cash flows capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries as well as regulatory factors financial covenants general business conditions and other matters 

in addition the evergy companies are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends under the federal power act westar energy kcpl and gmo generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings in connection with approval of the merger in missouri each of kcpl and gmo agreed to not pay dividends to evergy if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services in connection with approval of the merger in kansas each of westar energy and kcpl agreed to not pay dividends to evergy if i the payment would result in an increase in the utilitys debt level excluding shortterm debt and debt due within one year above 60 percent of its total capitalization absent approval from the kcc or ii if its credit rating falls below bbb for sp global ratings or baa3 for moodys investor services as described elsewhere in this form 10k the evergy companies are parties to various financing agreements that contain requirements to maintain a certain financial condition that could restrict the amount of dividends the evergy companies are permitted to pay such as maintaining a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 065 to 100 evergy cannot guarantee dividends will be paid in the future or that if paid dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past 

  

in addition from time to time evergy has and may guarantee debt obligations of its subsidiaries under the financing agreements to which evergy is a party a guarantee of debt may be considered indebtedness for purposes of complying with financial covenants that dictate the extent to which evergy can borrow money and any guarantee payments could adversely affect evergys liquidity and ability to service its own debt obligations 

increasing costs associated with defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans health care plans and other employee benefits could adversely affect evergys financial position and liquidity 

a substantial number of evergys and wolf creeks employees participate in defined benefit retirement and other postretirement plans former employees also have accrued benefits in defined benefit retirement and other postretirement plans the costs of these plans depend on a number of factors including the rates of return on plan assets the level and nature of the provided benefits discount rates the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels changes in benefit design changes in laws or regulations and the amount of any required or voluntary contributions to the plans the evergy companies have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans also if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels if these plans experience adverse market returns on investments or if interest rates materially fall required or voluntary contributions to the plans could be material in addition changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs returns on investments interest rates and other actuarial assumptions including projected retirements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased in recent years and may continue to rise in the future future legislative changes related to health care could also cause significant changes to benefit programs and costs the increasing costs associated with health care plans could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the evergy companies use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage commodity and financial risks losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts if a counterparty fails to perform or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or the use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 

tax legislation and an inability to utilize tax credits could adversely impact the financial results and liquidity of the evergy companies 

major tax legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja was signed into law in december 2017 the tcja significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended irc and is generally effective january 1 2018 the tcja contains significant changes to federal corporate income taxation including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 limiting the deduction for net operating losses eliminating net operating loss carrybacks and eliminating the use of bonus depreciation on new capital investments the tcja reduced revenues and internally generated cash flows due to the reduced collection of taxes in customer prices which could adversely affect the financial results liquidity and credit ratings of the evergy companies there may be other material adverse effects of the legislation such as causing a reduction in deferred income tax assets and the financial results and liquidity of evergy could be adversely affected by the tcja 

over the last several years income tax obligations have been reduced due to the continued use of bonus depreciation provisions that allow for an acceleration of deductions for tax purposes and irs guidance on tax deductions for repairs although the tcja expands bonus depreciation in general it eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utilities on new capital investments the evergy companies regularly assess their future ability to utilize tax benefits including those in the form of net operating loss tax credit and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on its balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary a reduction in or disallowance of these tax benefits resulting from a legislative change or adverse determination by a taxing jurisdiction could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the 

  

evergy companies additionally changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes such as those resulting from the tcja as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the evergy companies 

in addition the evergy companies operate wind farms that generate production tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations the amount of production tax credits is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by wind farms and the applicable tax credit rate a variety of operating and economic parameters including transmission constraints adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment could significantly reduce the production tax credits generated by these wind farms which could have an adverse impact on the financial results of the evergy companies 

customer and weatherrelated risks 

the results of operations financial position and cash flows of evergy can be materially affected by changes in customer electricity consumption 

change in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the consumption of energy by customers federal and state programs exist to influence the way customers use energy and regulators have mandates to promote energy efficiency conservation programs and customers level of participation in the programs could impact the financial results of the evergy companies in adverse ways 

technological advances energy efficiency and other energy conservation measures have reduced and will continue to reduce customer electricity consumption the evergy companies generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost selfgeneration and distributed generation technologies including microturbines wind turbines fuel cells and solar cells as well as those related to the storage of energy produced by these systems have become competitive with the manner and price at which the evergy companies sell electricity there is also a perception that generating or storing electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels increased adoption of these technologies could reduce electricity demand and the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered resulting in under recovery of the fixed costs of the evergy companies increased selfgeneration and the related use of net energy metering which allows selfgenerating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power could put upward price pressure on remaining customers if the evergy companies are unable to adjust prices to reflect reduced electricity demand and increased selfgeneration and net energy metering their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions downturns or sluggishness in the economy or other factors may also adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

weather is a major driver of the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies and the evergy companies are subject to risks associated with climate change 

weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities the evergy companies are significantly impacted by seasonality and due to energy demand created by air conditioning load highest revenues are typically recorded in the third quarter unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales in addition severe weather and events including tornados snow fire rain flooding and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses lower revenues and additional capital restoration costs storm reserves established by the evergy companies may be insufficient to cover these increased costs and rates may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these increased costs additionally because many of the evergy companies generating stations utilize water for cooling low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations result in limited power production and require modifications to plant operations high water conditions can also impair planned deliveries of fuel to generating stations operated by the evergy companies climate change may produce more frequent or severe weather events such as storms droughts or floods and could also impact the economic 

  

health of evergys service territories an increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events or a deterioration in the economic health of evergys service territories could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

in addition political legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change such as efforts to reduce ghg emissions impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for lowcarbon generation and energy efficiency could result in reduced sales and require significant costs to respond to such efforts these efforts could also result in the early retirement of generation facilities which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments that were prudent when originally made any of the foregoing could adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

operational risks 

operational risks may adversely affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

the operation of electric generation transmission distribution and information systems involves many risks including breakdown or failure of equipment aging infrastructure operator error or contractor or subcontractor failure problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental safety or other regulatory requirements fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions labor disputes difficulties with the implementation or operation of information systems transmission scheduling constraints and catastrophic events such as fires floods droughts explosions terrorism severe weather or other similar occurrences many of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution resources are aged which increases the risk of unplanned outages reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense any equipment or system outage or constraint can among other things reduce sales increase costs and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics customer expectations and regulatory reliability and security requirements 

the evergy companies have general liability and property insurance to cover a portion of their facilities but such policies do not cover transmission or distribution systems are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage 

these and other operating events may reduce revenues or increase costs or both and may materially affect the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies 

physical and cybersecurity breaches criminal activity terrorist attacks and other disruptions to facilities or information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations expose the evergy companies or their customers or employees to a risk of loss expose the evergy companies to legal or regulatory liability and cause reputational and other harm 

the evergy companies rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity supply chain functions and the invoicing and collection of payments from customers the evergy companies also use information technology networks and systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements these networks and systems are in some cases owned or managed by thirdparty service providers in the ordinary course of business the evergy companies collect store and transmit sensitive data including operating information proprietary business information and personal information belonging to customers and employees 

the evergy companies information technology networks and infrastructure as well as the networks and infrastructure belonging to thirdparty service providers that the evergy companies utilize may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other unauthorized third parties error or 

  

malfeasance by one or more employees or service providers software or hardware upgrades additions or replacements malicious software code telecommunication failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could among other things impact the reliability or safety of the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems result in the erasure of data or render the evergy companies equipment or the equipment of thirdparty service providers unusable impact the evergy companies ability to conduct business in the ordinary course reduce sales expose the evergy companies and their customers employees and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of information and result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties damage the evergy companies reputation or otherwise harm their business the evergy companies can provide no assurance that they will identify and remedy all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remedied 

the evergy companies are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of their security customer and business information for example nerc has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updated and new requirements with which the utility industry must comply the nrc also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at nuclear power plants compliance with nerc and nrc rules and standards and rules and standards promulgated by other regulatory agencies from time to time or future legislation will increase the evergy companies compliance costs and their exposure to the potential risk of violations of these rules standards or future legislation which includes potential financial penalties furthermore the noncompliance of other utilities with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious security event at other utilities could result in increased regulation or oversight both of which could increase the evergy companies costs and impact their financial results 

additionally the evergy companies cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or terrorist attack may have on the energy industry in general the electric utility industry both within the united states and internationally has experienced physical and cybersecurity attacks on energy infrastructure such as power plants substations and related assets in the past and there will likely be more attacks in the future the evergy companies facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks the effects of such attacks could include disruption to the evergy companies generation transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general reduced sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the us economy any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the evergy companies operations or financial results 

the cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved 

the evergy companies business is capital intensive and regularly includes significant construction projects the risks of any capital project include actual costs may exceed estimated costs regulators may disallow limit or delay the recovery of all or part of the cost of or a return on a capital project risks associated with the capital and credit markets to fund projects delays in receiving or failure to receive necessary permits approvals and other regulatory authorizations unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts inadequate availability or increased cost of labor or materials including commodities such as steel copper and aluminum that may be subject to uncertain or increased tariffs inclement weather new or changed laws regulations and requirements including environmental and health and safety laws regulations and requirements and other events beyond the evergy companies control may occur that may materially affect the schedule cost and performance of these projects 

these and other risks could cause the evergy companies to defer or limit capital expenditures materially increase the costs of capital projects delay the inservice dates of projects adversely affect the performance of the projects and require the purchase of electricity on the wholesale market at potentially more expensive prices until the projects are completed thus these risks may significantly affect the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

failure of one or more generation plant coowners to pay their share of construction or operations and maintenance costs could increase the evergy companies costs and capital requirements 

the evergy companies are coowners of several large generation plants see item 2 properties for additional information failure by any other coowner to pay its proportionate share of capital and other costs could materially increase the evergy companies share of the costs disputes may also arise between coowners regarding operation of a plant or the sharing of expenses which could result in legal expenses and damages and adversely impact the evergy companies financial results 

the evergy companies are exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit which could adversely impact the evergy companies business and financial results 

evergy indirectly owns 94 of wolf creek with westar energy and kcpl each owning 47 of the nuclear plant the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities including wolf creek in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines shut down the facilities or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved additionally the noncompliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry such events could increase wolf creeks costs and impact the financial results of the evergy companies or result in a shutdown of wolf creek 

an extended outage of wolf creek whether resulting from nrc action an incident at the plant or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the evergy companies in the event replacement power and other costs are not recovered through rates or insurance if a longterm outage occurred the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base wolf creek was constructed prior to 1986 and the age of wolf creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs 

on an annual basis westar energy and kcpl are required to contribute money to taxqualified trusts that were established to pay for decommissioning costs at the end of the units life the amount of contributions varies depending on estimates of decommissioning expenses and projected return on trust assets if the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated westar energy and kcpl could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates 

the evergy companies are also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit including but not limited to i potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit ii the storage handling disposal and potential release by accident through thirdparty actions or otherwise of radioactive materials and iii uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units westar energy and kcpl are also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments subject to a cap per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage 

in addition wolf creek is reliant on a sole supplier for fuel and related services the supplier has in the past been the subject of chapter 11 reorganization proceedings and an extended outage of wolf creek could occur if the supplier is not able to perform under its contracts with wolf creek switching to another supplier could take an extended amount of time and would require nrc approval an extended outage at wolf creek could affect the amount of wolf creek investment included in customer rates and could have a material impact on the evergy companies financial results 

the structure of the regional power market in which the evergy companies operate could have an adverse effect on their results of operations financial position and cash flows 

westar energy kcpl and gmo are members of the spp regional transmission organization and each has transferred operational authority but not ownership of their transmission facilities to the spp the spps integrated marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run within the operating 

  

constraints of a unit at any given time for maximum costeffectiveness in the event that westar energys kcpls or gmos generating units are not among the lowest cost generating units operating within the market each could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales 

a market for transmission congestion rights tcr is also included as part of the integrated marketplace tcrs are financial instruments used to hedge transmission congestion charges westar energy kcpl and gmo acquire tcrs for the purpose of hedging against transmission congestion charges there is a risk that the entities could incorrectly model the amount of tcrs needed or that the tcrs acquired could be ineffective in hedging against transmission congestion charges either of which could lead to increased purchased power costs 

the rules governing the various regional power markets including the spp may change from time to time and such changes could impact the costs and revenues of the evergy companies 

litigation risks 

the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the evergy companies are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their respective businesses the outcome of these matters cannot be determined nor in many cases can the liability that could potentially result from each case be reasonably estimated the liability that the evergy companies may incur with respect to any of these cases may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and could adversely impact the financial results for the evergy companies 

risks related to the merger 

the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized 

the evergy companies have incurred and expect to incur additional significant costs associated with combining the operations of great plains energy and westar energy additional unanticipated costs may also be incurred in the integration of the businesses of great plains energy and westar energy the evergy companies expect the merger to produce various benefits including among other things operating efficiencies and cost savings however achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties including 

 no assurance can be given that these benefits will be achieved or if achieved the timing of their achievement integration costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of the evergy companies and a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger could impair evergys ability to repurchase shares and its ability to grow its earnings and dividend in addition the evergy companies may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of the companies including inconsistencies in standards systems and controls and managements focus and resources may be diverted from ordinary business activities and opportunities in order to focus on integration efforts any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the evergy companies 

the price of evergy common stock may experience volatility 

the price of evergy common stock may be volatile some of the factors that could affect the price of evergy common stock are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community the ability of the evergy companies to implement their integration strategy and to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from the merger the ability of evergy to implement its share repurchase program and speculation in the press or investment community about the evergy companies financial condition or results of operations general market conditions and us economic factors and political events 

  

unrelated to the performance of the evergy may also affect evergys stock price for these reasons shareholders should not rely on historical trends in the price of great plains energy or westar energy common stock to predict the price of evergys common stock or its financial results 

capital credit market conditions or future legislation may adversely impact evergys share repurchase program 

evergy expects to repurchase a significant number of shares over the next several years using a combination of existing cash on the balance sheet internally generated cash proceeds from capital markets activities and shortterm debt disruptions in capital and credit markets negative credit rating actions and volatility in the market price of evergys common stock may make capital more difficult and costlier to obtain may restrict liquidity and may adversely impact the ability to execute the share repurchase program in a timely or costeffective manner evergys ability to execute its share repurchase program could also be adversely impacted by the passage of federal legislation prohibiting or significantly restricting the ability of companies to repurchase shares of their own stock 

evergy has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results  

as required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap evergy recorded a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet in connection with completion of the merger evergy assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment if goodwill is deemed to be impaired evergy may be required to incur material noncash charges that could materially adversely affect its results of operations

earnings overview 

the following table summarizes evergys net income and diluted earnings per common share eps 



net income and diluted eps increased in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the inclusion of kcpls and gmos earnings beginning in june 2018 higher westar energy retail sales driven by favorable weather and lower income tax expense partially offset by mergerrelated costs and reductions of revenue for customer bill credits incurred following the close of the merger 

in addition a higher number of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding due to the issuance of common shares to great plains energy shareholders as a result of the merger diluted earnings per share 126 for 2018

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on evergys results of operations and financial position management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of evergys results of operations and financial position management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the evergy board 

  

pensions 

evergy incurs significant costs in providing noncontributory defined pension benefits the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 

pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age life expectancies compensation levels and employment periods earnings on plan assets the level of contributions made to the plan and plan amendments in addition pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 

the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weightedaverage of longterm returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan the assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation these assumptions updated annually at the measurement date are based on managements best estimates and judgment however material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 

the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 05 increase or a 05 decrease in key actuarial assumptions for evergys qualified pension plans each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only  



pension expense for westar energy kcpl and gmo is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the kcc and mpsc the orders allow the difference between pension costs under gaap and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds as appropriate 

in 2018  evergys pension expense was 901 million  under gaap and 984 million  for ratemaking the impact on 2019  pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on gaap pension costs under the evergy companies rate agreements any increase or decrease in gaap pension expense would be deferred in a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions 

market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan it is difficult to predict future pension costs changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions 

revenue recognition 

evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by evergy unbilled revenues are recorded for kwh usage in the period following the customers billing cycle to the end of the 

  

month this estimate is based on net system kwh usage less actual billed kwhs evergys estimated unbilled kwhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates evergys unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand weather line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes see note 4 for the balance of unbilled receivables for evergy as of december 31 2018 and 2017 

regulatory assets and liabilities 

evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers 

management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc kcc or ferc in evergys rate case filings decisions in other regulatory proceedings including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to evergy and changes in laws and regulations if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations evergys continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules in the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of evergys operations the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided additionally these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairments of assets and goodwill 

longlived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under gaap 

accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill to identify potential impairment in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value evergys consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis evergys first impairment test for the 23389 million of goodwill from the great plains energy and westar energy merger will be conducted on may 1 2019 

evergy anticipates that the determination of fair value for the reporting unit will consist of two valuation techniques an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using market multiples derived from the historical revenue earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization net utility asset values and market prices of stock of peer companies the results of the two techniques will be evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considers representative of fair value for the reporting unit which involves a significant amount of management judgment 

the discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows management will determine the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the kcc and mpsc and aftertax cost of debt estimated future cash flows are based on evergys internal business plan which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future such as the outcome of future rate filings future approved rates of return on equity anticipated earningsreturns related to future capital investments continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions 

  

differ significantly from the current assumptions revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 

the market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by managements selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock management will determine an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry changes in results of peer companies selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the evergy reporting unit 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the assetliability approach deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses capital losses and tax credit carryforwards evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in evergys consolidated financial statements or tax returns actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities this process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations 

evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of such assets concurrent with the recognition of the liability the estimated cost of the aro incurred at the time the related longlived assets were either acquired placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective the recording of aros for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability 

evergy initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 94 share retire wind generating facilities dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills among other items aro refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity in determining evergys aros assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on evergys aros reflected on its consolidated balance sheets 

as of december 31 2018 and 2017 evergy had recorded aros of 6871 million and 4051 million respectively see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding evergys aros 

evergy results of operations   

evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation fuel costs weather customer behavior and demand the economy and competitive forces 

substantially all of evergys revenues are subject to state or federal regulation this regulation has a significant impact on the price the evergy companies charge for electric service evergys results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending both operating and capital within the frameworks established by its regulators 

  

wholesale revenues are impacted by among other factors demand cost and availability of fuel and purchased power price volatility available generation capacity transmission availability and weather 

the evergy companies primarily use coal and uranium for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power on the open market the prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply demand weather and the broader economic environment westar energy kcpl and gmo have fuel recovery mechanisms in their kansas and missouri jurisdictions as applicable that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund through customer rates substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding 

weather significantly affects the amount of electricity that evergys customers use as electricity sales are seasonal as summer peaking utilities the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the evergy companies hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand especially among residential and commercial customers and to a lesser extent industrial customers mild weather reduces customer demand 

energy efficiency investments by customers and the evergy companies also can affect the demand for electric service through the missouri energy efficiency investment act meeia kcpl and gmo offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their missouri retail customers and recover program costs throughput disincentive and as applicable certain performance incentives in retail rates through a rider mechanism 

the following table summarizes evergys comparative results of operations 



evergy utility gross margin and mwh sales 

utility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with gaap utility gross margin as used by the evergy companies is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the spp for network transmission costs expenses for fuel and purchased power costs offset by wholesale sales margin are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms as a result changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income in addition spp network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by spp members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the spp rto as with fuel and purchased power costs changes in spp network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which evergy reflects spp revenues and expenses 

  

management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the evergy companies operations across periods compared with operating revenues because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the evergy board the evergy companies definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies 

the following tables summarize evergys utility gross margin and mwhs sold

the following are significant balance sheet changes in addition to those due to the great plains energy and westar energy merger 



  



liquidity and capital resources   

evergy relies primarily upon cash from operations shortterm borrowings debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements evergys capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures payment of contractual obligations and other commitments the payment of dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of common shares 

capital sources 

cash flows from operations 

evergys cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity these cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions future regulatory proceedings the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages andor storms 

shortterm borrowings 

as of december 31 2018  evergy had 17 billion of available borrowing capacity from its master credit facility and receivable sale facilities westar energys kcpls and gmos borrowing capacity under the master credit facility also support their issuance of commercial paper the available borrowing capacity consisted of 4490 million from evergy incs master credit facility 5700 million from westar energys credit facilities 4204 million from kcpls credit facilities and 2979 million from gmos credit facilities see notes 4  and 11  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the receivable sale facilities and master credit facility respectively along with cash flows from operations evergy generally uses these liquid resources to meet its daytoday cash flow requirements 

longterm debt and equity issuances 

from time to time evergy issues longterm debt andor equity to repay shortterm debt refinance maturing longterm debt and finance growth as of december 31 2018  and 2017 evergy’s capital structure excluding shortterm debt was as follows 



after the completion of its common stock repurchase program evergy anticipates targeting a common equity to total capitalization ratio of approximately 4750 following the utilization of its excess cash and cash equivalents discussed further below evergy anticipates issuing debt in 2019 in support of its common stock 

  

repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements  common stock repurchase program for additional information 

under stipulations with the mpsc and kcc evergy westar energy and kcpl are required to maintain common equity at not less than 35 40 and 40 respectively of total capitalization the master credit facility and certain debt instruments of the evergy companies also contain restrictions that require the maintenance of certain capitalization and leverage ratios as of december 31 2018  the evergy companies were in compliance with these covenants 

significant debt issuances 

see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding significant debt issuances 

credit ratings 

the ratings of the evergy companies debt securities by the credit rating agencies impact their liquidity including the cost of borrowings under their master credit facility and in the capital markets the evergy companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as vital to their access to and cost of debt financing and to that end maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations financial position and future prospects while a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of the evergy companies debt it could increase interest charges under the master credit facility a decrease in credit ratings could also have among other things an adverse impact which could be material on the evergy companies access to capital the cost of funds the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and evergys ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 

  

as of february 21 2019 the major credit rating agencies rated the evergy companies securities as detailed in the following table

contractual obligations and other commitments 

in the course of its business activities the evergy companies enter into a variety of contracts and commercial commitments some of these result in direct obligations reflected on evergys consolidated balance sheets while others are commitments some firm and some based on uncertainties not reflected in evergys underlying consolidated financial statements 

the information in the following table is provided to summarize evergys cash obligations and commercial commitments 



 longterm debt includes current maturities longterm debt principal excludes 572 million  of unamortized net discounts and debt issuance costs and a 1448 million  fair value adjustment recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the great plains energy and westar energy merger variable rate interest obligations are based on rates as of december 31 2018  

  

operating lease commitments include leases for office buildings computer equipment operating facilities vehicles and rail cars to serve jointlyowned generating units where westar energy or kcpl is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other jointowners for its proportionate share of the cost capital lease commitments include obligations for both principal and interest 

evergy expects to contribute 1183 million  to the pension and other postretirement plans in 2019  of which the majority is expected to be paid by westar energy and kcpl additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2023  in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa or regulatory funding requirements however these amounts have not yet been determined amounts for years after 2019 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2019 actual amounts for years after 2019 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above 

fuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel coal and coal transportation costs power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business 

evergy has other insignificant longterm liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018  which do not have a definitive cash payout date and are not included in the table above 

common stock dividends 

the amount and timing of dividends payable on evergys common stock are within the sole discretion of the evergy board the amount and timing of dividends declared by the evergy board will be dependent on considerations such as evergys earnings financial position cash flows capitalization ratios regulation reinvestment opportunities and debt covenants evergy targets a longterm dividend payout ratio of 60 to 70 of earnings see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the common stock dividend declared by the evergy board in february 2019 

the evergy companies also have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements corporate organizational documents covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels see note 17  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments 

common stock repurchase program 

in july 2018 the evergy board authorized the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of evergys common stock although this repurchase authorization has no expiration date evergy expects to repurchase approximately 60 million shares by mid2020 for 2018  evergy had total repurchases of common stock of approximately 1042 million and had repurchased 164 million shares under the repurchase program these repurchase totals include shares repurchased under asr agreements one of which had not reached final settlement as of december 31 2018 and are discussed further below

see note 17  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding evergys common stock repurchase program 

  

impact of tcja 

the tcja will result in lower operating cash flows for the evergy companies due to lower income tax expense recoveries in customer rates and the settlement of related deferred income tax regulatory liabilities which are significant these decreases in operating cash flows are expected to exceed the increase in operating cash flows for the evergy companies resulting from the lower corporate federal income tax rate primarily due to the utilization of the evergy companies net operating losses and tax credits these net regulatory liabilities will be refunded in future rates by amortizing amounts related to plant assets primarily over the remaining useful life of the assets and amortizing the amounts related to the other items over various periods as determined in the evergy companies 2018 rate cases 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries such agreements include for example guarantees and letters of credit these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a standalone basis thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiarys intended business purposes in connection with the closing of the merger evergy assumed the guarantees previously provided to gmo by great plains energy the majority of these agreements guarantee evergys own future performance so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded 

at december 31 2018  evergy has provided 1113 million  of credit support for gmo as follows 

 evergy has also guaranteed gmos shortterm debt including its commercial paper program at december 31 2018  gmo had 1500 million  of commercial paper outstanding none of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if gmos credit ratings were downgraded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

in the ordinary course of business evergy faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such risks principally include business legal operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis see part i item 1a risk factors and part ii item 7 mda for further discussion of risk factors 

the evergy companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply interest rates and equity prices commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energyrelated products credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates in addition evergys investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and to fund nonqualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk 

management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on evergys operating results during the ordinary course of business the evergy companies hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation though management believes its risk management practices are effective it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk evergy could experience losses which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position due to many factors including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets regulatorydriven market rule changes andor bankruptcy or nonperformance of customers or counterparties andor failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 

hedging strategies 

from time to time evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies derivative instruments such as futures forward contracts swaps or options derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 

commodity price risk 

the evergy companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity and are exposed to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energyrelated products exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels evergys exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the costbased regulation of its regulated operations in kansas and missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through costrecovery mechanisms primarily through fuel recovery mechanisms while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results 

interest rate risk 

evergy manages interest rate risk and short and longterm liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt to a percentage of total debt diversifying maturity dates and from time to time entering into interest rate hedging transactions at december 31 2018  4 of evergys longterm debt was variable rate debt evergy also has shortterm borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt that are exposed to interest rate risk evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100basispoint change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 

evergy had 17470 million of variable rate debt including notes payable and commercial paper and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december 31 2018  a 100basispoint change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately 125 million 

  

at december 31 2018 evergy had 5000 million of notional amounts of fixedtofloating interest rate swaps that had been designated as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted debt issuance in 2019 assuming settlement of the swaps a hypothetical 10 decrease in the interest rates underlying the swaps would have resulted in an approximately 128 million increase in interest expense that would have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense over the period that the hedged interest payments affected earnings 

credit risk 

evergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure the credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by evergys large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates the evergy companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms such as letters of credit when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure 

investment risk 

evergy maintains trust funds as required by the nrc to fund its 94 share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain nonqualified retirement benefits as of december 31 2018  these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on evergys balance sheet the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors 

as nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for the vast majority of these securities as an offset to its regulatory asset for decommissioning wolf creek and as such fluctuations in the value of these securities do not have a material impact on evergys earnings a significant decline in the value of pension or nonqualified retirement assets could require evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods in addition a decline in the fair value of these plan assets in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by evergy could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by evergy
